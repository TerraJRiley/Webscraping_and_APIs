Realized I was the other woman,"I‚Äôm not sure what to make of this situation, considering the incident took place a year ago but...

Last year, I went to a party and hooked up with a girl. I didn‚Äôt know her well at all but we had a few mutual friends and I clearly thought she was cute. We didn‚Äôt actually have sex the first night because her roommate walked in and I bolted. Like a true rom com, I somehow left one of my earrings and she was so gracious to return it to me the next day or so. I wasn‚Äôt expecting sex, but one thing led to another and yeah. Two days later she had a girlfriend... or so I thought. She‚Äôs been with her girlfriend the entire time since then and still continues to contact me nearly every day. Let me reiterate that I didn‚Äôt know her at all before hooking up, and the sex was exactly what you‚Äôd expect from two college students who don‚Äôt know each other. 

I‚Äôm like a nonconfrontational person, so I stay pretty cordial with her. Refuse to flirt because I‚Äôm not interested and she‚Äôs in a relationship. Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty cold even though she‚Äôs expressed her interest in friendship. But I stay cordial because we have a lot of mutual friends.

Fast forward to this weekend where we‚Äôre all hanging out and someone asks her how long she‚Äôs been with her girlfriend... her response? A year and a half.

Excuse me... what? 

We hooked up a year ago. She said she was single. I took her for her word because why wouldn‚Äôt I? Was it suspicious that she was in a relationship suddenly two days later? Yes... but in the moment she was supposed to be single.

So now I‚Äôm working through a lot of emotions. I had a dream that offered me some clarity but it keeps bugging me for some reason. I don‚Äôt know. I would never consent to being the ‚Äúother woman,‚Äù so being that unbeknownst to myself makes me feel... well, gross. ",actuallesbians

Being closeted and around homophobes 24/7 is taking a toll on me mentally. I need help.,"My parents are major bible thumpers. They would rather me be a murderer than a lesbian. You may see this statement as a hyperbole, but I say it with almost 99.9% accuracy.

I‚Äôm so tired of having to listen to this abuse and nobody knows. Nobody knows how deep it cuts and how much it takes a toll on me. Nobody knows that I spend everyday in fear of someone outing me.

[F21] Fantasies having lesbian sex with mature women in 40s,"Girl grew up in a traditional family. Only one boyfriend since 16, though he is also conservative in sex and would love some more spicy things, we love each other. Healthy sex and keep having orgasms with him. Believe we love each other.

However, months ago started having a special fantasy. Drives me crazy just to think I could be kissed, licked and fingered by one or more mature experienced women in their 40s. Anywhere. Executives, teachers, doctors... Hot mature. No men involved. Do not consider myself lesbian, but it really turns me on and keep masturbating myself thinking about it. 

Never had mother relationship issue. Healthy childhood. But sexual intense, spent hours per day masturbating and watching porn. Lately mature women with younger girls videos.

Any girl of my age range with similar fantasies here?  Or any mature women having relations with young girls?  
Both scenarios would be excellent to share thoughts and ask questions.

I had a date on thursday...,"We have lots of things in common but was kinda worried before the date - that feeling ""is she gonna like me/find me attractive??""

When I saw her, oh my! I just thought ""holly shit, how pretty she is üò®""

She was wearing jeans, sports sneakers and a jacket. Many people would find it pretty normal/common, but there is something is this basic style that really gets me. I don't care about fashion clothes or make up, the more natural she looks, the prettier. She got me right there.

We had a great dinner together in a bar, nice music as well. We had fun.

I knew she was having fun as well but wasn't sure if she liked me as more than a friend. Then she invited me for a walk and took me to a street where LGBT people use to party. Then she held me close and kissed me.

Omg. What a kiss, all I can think of is that fucking kiss.. 

We stayed there kissing and telling each other funny stories about us, it was a great evening but unfortunately it lasted only 2 hours because the subway was going to close..

Then she messaged me saying she loved it, but wanted more... and on the next day she said she was missing my delicious lips..

Is it possible to miss someone after only 2 days? And have nothing else going on in your mind, except her face, her beautiful smile and the way she kissed you? And hope the week goes fast so you can see her again..

Advice on (what feels like) unrequited love *Juicy*,"It's 2014 and we're madly in love.  It was the kind of bliss I can't let go of, even after all this time. 

(we've been apart since shortly after (2015) and she has since been sober 2 yrs, which was a large reason we broke up) 

I recently ended a two year relationship (with another person) that was empty and sad. The first thing I did (not literally but in terms of moving on) was reach out to my ex, who I thought about every day. She told me she was hoping I'd call her someday, and that we could be connected again. Fast forward a few months, and one cross country trip: she's still *emotionally* involved her most recent EX.... it's a guy, she says she feels obligated to care for him as he experiences some severe mental illness &amp; has threatened suicide. She says she loves me and wants to be with me, but we can't get a clear intention on what the timeline is of her letting him go and us officially getting back together. 

Some days I feel like on an episode of the bachelorette, others I feel that with patience things will be alright. 

I'm trying to practice patience, understanding, and love with her, but I just want to know: 
Is this plausible? am i delusional in thinking that it's possible for us to heal and move forward?  

Details: 
She and I both have some issues with communicating and often let things go unsaid, I NEED words of affirmation and her love language is very different (physical touch). 

Should I trust that our love is strong enough to transcend this hard time, or am I settling for less than what I deserve? I read a poem that said you never have to wait for someone to meet you on the ""bridge""... but is it really that black and white?  

Thank you for your kindness and any insight, storytelling, or advice you're willing to share. XO. ",actuallesbians

Need advice about my wife (both of us 26/f),"Two days ago my wife texted to ask if it was okay to go out to drinks with coworkers after her shift, she said she probably wouldn't go because she still had a lot of work to do and if she did go she probably wouldn't stay long. I had a migraine and wanted to spend time with her (the two nights previous to this she had to work until midnight at her second job so we hadn't seen each other since sunday) but I dont like to tell her what to do so I said it was fine. I got off work at 4:30, she got off work at 6:30. I spent the evening laying on the couch, miserable. 

I texted her at around 7 asking if she'd be home soon, she said probably. I texted her right after saying that I was sad she wasn't home and I didn't feel good still and I wished she would come home because I missed her, all she said back was ""I'm sorry baby"" I sent her the eye roll emoji and told her to stay out if she wanted and I was going to go to bed soon anyway. 

I went to bed at 9 and woke up at 2 am and she still wasn't home. 2 is last call in our area, so i figured she was still out and was just going to have a bad day tomorrow as she worked at 6 am. 

I fell back asleep and woke up at 4, she still wasn't home. Usually if she's out and has too much to drink she'll get an uber home and then pick her car up the next day. I tried calling her twice to see where she was but her phone was saying the number wasn't in service for some reason. 

I woke up at 6 for work (going into work on my day off with a migraine after my wife never came home, fun!) and I had three texts from her.

-I'm sorry. I stayed at someone's house so I wouldn't drive

-And I'm late to work

-I'm a piece of shit

So already I was pissed because she never came home, never told me where she was going, and left me home alone after knowing I was sick. I sent her a long text telling her all this. she said I'm so sorry. I said whose house did you stay at? She said a girl from work, Linda. I said did you sleep on the couch? She didn't answer. I didn't really suspect she would cheat, I honestly was just trying to guilt trip her and show her that anything could've happened and I wouldn't know because she wasn't telling me where she was, not healthy I know, but I should lay out all the facts here. 

At two I started to feel bad about everything so I texted Hows work? No answer. 

At 4:45 I asked again and she said just finished. I said how was it? she said pretty awful. I figured it was from being hungover and late. 

Something about my wife is she doesn't stop drinking when she starts until she runs out of beer or someone drags her away. When she's sober she is the sweetest person in the world, always telling me how much she loves me and loves our life. We bought a house together in march and quickly after adopted a dog. She's funny and a hard worker, plus super laid back. If she gets home before me she will start making dinner (something I struggle with). But she's a mean drunk. I refuse to go out to drinks with her anymore because the last three times we did she made everyone uncomfortable when I wanted to go, either ignoring me and going to the bar for another beer, or passive aggressively making comments about how she wishes she could stay but I'm making her go. I went to a friends house for a bbq two months ago when another friend was in from a few states away and my wife made a big scene when I jokingly offered to give our dog away. 

When I got home from work yesterday my wife was sitting in the living room. I asked her why her day was awful and she said ""I need to tell you something."" 

I asked her what but she wouldn't say. I asked her if it had something to do with Linda and she nodded. I asked her if she cheated on me and she nodded. I asked her what she did and she said she didn't want to say. I asked her if they had sex and she said yes. 

We sent the rest of the night crying and trying to figure out what we would do. We own a house together. We are legally married but were planning on having a party in october and we just sent out invites to that this week. We've only been married a month. This is so shitty. 

I don't want to leave her, but I don't really feel comfortable being with her. I still love her so much. I asked her why she did it, why not leave after one drink like she was planning to, why not take an uber home instead of going to some lady's house, why not sleep on the couch? She says she doesn't remember what led up to it. I asked if she remembered it happening, she said yes, so I asked why she didn't stop it all then? I can't remember what she said, but she told me she had a drinking problem. I asked her if she didn't know why she did it, whats to stop it from happening again? She said this is.

She said I was the best thing that ever happened to her, and she loves our life together and doesn't want to lose me. But then she said she would be willing to do whatever I want to do. I asked her what she wanted to do, she said whatever I wanted to do. 

I don't know what to do. She didn't keep it a secret, which is good I guess... But it still happened. I could drink all the liquor in the world and I would never ever ever do this to her. I wish things could just go back to how they were before. Now I just feel awkward around her. She's mopping around. Everything is different. What should I do?

tldr; wife cheated on me one month  into our marriage, says it was a drunk mistake and it will never happen again, says she wants to handle it however I want to",actuallesbians

Anyway, my girl and I are going out for almost a year now. We're both in our 30s and we both have stable jobs. The thing is, I'm her first girlfriend. She had boyfriends in the past and that's about it.

You see, I'm very open to my family and friends about my sexuality. My family knows her well and they adore her which is really nice.

However, her family does not have a single clue about her being gay. I've never met anyone from her family, nor she plans to introduce me to her clan in the future. I live in the shadows and that hurts me a lot.

I am a very affectionate person and I have this habit of stealing kisses on the cheeks or forehead when I'm in public. But the tragedy is that I can't do it with her. She gets upset and scowls at me.

Super happy with my gf! (Update!),"Check out the other 2 posts I made about the little piece of perfection that is my girlfriend first for context!

Hi everyone! I mentioned that I would update you on how things went with her. I forgot a little, but here it is!

First off I that want to say that I am as happy as I think it's possible for a human. Things are going smoothly and beautifully. We've come very close now that we have spent more time together. We talk about anything for hours and we just click so well. One day we even spent 3 hours talking on the phone about aliens and how the universe might end! 

School started last week and we only have 1 class together every 2 days. But that's okay, it's really hard for me to focus on history with her over there lmao.  We spend the morning together in the library before class starts and it's so beautiful. We sit in a table where we are kinda hidden so we can secretly kiss! It's so cute I don't know how I can handle it. The best part is that now her parents let her come to my house more often, with the excuse of doing ""homework"" ;) Well ww actually do homework sometimes, but we mostly cuddle and eat tons of food lmao, nothing beyond that point (for now hehe). 

Well that's all I'm gonna say for now because I think I've revealed more details than I should have lol. Also I know this is so childish, but I am fucking loving it üòä.

"[Rant] Ugh, should I just give up?","I recently met an amazing woman on Her after being screwed around by my ex-girlfriend. We voice/video verified and she only lives 20 minutes from me, perfect right? Wrong!

Our first date was suppose to be on August 29th, but she got called into work last minute to cover someone else's shift at the restaurant where she works as a chef. I understood, and we agreed to meet for a quick lunch the next day, but it got cut short because the lunch line was long and I had to get back to work myself. We did meet in person but it was just long enough to order lunch, and she's even more breathtakingly beautiful than in her pictures.

Since then, we've been texting like crazy, but we haven't been able to meet up again due to conflicting work schedules, and now to top it all off I've been told by the record label that I'm associated with (I'm an audio engineer who has a lot of clients that come from a certain major label) that I need to head to Europe starting next week until November to produce an album with a singer who I've worked with before. I really don't want to go, because A) I really want to try to start something with the woman, and B) The singer is a perfectionist, very controlling and demanding. It's not unusual for me to work 12-18 hour days, 6 days a week with her, even going as far to sleep in the studio and not shower/change my clothes for up to five days. The only good thing is that she pays a premium for my services and she listens to the direction I want to go with the album.

It‚Äôs hard to talk to girls when you‚Äôre autistic,God I‚Äôm just so fucking lonely. I‚Äôm shy and I‚Äôm on the spectrum and I‚Äôve been single for over 2 years (only had 1 relationship and it destroyed a large part of my self esteem bc my ex is only attracted to guys so I still feel like I had a whole year wasted and was used). I want to meet girls but I hate going to loud an noisy places and I‚Äôm still underage so no bars. I‚Äôve had tinder for over a year and I‚Äôve had a ton of matches but the few conversations I have have always fizzled out. I‚Äôm in college rn and seeing everyone having a good time hurts sometimes. The few friends I have never seem to want anything to do with me. I‚Äôm so fucking alone. I look and act like a child so I don‚Äôt blame anyone for not being interested it just really hurts when I think about how different I am. Sometimes I just want to curl up into a ball and not leave my bed for days. I just want to hold someone‚Äôs hand sometimes idk. This is really disorganized I‚Äôm sorry ,actuallesbians

Guys are trying to lie about their identities to get into my pants‚Ä¶ help please?,"So, I have a policy with dating where I don‚Äôt care what genitals someone has, I only go by their gender.

Like if a trans woman approached me, I‚Äôd be down regardless of what genitals she had; but if a trans man approached me, I‚Äôd have to turn them down regardless of what genitals they have.

Unfortunately, guys have not taken kindly to this, and now they‚Äôre lying and pressuring me into doing it with them. I now have guys saying to me ‚Äúwell, I identify as trans mtf‚Äù, when they very clearly don‚Äôt, and they‚Äôre just tying to bone me. Keep in mind that I‚Äôm not denying them if they are actually trans, I know these people, I‚Äôve known them for years, and they‚Äôve never mentioned it outside of with me.

This is really starting to get under my skin and is making me less willing to trust people. I don‚Äôt wanna be transphobic, but at the same time, I absolutely do not wanna fuck cis/trans men pretending to be something they‚Äôre not.

It‚Äôs a really hard conundrum, and I‚Äôm honestly worried it‚Äôll bite me in the ass one day when I refuse to date someone who‚Äôs actually a trans woman, but just acts really suspicious.

I could use some help on how to deal with this. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to tackle this",actuallesbians
Super excited to date,"There's a girl I've been seeing for a little while and she's really amazing. Things aren't official, but we're getting there and she's the first serious relationship I've had. I'm so excited to take her on dates. So excited to do cute little stuff for her. She saw some of my drawings and jokingly said she wants me to draw her a picture. I'm gonna do it and have a good idea of what I want to draw for her. I also want to take her to this restaurant in a neighboring city that she's really wanted to go to. I want to do so much and a bunch of ideas go through my mind every time I'm with her. I'm just so fuckin excited. But until we can find time to go to that restaurant, I'll just take her to get ice cream this week XD 

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, I'm still in the closet and that complicates things. I'm working on it because I really don't want to push her away and ruin this. Thinking about it for the past few weeks has made me so anxious, but I know it's something I have to do if I want our relationship to reach its full potential. I feel like I need to be at least partially out before I ask her to be my girlfriend. This whole thing makes me so excited and so terrified at the same time, it's insane. ",actuallesbians
Don‚Äôt know where else to vent,"For most of my post-college life I‚Äôve been struggling with loneliness. I struggled with my sexuality for the better part of my teenage years to early adulthood. While all I was dealing with my inner struggles many of my close friends moved away, started their own families, got married etc.

Fast forward a few years and I meant the woman whom at the time I thought I spend the rest of my life with. That turned out to be a devasting mistake. She hurt me badly, cheated through most of the relationship, and pretty much gas-lighted me. It took awhile but eventually I got to the place where I moved past this heartache. The only problem is that now more than ever I‚Äôm alone. I don‚Äôt have any friends left except one who I see and talk to occasionally. 

My job doesn‚Äôt really lend itself to an active social life. I work evenings and usually sleep or work-out during the day. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve tried the whole hobbies thing and I meet people but never anything that grows into a friendship. Now if I want to goto a concert, restaurant, movie, whatever I‚Äôm usually alone. 


My romantic life is in even worse condition. Dating as a lesbian on a good day isn‚Äôt the easiest thing in the world. The last legit date I had was over two years ago. I made the mistake of dating a co-worker who became obsessive fairly quickly and made work very uncomfortable. Dating apps seem daunting to me hoping that people will pick you based mostly on your looks I think it would be pretty soul-crushing for someone like me.

I‚Äôm an average chick, with a decent career, and no social life. I just don‚Äôt how or if I can ever break out of this cycle. I don‚Äôt mean to come off as whiny or pathetic, nor am I bitter. I guess more than anything I just feel defeated and wanted to vent in a place that I felt comfortable.",actuallesbians

Finally came out (mostly)....,"So this past Labor Day weekend I officially came out to my family, all except my parents. NGL, my parents are the ones that scare me the most. Any time I hint at being gay I get a comment along the lines of ""don't even go there""  I've always been given the impression by them that it is completely unacceptable- basically have been told so in one way or another my whole life.

Anyhow, I'm actually really happy with how it went with the rest of my family, mainly cousins, but also my brother. He's the one I was most afraid to tell that weekend, but he was really great about it. Told me straight up that he loves me and just wants me to be happy and stressed that he is in no way our father and it doesn't bother him at all. ü§©

Confused mother,"Even as a kid, I had this attraction to girls I always just felt was normal, and not anything more than thinking they're pretty. Noticed when girls started getting chests,etc. I grew up as a tomboy, and even liked dressing like a boy to confuse the neighborhood girls and make them like me in late elementary. Played soft ball, played football at recess, was a gamer, etc. 
I really don't know why I didn't realize it was more than just for fun. 

As I got older I just went after guys, I had fun with them,  enjoyed the sex, etc. But as I become older I've realized I'm not really sexually attracted to them. I look at girl porn 100% of the time. I find women more attractive. I swoon over them. 

I've seen a few romance movies, and while they're cute, I was mostly attracted to the idea of someone loving me like that, not necessarily a man. 
I watched v for vendetta, and the story of the lesbian couple really made me reflect and realize I love the idea of being in a woman/woman relationship. 

I do love my fiance, but he can tell I'm not really sexually involved (although with recent weight gain I blame most of that on self confidence issues).

I've brought this up to him and were not really sure what to do about it.

I had a sexual dream a month or so ago. Of me and a woman playing in the sheets, laughing, kissing eachother everywhere, and me going down on her. I woke up steamy as hell. I've never had a dream like that about a man. 

I don't really want to break up our family over confusion. What if I don't end up enjoying a female relationship? At the same time i dont wanna become that person living a lie their whole life and leaving their spouse for someone in 20 years either.

To my fellow sober raptors,"Tonight was a difficult night for me, sobriety-wise. One of those nights where you can‚Äôt point to a specific trigger, and it feels like the world is coming down around you.

I‚Äôve been sober for 16 months and 3 weeks today, but there are days when it feels like my active drinking days were yesterday. When all the work I‚Äôve put in, the long days and long nights, the AA meetings, the time and energy I‚Äôve spent avoiding that first drink mean nothing, and it‚Äôs at the back of my mind.

Some days I feel on top of the world - happy, content, accomplished, and sober. Others, like today, hit me like a freight train and try to steal away all of my progress. 

So tonight, after sobbing the hour drive home from an event to my girlfriend‚Äôs house before she got home from work, I asked my girlfriend‚Äôs kind roommate and her girlfriend to sit with me for a couple minutes while I cried and let out all of the reasons why I wanted to drink, and the reasons that I should choose not to. And they did. They sat with me for an hour, and made me smile and laugh for 90% of it.

I write to you all on r/actuallesbians because I hope that another sober raptor can find solace in that it does get easier, though it is one-day-at-a-time progress. 

The advice I can give is to always reach out, even when it feels like the world wants nothing to do with you and your battles.

Pick up the phone and call until someone picks up.

Talk it out, cry it out, or even yell it out to someone else until you can take a full, deep breath. And then keep taking deep breaths until you no longer need to think through the process. 

We find strength in connection, and peace in communication. 

Together, we can accomplish anything. 

And to the struggling raptors wondering about their drinking habits or how their drinking may be impacting their day-to-day lives, remember, there are so many people in this world who will love you until you can learn to love yourself. And they will listen, and hold your hand, until you can stand up on your own. 

Each and every one of you is beautiful, strong, and courageous, in so many colorful ways. Much love to this subreddit, thank you for always being a bright spot when I open this thread in the morning (and before I go to sleep.)

RANT is it possible we‚Äôre just friends?,"I‚Äôm newly out n dating (within the last 6 months) and I‚Äôm currently talking to a girl, M. We met on tinder where we both clearly stated our interest for women in the bio (I‚Äôm les, she‚Äôs bi). 

We first made plans and I nervously stood her up (I know it was wrong!! But we also didn‚Äôt confirm time/place and hadn‚Äôt yet exchanged numbers, just tinder). Luckily she understood when I apologized and explained how intimidated I was by her. So we planned a real first date. 

I took her out for tacos, it was awkward at times but within normal date levels of awkwardness. She told me she‚Äôs demisexual and has no desire for a sexual partner at this time which is fine with me. She mentioned making out with people in the past, but I‚Äôm not clear if that‚Äôs something she wants or something she‚Äôs uncomfortable with, so I haven‚Äôt made any moves to kiss her. 

We‚Äôve hung out many times now and for some reason I get the idea she only thinks of me as a friend? Sometimes we are very flirty but never anything physical (I never want to make her uncomfortable by trying to hold her hand or anything!!). We‚Äôll buy each other dinner, share meals, do face masks together and watch netflix in bed... but these are all things straight girl friends do too. 

She‚Äôs also an artist and wants us to do a shoot in a few days with a lesbian 1920s erotica theme. Last time we hung out I went back to her house after I sat in my car for a few minutes, determined to confess my feelings right then and there, but she was tired when I left and ended up crashing almost immediately so we didn‚Äôt get to talk. 

I‚Äôm thinking of inviting her to LA (about an hour and a half from where we live, kinda long for it to be awkward) tomorrow to go to a flea market and maybe get brunch/talk about my feelings/etc. But part of me feels like there‚Äôs nothing there and I should stop pursuing a girl who‚Äôs obv not interested.

Scared as hell but in a good place,"2 years ago, I broke up with my first love after 2.5 years because I wasn't happy with our relationship or how we were as people - let alone a couple. I was in a terrible mental and physical place health wise already and things plummeted afterwards.

I was convinced I was an absolute asshole for breaking her heart and that I was unworthy of love again. I believed that I was responsible for ruining someone's life. In the process, I lost myself and ( due to other factors too) developed severe depression.

After a lot of therapy and support, I decided to focus my life on learning how to love myself and how to treat myself with some good ol' self compassion. Since then, I've built up my community, learned self-care, and come to peace with myself. I feel happy, present and whole.

Then suddenly, a few weeks ago during an overseas work trip, I met an amazing woman that has blown my mind. She's patient, passionate, resilient, and kind. Plus we share similar values and life goals too.

She's also great with kids and animals, treats her family and friends with generosity and respect, can hold up against me in an intellectual debate, is a massive geek, was military ( I love a woman in uniform!), and enjoys cooking.

I'm terrified of being hurt and hurting someone again. We live in different countries right now too. In my fear, my brain keeps conjuring up reasons why this will be doomed too or how it might just be infatuation. But she's patient with me and reassured me that she's there and we'll figure things out - that when I'm ready for a relationship, she's ready for us because she knows I'm ""worth it"".

 I don't know how the hell she hasn't been snatched up already but damn! She's wife material! I'm falling for her hard. Yes, I'm scared as hell but I know if I don't take a risk and try, I will regret this for life.

There's a saying that you'll find love when and where you least expect it. I think it happens when you start to accept and love yourself first. I'm happy. I already was before I met her, but now I have a bonus reason to be grateful and happy.",actuallesbians

So we (25 and 28) met on a dating app and hit it off on our first meeting, and have met up like 10 times since then.

We‚Äôve also both got depression but mines is more in remission right now but hers is very active.

However last time we were chatting, I asked her about where she sees this going and she says she sees no future between us but does like me and does like spending time with me. She‚Äôs off on vacation in a few weeks time so for now we‚Äôve agreed to carry on spending time.

She essentially told me that she did/does like me, and thinks I'm an awesome lady, but now's not the right time. Also that she really values our friendship (which is good, because she's actually a great friend), and doesn't want it to change or be awkward. So, like, that's the second most-preferable outcome.  


And also, I learned at the age of 24 that I, despite being a long-closeted Hoosier Queer^(TM ,) have decent gaydar and can indeed also ask women out without melting into a sludgy pool of anxiety.

[rant] Go make more friends.,"When I asked you out, you told me you wanted things to end well, you didn't want to lose your best friend.

When I asked you 2 years later, why you wouldn't talk to me about these important things that you avoided, you said the same thing. ""Remember? When you asked me, I said it..."" I didn't remember.

I didn't think of breakups that way. I shouldn't have to. But you were so selfish. You knew these questions were coming, but you'd tell me ""think about something else"" you'd tell me ""thinking about this makes me anxious"". But you're not this whole discussion. You're one half of this relationship. Why is it all about you? I asked why you wouldn't talk. ""I don't want to lose my best friend.""

And your friends... Why was it all about your friends? Really? You stood up for 3 days and then you skipped a nap to help your friend do her nails? But I know you couldn't put aside any more than an hour for me - and taking the subway would give me panic attacks all the time. It costs money to travel and you never visited me more than once.

You told me you didn't want to come back home, because there was nothing waiting for you back here. Who was over there that made you so enamored? Is it wrong of me to think that? You were never the same. Why did you drag it on so long?

I think you did exactly what you were trying not to.

Who was your best friend?

The only person you confide in?

The person you would talk to because you were feeling bad?

The person you'd only go to because you had bad news?

The person you'd didn't even remember was your girlfriend?

Who was your girlfriend?

The person you fucked sometimes?

The only trophy in your cabinet?

The puppy waiting at home?

Did she mean anything to you after that first year?

I really want to know.

I want to know if it was worth it.

Why did you tell me you were alone again? Why did I think it could lead to anything good? You were never adventurous, why would I even think you'd let that happen? I'm glad you didn't, but I'm also glad you decided to bring it back up a few hours later, so I could decide not to talk to you.

You're messing with my brain. You didn't deserve all the effort I put into things.

I know you're looking for me, but I'm tired of it. You need new friends. You need to fucking learn how to confide in people. How can that be so hard? You did things for them that you would never do for me. They might as well be your girlfriends. What do you mean you can't talk to them? That's what you spent all your time doing. Maybe you should be fucking them too.

I'm done letting you confide in me - go find someone else. I'm done trying to be friends after a breakup. We are not best friends. I forgot how nice it was to flirt. To have it reciprocated, rather than followed by an ""eww"" or a change of subject. I can't wait to have a partner that is mature, excited to see me, and goes out of their way to do that, like I wasted years doing for you. I have so much fun sexting girls now. It's weird how good it feels to have someone into me. There are random chicks that wanna fuck me, although it's not always easy to get in touch with them, but I'm getting more experience, and it's actually fun.

I daydreamed about driving a special ""her"" around. I don't know who, but she's out there. And she's going to listen to me sing along to my shitty music, and talk about how cute my new car is, but also about how I've been waiting all my life to drive her around town, and how she can visit my future condo whenever she wants, and that she can borrow my future kitten and take him home whenever she wants... And she can borrow me whenever she wants...

There's someone in my online friend group that seems to have a crush on me. And I guess I do too. We're both kind of ""useless"" but I could see myself falling for her, although she's very far. But who knows. It's nice to remember I'm likable, at least sometimes.

I guess after that, I'd still date a new bff, because I don't care about that word anymore. I have SO many best friends. So many people that I confide in. Not just the girl I wanna fuck. I don't use her for that, because I know it can become stressful if she's the only one bearing it, or if that's the only thing she hears from me.

...I muted your message thread, I guess I'm too scared to delete it. But I also pinned more than 10 other threads so I'd never see yours without making an effort to. I know you've wanted to get in touch, but I only have one update anyways.

I'm sorry that you lost your best friend.",actuallesbians

Do you experience attraction to women differently than you imagine straight men do?,"It's impossible to generalize what ALL straight men find attractive. Different people have different preferences, obviously. Plus, all of our beauty standards are rooted in our culture. 

Even so, wlw as a group tend to look and dress ""differently"" from straight women. We've got our own ways to try and clock other wlw in public (flannel shirts, short hair, beanies, you know the stereotypes). I wonder if a lot of what I find attractive in other women is based in what I *know* signifies queerness, or if wlw fashion evolved based around things women find attractive? 

In any case, I've always found broad shoulders and soft hips very attractive. Girls who look like they could thrive in the wilderness for months. The line from the chin to the ear to the neck to the shoulder. Dark hair and sly side-smiles.

I don't know much about what straight men like, and I reckon y'all don't either. But are there ways you're attracted to women that you think are more unique to wlw experiences?",actuallesbians

"My sister's birthday is coming up and she recently came out to me. However, she's still not comfortable acknowledging or talking about it since then. I'm looking for some gift guidance!","My younger sister is a sophomore in college and is currently at school far from home. She and I are very close. About a month ago she came out to me as gay. While I was happy for her and wanted to celebrate her coming out, she was very distraught and conflicted. I'm the only person in our family who knows. It killed me to see how much pain she has been in for most of her life having to hold in this part of who she is from everyone. I love her very much and want to be there for her to talk to but when I gently brought it up again to ask how she was feeling, she was clearly uncomfortable and said she did not want to talk about it. 

I respect that my sister will be ready to talk and be open in her own time and I'm not trying to push her. But I also feel strange just ignoring it and pretending nothing happened. I don't want to push my feelings on her or make it about me. It's just that I am heartbroken for her and I want her to feel accepted and loved. 

That's a very long intro to my real question about her birthday gift. Were there any books or pieces of pop culture that helped you in coming to terms and being proud of who you are? Anything that might subtly say I acknowledge and love this part of you?",actuallesbians

Plenty of Fail (a more recent adventure),"I clicked with an age appropriate, shorter, pretty type butch who is a  &gt;30 minute drive from me... We make the jump from POF to text, she is an iPhone user (thank the Lords Of Kobol), and though she struggled with my humor and had to do some Googling to get some of my references - it seemed to be going well enough.

We made plans to go for a casual dinner near her and she randomly mentioned ""if we're going to fuck afterwards it'll have to be in a car in the Kelseys parking lot because I'm housesitting for the night "".  Ummmm, okay? I wasn't planning on that AT ALL... but that's kinda sketchy. Why not in the empty house she's supposed to be sitting? 

Then she asks me to bring along a double ended dildo and is super excited she's on her period and we can have awesome period sex with toys ... IN A CAR. Hey cute strange chick? I'm into all that (minus the car thing kinda though.) But can we just have a burger maybe and then be super awkward and cute afterwards and then deal with the rest?

I bailed on her that evening, with plenty of notice. 

We keep texting for a week and she invites me out again, this time straight to the backseat. Then casually informs me she has a cracked kneecap and a large open wound on her knee that definitely should have been stitched and now may or may not be infected badly. BACKSEAT SEX IS JUST WHAT YOU NEED! NOTHING LIKE KNEELING ON SEAT BELT BUCKLE THINGYS WITH A BROKEN AND GANGRENOUS KNEE. 

I make excuses and suggest her place, but she's housesitting again. Maybe when she's not housesitting??? She doesn't know how long it'll be... It has to be the car, and for some reason the Kelseys parking lot specifically. And now, much to my chagrin, the burgers aren't even part of the offer. 

So yeah. This broad is toooooootally housesitting... For her wife / husband / parents... that are not away at all. For heavens sake just tell me you live with whoever and can't bring people home. 

And now I'm supposed to just waltz over there into her car and have toy sex right off the bat in a car without even an appetizer or beverage beforehand to steel me for the festering knee problems in the car that MUST be parked in the Kelseys parking lot. 

Online dating is awesome.

This is bad...,"I‚Äôve been reading posts on here for a while, but now I ‚Äúfinally‚Äù have something to talk to you about, and I need an advIce and I need someone to tell me ill be fine... Warning: I‚Äôm useless... and I feel like shit.

So I have this friend (known each other since middle school) and I always wanted to be around her and I really, really wanted her to like me. Took me just unter 7 years to realise that it was not friendship I was looking for... I came out rather late (was 20), friends and family were ok with it (lucky me üôåüèª) and she was the one that made me realise I was gay. Just for context: I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, never kissed someone apart from dares at parties so: no experience...

Fast forward 5 years and we have last weekend. She came to visit me (we live about 5 hours apart) and on the last evening we were watching a movie on the couch, one of my favourites in fact. As always she is leaned up against me. I‚Äôve never quite lost the fascination with her although she has a boyfriend and identifies as straight.

When the movie is over we stay up and talk, then I tell her I‚Äôll go to bed next door. So I do exactly that and fall asleep. Must be about half an hour later that she knocks on my door and asks if she could come in. She said she wanted to keep talking. I said ok and she came in and slipped under the covers. I mean we‚Äôve always need close but this was new to me... she cuddles up, we talk and just before I fall asleep, she kisses me cheek. And suddenly I am wide awake and she kisses me on the lips. No tongue, nothing, but the closest thing to a romantic encounter I‚Äôve ever had.

We cuddled and kissed all night and the next day, I took her to the train station. I am nervous, thinking what happe ed the nicht before but teying to play it cool (yeah, kike that was go ne work...) We talk just like we always do and shortly before I can drop her off and she gets out of my car, she looks at me and tells me how much she enjoyed the previous evening and that she liked kissing me. She leans over, kisses me again and then leaves my car.

Now I‚Äôm sitting at home feeling like an idiot, because now she‚Äôs back with her boyfriend in their apartment and I‚Äôm sitting here all stupid and crushing on her worse than ever before...

dating the most perfect girl in the world but ive developed a crush¬ø,"(ive posted this in other subreddit but i figured i could use all the help i could get)


my girlfriend is beautiful and loving and everything you could ask for, we‚Äôve been dating for around 1 1/2 years and she‚Äôs been my best friend for 2.

but recently this new girl‚Äôs got me fuckedd up. she‚Äôs in some of my classes and my girl‚Äôs in none so recently there has been some distance between the two of us but nothing too much, ive been calling and facetiming her almost everyday.

this new girl ive known for a few days and at first i just wanted to be friends but recently one of my friends told me she was bi and that‚Äôs what really got me fucked. i don‚Äôt think i would be this interested in the girl if i didn‚Äôt know she was gay. ive caught myself staring at her a bunch and she‚Äôs noticed too, i would say we r ok friends but we don‚Äôt really know each other too well.

so, what the fuck do i do? obviously i don‚Äôt wanna cheat on my girl or break it up. do i just wait for this crush/infatuation to pass? am i an asshole or disloyal for feeling this way? i don‚Äôt wanna just distance myself completely from this girl until my feelings disappear because she really is chill and i wanna be her friend but if that‚Äôs really what it takes i will. should i tell my girlfriend about this?? i don‚Äôt feel like it would help anyone but is that the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô thing to do?

Ghosted...and then found?,"Back in early July I matched with a woman on Tinder. We talked like every day for a straight week. We shared so much and there was so much mutual interest in what the other was saying that I was kind of blown away. We talked about meeting up, but then her last message was shorter than the rest, and that was the last I heard from her. 

I stopped using tinder a bit after that. Before I turned my profile off, I sent her another message with my number. 

Then a few minutes ago I got a Tinder notification that I had messages. I was kind of confused because i only had one active mutual match, with the aforementioned woman. 

So I click her picture and there are two messages from her. Apparently she sent them Sunday but I was only notified today. I've thought about her a lot since we last spoke. I'd never connected with someone like I seemed to with her. 

Here's what she wrote:

""Dear Lorna, I have been trying to find a way to write this in a sensitive way. I adored speaking with you and I apologize for my disappearing act. I will say it was a mixture of fear and uncertainty. I'm genuinely a tentative person but I shared more than I thought with you or anyone in a long time. You seemed to like me so much it was scary. Not that I'm low in self esteem or image but like it be too good to be true. It had nothing to do with you being trans hence trying to write this in a way that I was being a coward. I did get the postal service and it's hard I still have little time to myself but it's daylight hours and I'm happy. I used up my savings to make the transition between jobs so a meeting wouldn't happen too soon if it was still on the table. Which it might not be because I said nothing for so long. Break of trust and all. I hope you got the Nutrosystem job or something that will make you happy. If you get this since you gave me your cell here's mine (xxx)xxx-xxxx.

If you want to chat again or eventually like to meet. But I understand if not because silence seemed easier than continuing and that's on me not anyone else. A stranger's apology must not seem like much but it's all I have. Today seems as if August is lashing it's fury out at it's end that though September has begun the chill of autumn may not come.""

I'm in loooove. Just wanna share. Please be happy for me lol,"Sorry. I just wanna express how happy and in love I am. lol English is not my first language. Please bear with me. Thanks.... And so it goes.

Two months ago I met the most amazing woman on Tinder. I don't usually stay up all night just to talk to strangers, and yet I felt special when I talked to her until the wee hours of the morning. I felt sooooo comfortable with her. After two weeks, we met at a local cafe. She's so beautiful, intelligent, and funny. I was smitten because of they way she talks and expresses things. She's has a sentimental ass like me. She smokes and drinks alcohol toooo! I'm fond of the the stuff she likes. We have so much in common and we're both femmes. WE HIT IT OFF! We've seen each other for a couple times. She slept at my apartment. Nothing happened tho. Just kissed and cuddled. Goood, you know how I respect her so bad as much as I wanted to fuck the brains out of her. Ahhhhh. 
Days went by and things did go very well. I went out with her friends. She went out with mine and so on. Happy times.

Aaaaaand, just a week ago, she became my girlfriend. Fun Fact: This is my first legit and official relationship with a woman! I couldn't be more happy! Please be happy for me hahahah i sound pathetic. Forgive me.

Yayyyy. I'm not a useless lesbian anymore. I've had flings and hook-ups with other women before whom I haven't seen any future with. But, I've never been so sure of her in just a short period of time. I felt that I was ready for her. I've never been so open, so expressive with my feelings towards a person. I'm tired of games that I used to play before. I'm now 23 and I don't want to fool around. I want to spend more of my time with my girlfriend. I love her so much and I'm so attached. Godddamit.

Dating rant..sorry for the length. Any advice would be great,"So I met this lesbian on Tinder..I know maybe not the best place. It was pretty nuts the connection we had. We liked almost all the same things, such as poetry and weird crime stories. Really, we could talk about anything and she said alot of shit to me, such as I told my mom about you, I care, etc. I told her a lot of stuff too. I opened up about my past and mistakes I made and she did the same. Things got really intense and we started even sending naked photos to each other and sending long sexual explicit messages. We had a really intense sexual attraction to. She made a plan to meet me, put an exact date and everything. But one day she randomly ghosted me after I was talking about how I like to cook Spanish food. It was so random. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering if it has something to do with her past. She hasn't dated in seven years and she revealed she was cheated on before. She mentioned I was kinda the first person she was dating in that time frame. She was sort of a player and besides that had a fucked past (adopted, abused by adopted mother, etc.). I also am wondering if maybe it has something to do with the fact I am bisexual, broke as fuck and live with my ex gf due to it. She had a bisexual ex who cheated on her with a man as well and maybe I remind her of that ex? I just don't completely understand why she ghosted me because she said I won't leave you and she was talking about how she is looking for a life partner. She left this poem on her fb talking about a broken heart, never feeling like this before, how it was too fast and how only time can tell. I messaged her that I care and if she needs to talk she can when she is ready. It's been a week since then. I have no idea if she will reach out again. Any thoughts?",actuallesbians

Well I finally got around to having a conversation with her about why we weren‚Äôt having sex. It turns out both of us were kind of waiting for the other to initiate and we‚Äôre actually on the same page as far as wanting more. I suppose some of it is that both of us are used to someone else taking charge (in previous relationships).

How do I ask out my trainer?,"There‚Äôs this girl that I‚Äôve been quietly into for about 4 months. She‚Äôs a running coach at the gym I go to. Figured out the other day that she‚Äôs definitely a lesbian. We definitely know each other in passing, but I‚Äôve always rushed off after her classes or training sessions because of work or other social obligations. 
I followed her on Instagram a while ago, and after finding out she was into women I finally messaged her today complimenting an outfit she posted about. She responded super positively and said that she was glad we connected on Instagram and followed me back. 
Now- there‚Äôs absolutely no way of knowing that I‚Äôm into girls based on my instagram/our very very limited interactions with each other. Is is off base to ask her out upfront and just suggest we go out? I‚Äôve truly never been the one to ask out a woman- I can be painfully shy. I really admire her on so many levels. I am stuck on the fear of ultimately being weird around her or having to dodge corners out of embarrassment- but I guess that‚Äôs just part of it. 
I don‚Äôt want to make it weird as I absolutely love the gym that she works at, and her being a trainer definitely puts her at a ‚Äúhigher status.‚Äù 
Is there any subtle way to ask her out that is low stakes, but also let‚Äôs her know that I don‚Äôt mean as just friends?",actuallesbians

I feel like gay men don't like me?,"So I recently came to the realization that gay men probably don't like me and I don't know why? I'm a queer/ gay woman and in the past I've had gay men ""friends"" but I could always sense a tension between us and I always felt that our friendship wasn't genuine or one that would not last.  Even now, whenever I interact with a gay man, I feel like I am constantly being judged. This has happened so many times. 

Today for example,  I was looking at my fb and noticed that 2 gay men that I thought I was ""friends""  with( one of them I met studying abroad and we hung out  A LOT in the past, and the other was a co-worker that I used to also hang out with a lot too  we took a class together and also have a bunch of mutual friends)  unfriended me.   


So I am wondering, has anyone else felt this way?  Is it all in my head  and correlation doesn't equal causation? or is it that, to some extent, the stereotype that gay men and lesbians don't get a long is true? ",actuallesbians

I'm going to ask her out tomorrow.,"It's been stressing me out since school started last week. I'd kinda known her for a few months and I felt like as soon as she saw me, she liked me. I have a tendency to be attracted to people who I think like me, but when I find out they don't like me, I'm not attracted to them anymore. I went on this whole mental journey all summer trying to figure out if I like this person. The more I interacted with them, the more I felt they liked me. It's body language, the way she laughs at my (trash) jokes, etc. I've seen pictures of people she's attracted to on Twitter and almost all of them look EXACTLY like me.

My main problem is figuring out if I do actually like them, which I think I solidified that I do a few days ago. I get the same physical reactions when I see her as I do with someone I'm attracted to, so I'm pretty sure I like her. She does a lot of things that aren't attractive to me, but that's not their fault. Most of the time, I can't tell if they're being themselves or if they're performing, like they're acting how they think they should act.

Another thing is I'm a very reserved person and I don't think she is and that worries me. I'm worried that I won't be able to handle how openly sexual she is, or if she won't like how reserved I am. Like I don't want to hold her back or anything. I'm reserved because of trauma that happened to me that she knows about, so I'm sure she's understanding, but I still worry.

I have no idea if I'm demisexual or just traumatized. I'm trying to get therapy but it's a little complicated because of financial dependency and all that. I posted here last year about a girl and someone said, ""Make sure you're physically attracted to her, because if not, don't date her."" The problem is, I'm not sure if I've ever been physically attracted to anyone. Maybe, I'm not sure. Again, I don't know if I'm demisexual or too afraid to feel my emotions because of trauma.

Another thing is that I don't know how to flirt, or at least my way of flirting doesn't seem like flirting to other people unless they've known me for a long time. Like I said, I'm very reserved. I try my best to flirt back and I'm proud when I do because it's really hard for me, but I realized, from someone else I dated for a week, that it isn't clear that I'm flirting. It just seems like I'm acting normal.

Idk this whole situation is stressing me out. A friend recommended to just tell her what's going on so that she's in the loop and doesn't hopefully feel like she's being lead on. So that's what I'm going to do tomorrow. I set out a whole plan about how I was going to ask her out in about a week or two from now, but this is stressing me so much that I'm not eating nearly as much as I should.

I WANT to date her, even though I'm a little worried that we don't ""click."" I don't know how it's supposed to go because the one person I dated for a week was the first person I dated and that was last year. I'm 21 now, so I feel like I'm really late to this whole dating thing, but I know a lot of people don't date for a while. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do other than be a friend but more intimate. They don't teach you what you're ""supposed"" to do when you're dating someone!

asdfghjkl I'm trying, yall. I'm trying not to be useless. I'll update yall when I tell her what's going on with me. Idk if I'm technically asking her out, but I'm just gonna tell her how I'm feeling. I hope it goes well.",actuallesbians

"Hi fellow raptors, I need some help!","I‚Äôve decided to post this here instead of posting it in a male dominated talk thread, as you all may be able to sympathize with this a lot more (I also just discovered this sub yesterday, yay!) 

I am a 23 year old, recent grad who has never been in a relationship. I‚Äôve never been kissed even and am so greatly inexperienced. I have this huge fear because of that inexperience any potential partner I meet will ***not*** want to deal with that. Which makes me feel like I‚Äôve missed the boat, as I am only getting older. I also live in a rural area, am financially dependent upon my helicopter parents until I find a job (which is so damn painful). 

Now, let me tell you more about my parents. They‚Äôre both pretty left leaning but I am not sure if that applies to their daughter too, as I am also still in the closet. My fear about coming out is mostly directed at my mom, she has her own vision of how my life should go, marry a man, a couple kids and probably become a housewife like her. I am too petrified as this point to even think of opening up to her about my sexuality at the fear of blowing up so many preconceived notions she has for me. I personally want to wait until I move out and become financially independent. 

I‚Äôm a bit frazzled right now because I feel once I move out and am finally independent of them I‚Äôll be too old in a potential partner‚Äôs mind to deal with as I am a hardcore virgin to relationships as well as in the bedroom.

Would you date someone with very-inconvenient-but-usually-not-too-serious illnesses?,"You meet a girl. You go on a few dates, you're attracted to her, and then you discover she's not as healthy as you thought. Let's say she's got PCOS and celiac disease. Both of which require her to keep on a strict diet, and rarely can she eat out at restaurants, your place, or friends' and families' places because of the risk of gluten cross-contamination (unlike the people who go gluten-free as a fad diet, people who have celiac disease can end up hospitalized if they ingest so much as a crumb of regular bread). So basically eating at her place, having a picnic, or bringing her own food to wherever she's going are the only options... And due to the PCOS, she might have trouble getting pregnant (or donating eggs to a partner) in the future, plus she has bouts of acne -- occasionally pretty bad acne.

Dreams,"I want to be in a healthy poly relationship that allows me to do all that i want while letting my partners do what they want. 

I want to let my boyfriend continue working his dream job while I satisfy my wanderlust. 

I crave a safe place, deep in the woods, hard to find, and not a map. Somewhere I can go when I want to be alone, where I can have romantic rendezvous with my partners, where I can find myself one with nature once again. 

I want to plant willow trees and lay under their branches. 
  
I want a garden with flowers, fruits, herbs, and everything in between. 

I'd like to find someone as passionate as me and we can go save animals and raise awareness. 

I don't want to go college or reach other people's aspirations. I just want to write stories, watch movies, and listen to the rain. 

I want to get my strength back and put my body back on track. With my chronic illness it's hard to find people that understand and are patient. 

I want to collect anything that makes my heart happy and not worry about the costs. Anything from (smoking) glass to enamel pins. I'm always up for a conversation on that. My collections now seem so measly. 

I'd like to have a partner who wants to travel almost as much as me. Who'd love living in a camper we created for a week or two. Someone who enjoys the solitude of nature and our garden. 

I wish I could make enough money to afford more than one residency. 

I ache for good ole fashion attention; dancing together while the pie bakes, resting on each other while a movie plays, taking naps on a rainy day, playing board games because there's nothing good on tv, taking walks along the river and talking about the universe...I guess I could go on and on. 

Sometimes I wish I could start a cult just so I could see the good in people consistently. I want to have a family I can trust and depend on. I've been taking care of myself since I can remember, I'm tired. 

I want my big, giant, cozy bed to live in an alcove of soft fabric and fairy lights. 

I refuse to leave this world without building a house. It will be created in a way that benefits humans and their furry companions.

"Recently realized I might not be straight, not sure what to do?","Background info:

I have been in a long-term relationship with a man for the past four years. He's the only man I've ever found attractive, and I just kind of ignored that fact until recently.

I wasn't very sexual, and somewhat recently I realized that all of fantasies I did have were where I was basically imagining it from the perspective of the man (I am not confused about my gender though) ans was always focusing on imagining the women naked.

Then I started noticing that I often involuntarily check women out, and I find that in order to have an orgasm with my boyfriend, I have to imagine a scenario where I am with a woman. Sometimes when we are kissing, I have gotten so into the fantasy that I have involuntarily gone to feel up my boyfriend's non-existent breasts and had to awkwardly cover for it.

Then I remembered that when I was younger, like toddler to kindergarten age, I would try to kiss all of my friends who were girls and when I was in elementary school I was often trying to get attention from the female teachers and TAs. I have also occasionally been jealous of my best friend getting a boyfriend, though I didn't think twice about why...

I enjoy being with my boyfriend and have enjoyed sexual activites with him in the past, but I have never found a different man attractive and never check them out whereas I feel a sort of weird, almost ashamed feeling when I see a woman. It's like a warmth rushing over me and I feel like I need to look away. I feel like I have a visceral reaction to their body shape whereas men, besides my boyfriend, don't do much for me. I find the male physique generally boring, but also am not generally interested in sex.

I don't consume much porn, but all of the porn I do look at is just naked women, and I generally just find myself very drawn to other women, but it could also just be a desire for a close friendship. I don't know.

Am I gay, or could I be bisexual maybe even straight? How do I know for sure?

How to chat up women as a woman and is it really that terrible that I'm bi?,"I'm positive that this has been asked a million times, and I did search for it, but the terms I used didn't pull up much.

I knew I was into women when I was 16. I had a really close female friend that I loved in a different way than I loved my other lady friends. I also knew she wasn't into women at all, and I was growing up in the rural south, so I shoved all that into the shit to deal with later box. 

Well, it's later. And I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm in a poly relationship, and would very much like to learn how to navigate the field as a woman interested in women. 

I feel like a lot of the flirting I do could be easily confused as things women just do. Obviously there's no I'm into women bat signal (of there is please tell me), but after a lifetime of non-participation I'm not really sure where to start. Most of my flirting could easily be interpreted as just things women do, and I don't want to end up with lesbian sheep syndrome. But I also don't want to shoot a good friendship in the foot because I was weird.

Another worry is that my only current long term partner is a man. I've heard a lot about how strictly lesbian women are against dating women in relationships with men. I get it, on dating sites I see so many people looking for someone to ""spice up their relationship.""

I went to a social event last night and there was a woman there that I got along with well and this morning I realised that I was thinking about her the whole drive home and I‚Äôm so annoyed and disappointed in myself because I think I may be attracted to her and I‚Äôm worried if I see her more at future events is may become a full-on crush

What can I do to make sure that I never feel that way for her as the only thing I can think of is avoiding her which means avoiding those social events which are half my socialising as it is so I don‚Äôt want to loose that

i'm scared,"I'm 18year old girl and im dating a boy, and for a couple of months i've been more or less anxious bc ive started questioning my sexuality. I've identified as bi since i was about 14 even tho i didnt really experience any sexual attraction to girls or boys, i just felt that i could fall in love with both. When i actually started experiencing sexual attraction, it was mostly toward girls but i was still pretty curious about boys and they made me feel pretty strongly unlike girls, who i didnt seem to be interested outside of my fantasies. Later on I started experiencing sexual attraction towards men too, at least i thought i did? Seeing men naked or something doesnt do a lot for me, it looks nice and i feel a little something but actually being with them (or at least with my boyfriend) is great and feels nice.
Everything was p okay until i started reading about compulsory heterosexuality, and now it has become kind of like an obsession of mine. I'm constantly checking if im actually attracted to my boyfriend or if im just faking it, i'm scared i'm faking it and not even noticing it or that i'm in denial about it. This anxiety almost made me broke up with my boyfriend and i dont wanna go thru that ever again bc i truly feel like i love my boyfriend, i just dont know that what kind of love it is anymore. I've gone thru my childhood and if i have been attracted to anyone and are they girls or boys or what. I realised i didnt have a lot of crushes on anyone growing up, but i did have some sexual thoughts about women as a child, which i didnt have of men. 

I'm just really freaking out, I dont want to lose my boyfriend, but i dont know what to do. I'm afraid that if I'm gay I'd have to  break up with him. And I'm sorry if this doesnt belonghere but i just thought if someone who used to be in my situation could tell how they knew their attraction was real or wasnt. ",actuallesbians
How long does it take you to get over a crush?,"I spent a month working on a farm (which was a great experience btw) and met this girl which I ended up intensely crushing on over the few weeks I spent getting to know her. Even though she said she was straight I could swear there was some chemistry going on between us that was not just one sided. Those deep intense stares and light touching I really ended up falling hard. Like the useless lesbian I am, I never did anything about it and there is probably no chance that I will ever see her again. 

That was 2 months ago and I am still thinking about her everyday. Even though I go out with friends and try to chat to new people I am really struggling to get her out of my head. There was this crazy chemical charge between us and its rare for me to find that connection.

Do you also feel that LGTB women love other women more than men do?,"I have embraced my bisexuality a couple of months ago and I feel like, for the first time in my life, I do not have to worry so much about my growing hair or stretch marks or that pair of panties... And I also do not care at all about those things on any other girl.

Actually, I love all these ""ugly"" things! All these little things that we are bombarded everyday on ads that we have to remove or change. I feel like we have been taught all our lives to love men's hair and suddenly, yeah, I actually love it in women too! I love every single part of them.

I now don't get most of the stigma that patriarchy lays on us and seems to me that LGTB women do love women way more than straight men do.

Did this happen for anyone else?,"When I was 7 my mom got a job working as a bartender, every bartender was a gay woman except my mother. Whenever I had the chance I would ask my dad to take me there to see her and so we could have dinner there as well. 

I loved all of those women because they were all so nice and caring.

Well I came out a year and a half ago and my mother was perfectly fine with it, in fact she had known since I was 4. After I came out she started to tell me all the things that her co-workers would tell her: ""your daughter's gay ya know?"", ""tell me when she comes out."" ect. She always had the nicest responses. One time a customer asked why she was okay with what they were saying, her response was ""that's my little girl, so what if she likes other girls, that doesn't change who she is because she will always be my little girl."" 

Imagine how confused she was when I told her I had a ""boyfriend"", we were ""together"" for a year before I came out. I put those 2 words in quotes because the most ""couple"" like thing we did was hold hands. 

But my question is, did anyone else have a gay/lesbian person in their life that may have helped your parents realize that being gay is just how some people are and that there is nothing wrong with it?

To my first love,"You came and moved your seat all the way from across the room to sit next to me in French class. I didn't really think much of it because I'm actually oblivious to everything. Then one day, I saw you were upset about your class and comforted you. I helped you with your French and I talked about my birthday. You asked me for my number and we hung out at a cozy cafe and at the beach. I still remember when I picked you up in my car. You asked me if we could hang out on Valentine's Day. I said ok. I didn't have any other plans so why not? (useless lesbian) You ran to my door with the dorkiest smile on your face and a handful on my favorite flowers, red carnations. I loved carnations because they remind me of my late great-grandmother. We went on a huge adventure downtown, meeting so many people, blasting music down the highway at night and forgetting about all of pain and problems. That Valentine's was probably the best day of my life. You came back to my apartment that night and confessed your feelings for me. Maybe I should have rejected you that night, knowing I was going to lose you. But I confessed my feelings for you too. We spent that night on the floor coloring and listening to Courtney Barnett. Later in the year, we had our first kiss, made love and drove across the state together going on adventures. I realized that true love means loving the parts that aren't the best and forgiving one another and being compassionate. We were too young and both had trauma from our past that caused us pain. It was too short. When you left my apartment for the last time, I felt so empty. When I saw you for the last time at the cafe we previously went on so many dates to, you looked so cold. You told me you were moving that Friday. I think the relationship was too much for us. We rushed it. I'm trying to heal and I love being single, but I can't help and think about you. I'm forever grateful for you and I wish you the best. Je t'aime.",actuallesbians
If I could have chosen...,"Hello.

I love Against Me! and am inspired by LJG's music and visibility as a trans gal myself.

Favourite song of theirs is The Ocean and the following is my version of that really good song: let the music serve you.

If I could have chosen, where god would hide his heaven,


I would wish for it to be in the salt and swell of the ocean
Carried by the currents to all continents' shores


Reaching into depths where the sun‚Äôs light has never shown
Mixed with algae and coral,


Breathed in by sharks and dolphins
Sailed by tanker ships, private yachts, swam in by a Taurus
Working its way up through inlets, lakes, and rivers, swamps, and estuaries
Down through limestone into the aquifer
Purified by the county, pumped through pipes and out faucets
Filled into a glass to meet the thirst of our children.


If I could have chosen, I would have been born a woman
My mother once told me she would have named me Laura
I would grow up to be strong and beautiful like her,
One day, I‚Äôd find an honest woman to make my wife...

We would have two children, build our home on the mountains of Canada
Our family would spend cold winter days in the snow together...


The snow would get stuck in her hair as we built snowmen and made dreams and
we would know we loved each other without having to say it,

At night, we would sleep roasting by an open fire
Letting the cool Canadian air soothe the distance between us.

There is an ocean in my soul where the waters do not curve.

Thank you.

Considering slowly coming out,"A few days ago I posted here about how scared I am to come out. ...while that still stands, I'm at least going to try to start the process. I just like this girl too much to let my own closetedness push her away. Last night I mustered up the courage to hold her hand while I was driving and her friend was in the back seat. I figured there's no point in hiding my affection since he's a close friend of hers and already knows that something is going on between us. She bought me a hamburger so I got bold enough to give her a kiss for it. 

She text me later that night saying that I was brave. She knows how hard it is for me to even think about coming out, so that meant a lot. I'm going to try getting comfortable in front of her close friends, then my close friends, and see where it goes from there. It'll take some time.

LDR girlfriend becoming super close to someone who has a crush on her,"Hello, 

I'm going through rough times in my LDR, &amp; am really hoping for words of advice.

My gf (X) lives in the u.s and I live in the uk. We have been together nearly a year, and are working twds closing the gap in January. 

Since Feb, X has become a lot closer to a friend (Y) - someone she considered dating before she met me. They text and hang out a lot, and a few months ago, X admitted that Y most probably has a crush on her. The issue was skimmed over and they continue to become closer. 

Every time I bring up the crush it ends in an argument, which drives me and X further apart. I really loathe feelings of jealousy but I can't help but wonder if I do have something to feel weird about, given the context.

We talked again about everything, we drank a lot, I prepared a dinner, we smoked a lot, we vaporized, we fucked a lot, a lot, a lot. I lied at work and I just missed it to stay with her.

Why do girls offer their numbers and not reply?,"(A bit of a long post, sorry :/) 

TLDR: Met this girl. She indirectly approached me multiple times. Then offers me her number but does not reply. So what's the point? Someone explain this mind game LOL

So I met this girl at an edm festival this weekend. Initially, my friend (male) and I were dancing (very platonically) towards the front of the main stage. Upon the beat dropping, a girl subtly joins me while her friends were dancing near us. I thought she was pretty cute but didn't think much of it and went back to doing my own thing. She stepped back to dance with her friends while, I remained where I was originally with my other friend next to me. I was a bit intoxicated but I noticed she would indirectly try to get my attention by showing up and dancing closer to me while my friend and I were dancing (friend and i were dancing apart from each other so there were no romantic vibes.) So, she does this the first time and then introduces herself. Ok, whatever. Then does this 2 MORE TIMES, then asks where my friends were (maybe to see if the guy I was with was my boyfriend?). Second time, we ended up trading bracelets (it's a rave thing). 

I decided I wanted to try my luck and confirm my suspicions of her because who knows , maybe this girl is being friendly and I'm getting the wrong idea. I stood behind her, leaned closer and eventually had my hands kind of close to her waist (where you would feel that someone's about to touch you but I'm not actually touching her). She leans closer as well and puts her hands on my wrists, to place on her waist but I misinterpreted that as her not being comfortable and trying to take my hands off her. LOL stupid drunk self didn't process it correctly. Anyway, I pulled away from her because I didn't think she was cool with it. 

After more dancing, her friends finally signaled her to leave because they wanted to go. So, she was in a position where she was standing next to me but didn't move for a bit. I decided to break the silence and ask, ""Oh, do you have to go?"" She's like, ""Yeah.."" Then out of no where, she casually offers me her number, ""Oh, here's my number."" I didn't even expect it. I thought she was just going to say goodbye and that was that. LOL my friend decides to swoop in and say, ""I'll take your number."" and I'm like ""No, don't give it to him. He's just being thirsty."" So I continued the conversation by asking if she'll be here at the same venue tomorrow and whatnot when she wrote her number down on my phone. Then, we said our goodbyes. 

The next day, I texted her - ""Hey \_\_\_ , It's \_\_\_\_ . It was nice meeting you yesterday. I'll be at \_\_\_ at X time. Let me know if you wanted to meet up!"" Ya know, plain, simple and the ball is totally in her court, yes or no type of answer. 

Unfortunately, **she didn't reply** but I just left it at that and did not send another text. I also don't believe in coming off too strong or desperate. Maybe, she drunkenly gave me her number but she definitely seemed more sober than I was - gauging on her mannerisms and gestures. Another note is that I called her so she'd have my number too when she wrote down her number on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not understand why girls would offer their number and not reply. It's so pointless and feels like such a waste of time. Anyway, thoughts on this situation ? Have you done something similar, if so, why? - like actually offering your number and then ignoring the person cause I understand why girls just give out their numbers when asked.

lesbian? bi?? straIGHT??!????,"ok so. basically for a good year now i‚Äôve id‚Äôd as a lesbian and that‚Äôs been all fine and dandy. there were two years before that where i id‚Äôd as bi. i‚Äôve had (limited) experiences w both men &amp; women.

i thought i was a lesbian cause i read up on comp het and it seemed to tick all the boxes (men seem alright in fantasy but irl it‚Äôs a bit..... meh). i‚Äôve engaged in the wlw community and honestly it seemed to be going SWELL but now i‚Äôm panicking

men don‚Äôt catch my eye. ever. and like when i talk to them i get a bit nervous/fluttery i guess but i figured that was just cause they‚Äôre new people. any time they would show interest in me i would immediately try and shut it down (this is back when i id as bi). whereas girls i look at a lot and notice their bodies and stuff. except now i‚Äôm panicking that it‚Äôs only because of aesthetic appeal.

i think i‚Äôm p super in love w my best friend but idk. that‚Äôs a post for another day. but the reason i bring this up is that i think about her a lot and usually i just kind of want to fall into her and kiss her stupid face blah blah. but also i think that another friend has feelings for ME and whenever i get those vibes i get. super uncomfortable. i thought it was cause i don‚Äôt like her like that but now i‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a GIRL

anyway the reason this is all fucking with my head is p tmi so read on only if ur ok with that. basically i was getting myself off as u do after a long day &amp; nothing was really getting me going so out of the blue i conjured up a bit of chris hemsworth and my body just. went nuts. like. niagara falls. and anyway now i‚Äôm panicked that i‚Äôm actually straight/attracted to men and i just convinced myself i was a lesbian to feel different or be special or because my subconscious thought it was more ‚Äòon brand‚Äô for me. and i don‚Äôt NOT want to be a lesbian because then i feel like i‚Äôm supporting stereotypes that it‚Äôs just a phase and also i already came out to a bunch of ppl &amp; basically i just wanna know if i can test this somehow. like is there an online quiz ?????? or can some bi girls/lesbians tell me how they feel when they‚Äôre attracted to someone??? do i just have to go date a bunch of people and see what feels right ??????????

this is a really dumb post and i probably am a lesbian but i would appreciate some advice all the same

experience w a woman: amazing. fireworks. or in hindsight at least. think i was too shocked to fully process at the time

Girls are so much better to kiss than guys‚Äù etc. and I was like oh that‚Äôs sweet thank you. Then another of them misheard how much information was revealed and was like ‚Äúare you talking about how we all want to hook up with you?‚Äù 

I was like uhhhh WHAT 

They explained that they were all talking about how much they wanted to hook up with me and I was like ‚Äúyou guys are being the stereotype of drunk straight girls rn‚Äù and they were like nooo we were talking about this before we drank! And they kept fuckin talking about it they were like ‚Äúoh yeah we were telling our Lyft driver on the way over here that there‚Äôs this really cute girl there that we all want to hook up with!‚Äù 

Then they kept asking whether or not I would hook up with them all and I kept saying that I couldn‚Äôt answer the question because they‚Äôre my COWORKERS but I was finally like okay yeah I‚Äôd hook up with all three of you (bc tbh they‚Äôre all hotties) and then they TRIED STARTING A GAME OF SPIN THE BOTTLE!!!!!! 

I didn‚Äôt let it happen because 1) they‚Äôre my coworkers and 2) I‚Äôm very weary of hooking up with straight girls even though that seems kind of fun lol

My ego was definitely boosted to say the least, even though I didn‚Äôt let anything happen. Should I fall for the trap? There‚Äôs another party at a coworkers‚Äô house next weekend........ 

Also the best part is that one of my male coworkers was trying to swoop on one of the girls but he spent the whole night watching them fawn all over me ",actuallesbians
"My sister hooked me up with her friend i've had a crush on for years last night for my birthday, i'm confused, crushing hard, and I need to vent.","Alrighty so, lets begin.

Me and my sister are real close, talk about all our trouble and all that, we are tight. She grew to be a bit more social than I, I can count my friends on my fingers, if my hands were mangled and I only had 3 fingers.

She has one friend though, Irene and I've crushed on her since we were all freshmen in highschool, she is gorgeous and what not and she fits the ""Big tiddy goth gf "" trope, ect.. which is the type of stuff im attracted to, my sister knows this, and i've said crude things about her like, I wish she'd sit on my face you know dumb stuff, but one conversation I let it slip that I like her feet, and that they are cute, which brings us to the next part.

For my party it was just me, (She brought her friends) Her and Irene, we went swimming, did all the usual for half assed parties, i'm not too into celebrating, and no alcohol at all was consumed.

So now we get to the end of the night, it's just us two at my sisters house, I live with her since we moved out of our parents house, they help with rent ect.

Regardless we are watching it follows, i'm sitting next to my sister and Irene next to her, when my sister blurts out ""take your feet off the counter, your giving her (me) a free show"" 
To my absolute fucking horror, I shot my sister a DEATH glare and she just winks at me. I am so fucking grateful it was dark because I was probably as red as a tomato.

Anyways my sister keeps saying stuff like that all night and Irene would just sarcastically respond to them, until my sister says that i'm really good at foot massages, and that I could give Irene one, to which she agree'd and layed her feet across both of us and onto my lap. 

So at this point I am dying inside, I am not the type of girl who is outgoing, if my sister has friends over I will not leave my room because i'm either shy or have social anxiety, so not only do I have the CRUSH of my life doing something that up until this point I can only fantasize of I can't even bring myself to do it, until she starts begging and I finally do.

So we continue to watch the movie, and at this point i'm just feeling them and not really massaging them with her staring at me the entire time, and I have no clue what to look at so I awkwardly just look around like a moron, and try to hide my embarrassment in the fact that my sister is literally in the room with us.

When my sister left a moment to use the bathroom, she scooted over to my side and asked me if I was okay and I said yeah, and she told me that what I was doing felt really good, and that she hasn't met many girls who are into feet, then asks me if she can touch me, to which I say okay, and at this moment I can feel my heart throbbing in my throat, my ears feel like they are going to explode and there is a clicking in my chest, and then she just started rubbing me down there, my sister came back, and continued watching the movie and told me to be as loud as I want (wtf?) 

Anyways I can barely even feel it i'm so nervous, this is the FIRST time i've touched a girl let alone been this far, and she took pj's off and my panties and at this point i'm basically a blob of jello, when she just starts going down on me, and I must have sounded like an idiot because my sister kept saying ""easy easy its her first time"" because I was REALLY feeling it at this point, and just kept staring, and said in a joking manner that it was fortunate I shaved because I had a really cute vagina.

Anyways, I came she got up and resumed her old position with her feet on my lap, she told me to kiss them and I did for the remainder of the movie.

So yes, i'm still shaking, I cried afterwards when everyone was asleep not because I didn't want it but, because I don't know. My sister just watched me have sex, my crush just had sex with me, but I feel like it was out of pity maybe. I'm not ugly, but I am not in the same league as this girl, i'm nowhere even close. I'm just waiting for her to wake up so I can talk to her about it. but i'm not even sure it's a good idea.. I'm not a virgin anymore but i'm confused about it. Was this bad? also i'm sorry if this sounds like a cheap porno, but it's not. Nothing super glamorous happened I was the only one with clothing gone and I only lasted around 1 minute.

Is this internalised homophobia?,"Hey. I'm a 14 year old lesbian who's out at school. I kinda denied it until now but I realised today that I've been having a lot of internalised homophobia for a few years now, I think.

So today was my first day back at school and in PE we were told to sit on the floor in a line so that the teachers could sort out the attendance or something (I'm not really sure). I ended up sitting next to my friend which was purely a coincidence, and then she moved so she wasn't next to me anymore. I also didn't talk to her at all today.

I literally have no idea of anything I could have possibly done wrong. In fact, it's probably nothing which is the problem. Every time something like that happens, even if it's completely in my head which it usually is, my first thought is it's because I'm a lesbian. In this case it's completely ridiculous because she's so supportive and amazing. Anyway, I just assume it's because I'm gay even when half the time nothing's even wrong. It's always me who's the one making it about me being gay and being really paranoid which is why I connected it to internalised homophobia.

I'm not 100% sure though, and if it is, what can I do to fix it?",actuallesbians

Just a broken hearted bitch trying to get her bae back,"Just sharing my feelings. Positive feed back or words of wisdom are encouraged ‚ù§Ô∏è

Recentlymy Gf and I broke up. It‚Äôs been an emotional roller coaster to say the least. As of now we‚Äôre on the terms of working things out in hopes to get back together. That being said I feel like things should be great and I should be happy with no heart ache. However that is not the case. It‚Äôs incredibly painful everyday. I keep hoping it‚Äôll get better but it never does. I can usually manage to get through the day and distract my self with work and other things but as soon as I get home the depression and anxiety tackles me to the ground. We talk every day and see each other on weekends but it‚Äôs not enough for me. We lived together for a long time so it‚Äôs even harder when we spend time together and it‚Äôs time for me to leave. Sometimes I feel like she‚Äôs handling it better than I am which stirs up my anxiety. I constantly feel like a mess while she‚Äôs as cool as a cumcimber. I Asked if it hurts her just as much and she told me I have no idea how much she‚Äôs hurting as well. I try to be vulnerable with her but she seems to get irritated that she has to reassure me things will be okay, so I try to limit that. I‚Äôd literally give anything to be a couple again but she doesn‚Äôt seem to be ready. And I‚Äôm incredibly impaitent. Which is most likely half my problem. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm stupid for putting myself through this pain but I know she‚Äôs my soul mate and we are meant to be together. I just don‚Äôt know how to cope with the pain. I go to therapy every week for it and it doesn‚Äôt work. Any one have any suggestions on how to get by? TIA",actuallesbians
Really confused &amp; feeling alone?,"Hey everyone!  Sorry for incoming wall of text and ramblings.  I'm extremely confused about my sexuality and I really don't know what to do at this point.  It's really causing me to feel depressed and anxious about who I am, and I was hoping this place could help some.

I've always known I like women.  The only real, strong romantic feelings I've had have been on women.  I've only envisioned myself in the future with a woman.  I've never fallen ""in love"" with a man, but I have with women.  If there's anything I'm certain of, it's that I love women.

But I've only felt this strong romantic attraction very, very few times in my life - I don't develop crushes easily or at all, really, until that person gets very close to me.  And I've been aroused by both women and men when I'm placed in sexual situations with them (but more men because I've just been in more sexual situations with men for various reasons).

But if a man tries to pursue anything with me, I just daydream about ways I can get away from that relationship.  If I ever had a ""crush"" on a man in passing, it immediately disappeared and turned into dread the second he reciprocated.  That doesn't happen with women.  The only ""man"" I did pursue sexually and was really aroused by ended up being a trans woman - but if I liked her before she came out, does that still make it pursuing a ""man"", for sexuality purposes?  I know that appearance doesn't make a woman a woman or a man a man, but I don't know what *does*, and how that factors into attraction.

I only get aroused when I'm actively in a sexual situation, or when reading porn that's detached from me entirely.  I can't get turned on by porn with real people regardless of gender, and I've never fantasized and have never wanted to - but that's not normal, right?

I feel like it's like I've pulled three lobsters out a ""people I can have real, deep romantic feelings for, and want to be in a relationship with"" lake and they're all blue.  Wouldn't it be wrong to assume every lobster in this lake is blue from that pathetic sample size?  I just feel like I can't completely rule out that I might like men in a real way because it *might be true*.  I have no idea.

There was a post a couple days ago about someone who felt like they might actually be pan, but only dated women and only felt comfortable with women, and so called herself a lesbian.  The community here hated that  - the consensus seemed to be that if you ever liked, or ever *could* like a man at any time in any capacity, you are not and cannot ever call yourself a lesbian.  I dated a boy when I was 15 and I didn't despise it, but we didn't really do anything either.  i feel like that means I can't be a lesbian?  Although, I did remember being really happy after breaking up.

So now, I feel like I can't call myself a lesbian because I'm not *sure*, and I don't really feel fully comfortable with ""bisexual"" either - because I feel like that implies that I'm attracted to both men and women in the same way (not the same frequency, but the same 'way'), and that's not true.  It's all fucked up.  I'm not sure what to do, or where I stand.  I don't feel like a normal, functional person.  Can anyone shed light on this, or provide insight?  How do you *know* you're gay?  

How do you shake off the feeling that it's *possible* to feel like this for a man, or that since you like men in very specific situations on Tuesday on a blue moon, you are attracted to them in the same way as women and must be bisexual?

**edit**: I'm curious for you lovely lesbian ladies: how is kissing/having sex/being in a relationship with a man different from the same with a woman you don't ""like"" that way?  ",actuallesbians

Have you ever dated a woman who was significantly taller/shorter than you are?,"Hi, so my question is just what it says on the tin. I currently have my eye on a girl and have it from a good source that she's bi.

 I'm pretty sure I have a crush on her and I'd actually like to go for it for once: ask her out on a date. Yet, I also have this nagging hang-up cause she looks very tall. (I estimate her at like 6 ft. and I'm usually pretty spot on about this stuff.) Meanwhile I'm only a little over 5 ft. 2, so a midget basically compared to her. The times I've been talking to her, the height difference wasn't that bad, but that's because I wear really high heels. Even then, there was still a difference and she usually wears sneakers, so yeah... once the shoes come off, I'll probably look like a kid to her.

So yeah, I'd just like some experiences. Do these kind of relationships work out or is the difference in height always gonna be an awkward factor?(can't always be in high heels, after all) Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I've legit never crushed on someone waaay taller than me and it's making me feel kinda insecure and inadequate. I'd never reject someone based on height, but I could actually understand a very tall person rejecting a shorty like me.",actuallesbians

Is what my friend said homophobic?,"Had been feeling down this evening and just worked out why. Was chilling with my flatmates and a couple of friends. One of the friends is gay too (a guy - call him Joe). The conversation was about something to do with coming out to parents.

One of my best friends who is a straight girl said ""I think it's just that parents don't like to think about their children having sex"". Ben challenged her and said ""what cause gay sex is disgusting is It?!"" And she tried to explain but struggled to articulate it. 

I said to her I didn't think it was any different to a parent knowing their straight child had a bf/gf and would be having sex, why was gay sex the problem?

Then I tried to understand where she was coming from and help her out as she is from a small town and a bit sheltered and I could tell Joe was a bit offended. I was asking if she was meaning cause gay sex is different to the status quo. Any way she just said she couldn't explain it.

Dealing with feeling used,"Something's been weighing on my mind for a while, so thought it could be useful to post here. It's mostly to vent, but I'd be interested in hearing from others who have experienced similar or have any words of advice/encouragement.

I dated a woman I knew socially through a sports club. We are both in our thirties, both had been single for a while before dating, and had expressed interest in finding a partner. I was attracted to her when we met, but was hesistant to ask her out at first because of our shared club (what if it went wrong?!). Eventually, it seemed likely that the attraction was mutual, so I asked her out. She admitted that she was also a bit nervous about what could happen if things between us went pear-shaped, but that she found me attractive and thought we had quite a bit in common. She also seemed a bit wary that I might only be after a hook-up, but I assured her that I had genuine dating in mind. After this very candid conversation, we became involved. 

We dated for 2-3 months, and it felt very much like the start of a healthy relationship to me. I was briefly concerned the first night we spent together, as she wanted to take things further than I did and put a bit of pressure on me to turn my 'no' into a 'yes.' With hindsight, this is a major red flag. But, at the time, I put it down to her just being a bit over-eager, and once I explained to her that I wanted to slow down and not rush things sexually, she seemed to understand. Apart from that, things were good: dinners out, cutesy text messages, little inside jokes, and gradual sharing of more personal stories. We even spent Christmas and Boxing Day together (circumstances prevented us from travelling home, so it wasn't like the result of a long-standing plan, but it was still a very nice time). 

Only, then she seemed a bit distant, and I got the definite feeling that something was wrong. I told her that if she didn't think our relationship was developing, she should let me know. She then admitted to me that she never intended to be a relationship with me and that she thought it was just a 'casual thing.' This came as a complete surprise to me. I ended things right then.

We tried to stay on friendly terms after this, but I found myself increasingly upset and replaying our entire 'relationship.' There was really nothing that had given me any indication that it was a 'casual thing.' When we talked about us, it always sounded like we were on the same page: we were dating with a view to seeing if we were compatible for a long-term relationship.

I told her this and asked why she hadn't been upfront with me, especially after the conversation we had before we even started dating. She told me that she had decided to 'revert to casual' when she realised there were things about me she didn't like and didn't want to be in a relationship with me. I asked why she did that, instead of just telling me that it wasn't going to work out. She replied, 'Well, no one wants to be alone.'

Things got very messy when I tried to explain to her that I don't think that's an okay way to treat people. We haven't spoken since, and it's highly unlikely that we ever will. I no longer go to the sports club. 

Most days, I am pretty much over things. I have gone on some dates since then, but haven't really felt a connection with anyone. I think I am still very bruised from this experience. It's not so much that things didn't work out or that we weren't on the same page. It's that she admitted the only reason she kept dating me was because she didn't want to be alone. It's really knocked my confidence. Like, she decided that I was not good enough for her to be in a real relationship, but that I was okay to keep around to date/sleep with on occasion. Meanwhile, I was clearly under the impression that we were in the early stages of a new relationship. That, combined with her coercive behaviour on the first night, makes me feel really used and manipulated. 

On one hand, I probably dodged a bullet  here, and I should be thankful that I figured out what was up before I got too emotionally involved. But, it's still hard to deal with the feeling of being used, and the angry way she reacted when I told her that I didn't think staying friends was healthy really shook me. So, here I am.

is it possible?,"I am 27 years and my partner is 30 years. We are together for approximately two years. We have been living together for a year. We had  an argument and something came up and it had me wondering so here it is. 

So as individuals everyone has this imaginary person in their head of the type of person they would like to be with and that person would have certain qualities, be a certain way etc.

My girlfriend told me that she know she is not the partner that i wish i had and that is true.  and She told me that i am not the partner that she had wished she had. We both know that nothing is perfect and we can't always get what we want and this imaginary person we have in our head is just not possible in real life. We settled for each other and are trying to accept one another.  

**My question is , is it possible to be with the type of person we want to be with? Do they exist?**

I want someone who is loving, who helps in the kitchen when i cook, just to be present. Who helps with chores. Who isnt always occupied by their phone, game or internet. Who just randomly hugs and kisses me. Who could get up and make something for themselves to eat.

is this too much lesbian drama?,"Ok so, I need some advice. We all know lesbian drama gets complicated when you have a large number of gay friends.

We moved on in different ways, I slept around (still do), and she went on a shit ton of dates and kind of drifted out of our mutual friend group. 

In May she got a new girlfriend (who I totally get along with!) and slowly started coming back into our group of friends. The thing is, she went on like two dates with this smoking hot butch (20F) around April. And this girl is HOT. Like, crazy hot in that way only butches can be.

Tell her I want more or end it?,"I've been in a friends-with-benefits/ ""fuck-buddy"" relationship since 2015 with an older woman (34 years older to be exact..). We met when the company I'm associated with did some work with her brand, sparks flew but we didn't do anything about it until the project ended.

Since our jobs require traveling, she flies into Tokyo once every couple of months and I fly to Europe or New York City whenever I get a chance to be in those places for business. We meet, have some romantic nights, then one of us leaves, rinse and repeat. It's an arrangement that has worked for us since we're both workaholics, she has kids, and due to her brand she can't be seen on something like Tinder/Her/PoF to meet women or men. She doesn't want to come out as bisexual to the world because she's very private, but her close friends and family know.

She sent me an email four hours ago telling me that she's in a new relationship with a man, but still wants to keep up our private love affair (she's up front with all of her lovers about being bipoly). It just hit me that I want more from her, I want to be the one she's seen with in public. I need more from her, but in the back of my mind I know I'll never get that from her. She's coming to Tokyo in a few days for business, and we'll be seeing each other, hopefully we can get out from underneath the sheets long enough to talk.

Her life is complicated and she has stated not wanting a relationship (with other people) right now. I need advise on how to break the ice, how to tell her without damaging the friendship. I have never been in this position, althought I trully enjoy what's happening, I have been very anxious since realizing I'm falling for her. I don't necessarily want a relationship either, but would like to know how she feels and that I am not alone in these feelings. ",actuallesbians

"How fast to bring up the ""just friends""","So I've been on several first dates lately (Tinder) and although many of these girls I found nice I don't think there is a romantic or even hooking up kind of interest from my side towards them.

Few of them have expressed interest in seeing me again, and I wouldn't mind but strictly platonically - and I wonder if it's presumptuous of me to reply with that? Like I thought you're a cool girl and I wouldn't mind hanging out with you again but I think we'd be better as friends or something like that?

"To the girl who comes next,","To the girl who comes next,

I think we need to talk. You've been on my mind a lot lately, you know. I try to get on about my business, try to live my life and make something of myself. But you come to mind pretty often, and I just think you should know that. And I think there are some more things you should know, too.

First, I'm sorry in advance that I'm going to be so difficult. I'm a slow burn kind of person, and I'm not going to know how much I love you right away. I'm going to think that I like the shape of your mouth when you smile, and I'm going to think that I like the choice of your words, but it‚Äôs going to take me a while to be okay with feeling more than that, and even longer to be able to admit it out loud to you or anyone else. There will be days when I will leave you wondering how I really feel and I promise it's not on purpose. There will be times that you will try to hint how you feel to me, and I will not reciprocate, because I am useless and oblivious. I'm already sorry for it, but maybe it will make a good story someday. 

I'm also sorry for living in my own head so much. I'm sorry for being just totally horrible at math, and for persistently wearing nothing but a slightly varied flannel-tee shirt-leggings combo. I'm sorry that I'll forget the dates of anniversaries and that your parents are coming to visit this weekend, no matter how many times you remind me. I'm sorry for drawing on every piece of paper that ever comes into the house--I'd like to blame it on the art degree, but still. I'm sorry for making jokes as a way to deflect when I'm uncomfortable. I'm sorry for knowing too many weird facts about serial killers, and for bringing up Ted Bundy the first time I meet your friends. I got nervous, it just happened, I couldn't have stopped it if I'd wanted.

But I hope you'll be patient with me, and that you'll find good in there somewhere. I can do all the art projects, and mow the yard, and YouTube the small house repairs. The spiders are all yours, though, because no creature but the devil himself could ever have that many legs. When I'm too quiet during a conversation it‚Äôs because I'm really listening, and trying to find the right combination of words for the situation. Because words are important, and I can promise to never use them haphazardly. I can promise that when we inevitably fight, I will never say something strictly with the intention to hurt you--because word choice is never more important than when you're tempted to throw out the sharpest ones available. 

I can't promise I'll be perfect. I can't promise I'll always be fun. I can't promise that this will last forever. But I can promise that while it does last, I'll do my very best to make you laugh every day. I'll do my best to make you feel heard, and wanted, and loved. 

And, yeah, on my low days, the days when my unearned but considerable self-confidence eventually wavers, it does get hard to believe you're even out there. Because maybe some people were just meant to be alone, y'know? And maybe I'm one of those people. Who's to say? 

But if you are out there, then--

Hey. What‚Äôs up?

--Sincerely,
Me",actuallesbians
Does anyone else find it difficult to make friends with other women in the LGBT+ community?,"I don‚Äôt know why but it seems that even approaching a woman who also likes women, strictly to initiate friendship, is often seen by the other person as coming onto them. Surely not everyone has such a tremendous ego that they assume all women want to be with them in some capacity, but building a good, open friendship seems nearly impossible. I can understand if you are two fundamentally different people with nothing in common, but to ghost or tell someone who you could get along with that you‚Äôre just not into it is absurd to me. Do you need to be friends with everyone who wants to get to know you? No. It seems that if they don‚Äôt find you attractive, you‚Äôre not worth their time. You can have LGBT+ friends without any expectation of desire.

The most embarrassing thing happened to me just now...,"Ah. Technology. I love you, but you failed me tonight.

Okay so I have a new phone, and there's this fancy function that if you're in a message thread of someone, all you have to do is raise your hand up to your ear to start calling them. I guess to minimize button tapping. 

Anyways...so, my ex and I have a long ass history, and are still somewhat friends and catch up from time to time. It's been a few months since the last time I talked to her though. 

So here I was in bed, having a nostalgia moment, and I scroll back and start reading some of our texts. First mistake. 
Then, something on my leg started burning, so I was scrambling under my covers to scratch it. And somehow while doing this, that fine little gesture activated. And I didn't even realize it while wrestling with my covers. And I hear this faint ""hello?.....uh..hellooo?"" 

And then...it hit me. I looked at my phone and cue the heart dropping to the floor feeling. I panicked and didn't know what to say...so I quickly re-routed the conversation and was like hey! Remember that show we used to watch? New season is out! Didn't know if you knew...
Thankfully she seemed to not notice my awkwardness and we talked for a bit. But omfg really phone?!

It‚Äôs been a really weird whirlwind of emotion and I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone about this until a couple of weeks ago. Which was a really dumb move on my part- but I wasnt ready. 

Now that I‚Äôve spoken to a few friends I feel a lot better and although a big weight has been lifted off me, it‚Äôs just made me want to step back from this crazy work load and spend more time focusing on my degree, getting a graduate job as I‚Äôm going into my last year of uni and trying to understand myself more.

The thing is, I already know she is a virgin and has had very little/no experience with anyone, and she is self-conscious about it.

I have no problem with her lacking experience, and I'm happy she felt like she could trust me enough to tell me. But knowing that it's a big deal for her makes me super anxious that she will find it awkward and not enjoyable at all, I guess because of my own lack of confidence.

How to figure out my identity? I don't seem to fit into one.,"So for the past 2 years or so I kept experimenting between butch and femme. I'll present femme for like 3-5 months, then butch, and then repeat. The thing is, I don't know which I am, as I have both feminine and masculine characteristics. I sit and walk in a masculine way, and I consider myself chivalrous. With a girlfriend, I won't hesitate to put my coat on her if it's cold and love to hold doors open or pull out her chair. I like masculine clothing.

On the other hand, I really like feminine things. I like cute stuff like purses, those puff ball keychains, and I play around with makeup often. I like cute looking shirts like ones with sequins or sparkles. I'm also sensitive and nurturing. 

And whenever I present a certain way, it doesn't feel ""right."" When I call myself butch, don't wear makeup, wear men's clothing... It doesn't feel like I'm being ""me."" And when I'm feminine presenting and choose to wear cute things, wear makeup, carry around a purse, etc. It doesn't feel like I'm being ""me"" either. And I *do* enjoy presenting both ways. But when I present one way, I tend to sort of miss the other. And then I go back and forth between the two. 

Then I feel awkward when I switch. Right now I'm feminine presenting and I feel weird when I sit like a man, walk in a masculine way, and act chivalrous towards women. But when I dress butch, I feel the desire to carry around a cute purse and wear beautiful makeup. Basically my masculine and feminine traits are about equal (50/50) and I can't figure out a way to comfortably present without ""missing out"" on the other side. If I present masculine, I'm missing out on aspects of femininity that I like. If I present feminine, I feel like I'm missing out on aspects of masculinity that I like. 

Does anyone else have this problem? And how do you figure out how you identify? I don't fit solely as either a butch *or* a femme as my masculinity and femininity is around 50/50.

EDIT: [Here](https://forum.emptyclosets.com/index.php?threads/cant-decide-if-im-butch-or-femme.346557/) is a post I found by someone else who is having the same issue, she describes a lot of the issues I'm having :/",actuallesbians

I am one of those really feminine girls that just ""looks straight.""  No one in a million years would guess by looking at me that I'm gay as all hell.  However, my girlfriend, who is literally the most beautiful human being i have seen in my life, is easily identifiable as queer.

It's a long story, but I'll try to keep it short. 

* We are both bi. We have been friends since we started college and we just graduated in May.

* We had a falling out where we didn't speak for like a year and a half, basically all of junior and senior year. Centered around both of our depression, her lack of support when I came out, and when she thought I was jealous of her boyfriend. It's not as stupid as that, but it sounds stupid that summed up.

* This kid knows *everything* about me. I attempted suicide freshman year, and she saved my life that night. 

* When we had our falling out, I was absolutely inconsolable. I was crying constantly. I was trying to figure out then if i had feelings for her, and I never came to a conclusion. After graduation, I figured I would never see her again.
 
* We ended up moving to the same city. She came out of the woodwork in like July and we made amends.


So now, the question is back if I'm in love with her. We've kissed before (ya know, like the drunken thing that friends in college do), and then a like a month ago when we first talked about and addressed the fact that we hadn't spoken for nearly two years, we were both wasted. I know we made out, but I can barely remember it and I just kept apologizing the next morning and telling her I wasn't in love with her. 

And then like two weeks ago, she broke up with her boyfriend. (I know, I don't need a lecture about how shitty that was. I already know.) 

I don't know. My hands are shaking typing this and I feel like I wanna throw up. I don't know if I have feelings for her and I don't want it to be real. So I can't tell anyone in real life. That makes it real.",actuallesbians

Then I answered and I said I couldn't be bothered any more, with trying to figure out if she was really into me. She only really shows she cares when she thinks she's losing me. You see I had sent a message at 11pm and she'd stopped responding so I thought she'd gone to bed and would reply in the morning. However at 11pm the following day I realized, of all the things she was choosing to do that day, replying to me was not one of them. I sent her a message about how I was done trying to guess and I blocked her. I realize I must be needy, I get it, but just the thought that she didn't feel like talking to me that day, when I think I am in love with her, made me afraid. I am falling for someone who is nonchalant about me. I unblocked her and explained this to her and said sorry if I sounded mean on the phone.

Ok so I've been on two dates with this girl I meet on OKCupid. I really like them and they say that they like spending time with me as well. We're planning to go on a third date this Friday at her dorm to hangout and eat lunch together. (She has a private dorm and we won't be bothered for about an hour and a half.) 

Do you guys think I should make a move or wait it out? O r she might a make a move on me? I haven't been a relationship in a while and I want to take things slow but I don't want my chance to slip by. 

Any advice is appreciated! ",actuallesbians

Gayby‚Äôs....,"Alright. So here‚Äôs the thing. Everyone is a gayby at some point. I don‚Äôt discriminate against them when I find out they‚Äôre gaybys. But. More often than not, they‚Äôll either stand me up or say ‚Äúoops I forgot I have other plans that night‚Äù after we plan a date and then never commit to plans again. This is why I frequently hear from gaybys that their status as such is a deal breaker for more experienced lesbians. And it‚Äôs why I always try to give them a shot. But I can‚Äôt remember the last time a gayby came through on a date. And I‚Äôm talking to this ridiculously cute girl right now and I am watching this exact scenario unfold.

Ever see the 2012 movie Ambrosia? Do yourself a favour. Don‚Äôt.,"At first glance it looks like it‚Äôs about a woman in an unhappy marriage who decides to leave her husband as she starts falling for her female boss and questioning whether she was ever actually in love with him. The protagonist is from Iran, and is living in Canada. 

As the movie goes on, the boss goes from flirting and kind of testing the waters to see if the protagonist might be interested, to downright predatory. She corners the protagonist in the bathroom, asking why she‚Äôs so afraid to admit her attraction. Telling her it must be because she‚Äôs from Iran, and her values are behind where they should be. 

She tells her boss to go fuck herself and to leave her alone, which is great, but then the movie ends with her going back to her husband like everything is fine, when we just spent like an hour establishing how unhappy they are together. 

This isn‚Äôt a lesbian movie. It‚Äôs not an LGBT friendly movie. It feels a lot more like a queer baiting, queer coding mess, made to paint queer women as predatory home wreckers, and Canada‚Äôs values in a negative light. 

I‚Äôm super disappointed. ",actuallesbians

Is this ‚Äústraight‚Äù woman messing with me?,"There‚Äôs this girl from uni I‚Äôve had a crush on for a few months now. She has never made indication that she is lesbian/bi and has only ever talked about ex boyfriends. I tried to push her out of my mind because we all know how the dreaded ‚Äústraight girl crushes‚Äù end, but the other day when we were at a mutual friends birthday party there was this moment in our conversation when she stared into my eyes for a good 30-40 seconds nonstop (no exagerration) like she wanted to devour me (it was totally mutual though and I could not look away). Usually I avoid her eyes but the drinks were flowing and I was a bit tipsy so I had a little more courage than usual. 

I swear no straight girl even the ones that like to mess around with us to stroke their own egos could look into another girls eyes for that long like that. Hell I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had another queer girl maintain eye contact like that for that long before. It takes a hell of a lot of courage for anyone to do that imo.

Why I don't want Elsa to be the first Lesbian Disney Princess,"Every so often I see this pop up across the internet.  Being that, from what I can gather, a lot of the LGBT+ community resonated with ""Let It Go"", and society's idea that being single is the worst thing ever, it seems that people really want Queen Elsa from Frozen to be Disney's first lesbian princess.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let me preface this post by saying I am not Disney's number one fan.  I haven't seen every movie, I've only seen Frozen once, and in general I'm a little weirded out by Disney's constant presence.  Seemingly every (Western) fairy tale has a Disney adaptation, a lot of them miss the mark on the source material (I can rant for *hours* on Disney's The Little Mermaid), and with many people, if you speak out against Disney, people react as if you just spoke out against Christianity in the Bible Belt.  It's weird.  Disney movies are good, sure, but animated movies that aren't by Disney or Pixar are amazing too.  I'm personally massive fans of The Little Prince and The Last Unicorn, but I digress.  I'm very weirded out by Disney and by the people who call me a ""DISNEY HATER"" when I point out that these movies, despite their branding, are not perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

So.  Elsa.  She sang a song about living her best life and not hiding who she is anymore (while hiding from the world), and people ate it up.  It was basically Defying Gravity, only not by Stephan Schwartz, but it hit home for a lot of people, and I understand that.  People can take comfort and hope from any piece of music.  Let It Go, mixed with the fact that Elsa is independent and single means she is prime and ready for maybe deciding she isn't into dudes.  

&amp;#x200B;

Only, here's the thing: Elsa becomes the first gay princess, and that's it.  We're done.  We get a Disney Sequel Lesbian.  We get an Afterthought Lesbian.  We get a character who's sexuality is shoehorned in to appease a community and she's it.  We aren't getting another, not counting her Disney Sequel Girlfriend.  If Elsa is to become the first Gay Disney Princess, then her box is checked off the Diversity List, and you can file her between Mulan and Jasmine.  We're done here.  Next, in the sequel to Tangled, Rapunzel loses a leg.  

&amp;#x200B;

All people deserve representation in film, especially when those films are made by a massive corporation that shoves their products down the throats of every child world over.  All people deserve to have characters they relate to, who can help them to understand who they are, why they are good, why they are important.  This transcends race and sexuality.  People of different body types, genders, physical ability and so on and so forth deserve to see themselves represented, not just in a sequel, but as their own unique character who goes beyond that attribute. Having a character come out in the Sequel of a movie isn't ""Coming out of the closet"", it's just sticking a push lamp on the inside of the closet door.  It's the Diet RC Cola of coming out.  Having a character come out in a  Sequel leaves the girlfriend character trapped amoung the ranks of characters like Ariel's Daughter Melody and Simba's daughter... eh... Juliet? The sequel was based on Romeo and Juliet.  I don't actually know Simba's daughter's name, because she's just a Disney Sequel character.  She barely exists.  You won't see her on the cruise or in the parks, because that's what happens to Disney Sequel characters.  

&amp;#x200B;

As much as I want a Gay Disney Princess, I don't want Elsa to be it.  I want the first Lesbian Princess to have her *own* story.    I think we deserve that.  I think we deserve a character with an LGBT+ lead who just *is.* Full stop.  Let Elsa remain single.  I think we deserve that, too.  Disney can break the mold that Disney created by not forcing every main character to end up finding true love.  I find that I am struggling to put my thoughts into words cohesively.  I don't know if anything I have said has made a bit of sense.  I've been thinking about this for a long time.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, Elsa can't be the first Gay Princess anyways, because she isn't a Princess, she's a Queen.",actuallesbians

Advice please!,"I had been talking to this girl (let's call her Rose) on instagram but then she got into a relationship (it's been about 2.5 weeks now). I started hanging out with her and her gf at uni. They're fun to talk to and we're slowing growing a lil group of non-straight/cis people. Every time I've hung out with Rose, her girlfriend was with us until sunday night. I invited her to do face masks and hang out with my floormates. She came alone and slowly became more flirtatious. People started to leave at around 3am but she claimed she was ""really tired"" and that her res is ""too far"". I offered for her to stay the night and I said I would sleep in my roommates bed (she was out of town). She said she was comfortable sharing my bed with me and that she would be cold so I slept in my bed with her. Nothing sexual happened but she was cuddling up against me all night and it was quite intimate. She spent all of monday (yesterday) texting me and she came to hang out with my group of friends again.

Girlfriend came out to her mom and was called ‚Äúindecisive‚Äù,"My girlfriend (19F) and I(24F) have been dating for about a month now, we are both our first experience with women. Both of us dated men prior. She identifies as bisexual and so do I. I think neither of us expected to be dating a woman until we met each other. She‚Äôs wanted to tell her mom from the beginning because she doesn‚Äôt like going behind her back but never really knew how to bring it up to her so she has been procrastinating I guess you could say. Anyways, she decided to tell her tonight because she was tired of being stressed over it. She said the conversation went like this; 

Her: I have to tell you something 

Mom: oh gosh, it never ends well when you brings things up like this

Her: I promise it‚Äôs not that bad. Gabby (fake name for privacy) and I are dating. 

Mom: *silence*

Her: are you mad? 

Mom: I‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm just confused. 

Her: what are you confused about? 

Mom: What team do you swing for? 

Her: Both both men and women. 

Mom: I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the way it works, it‚Äôs usually one or the other

Her: I‚Äôm bisexual and I have periods where I prefer men and then periods I prefer women. 

Mom: *more silence* 

Apparently her mom just got quiet and really awkward and didn‚Äôt ask any more questions. She knows me, so I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt ask anything else about our relationship. I just hope she is just feeling awkward and is not actually uncomfortable about it. 

... anyways. My girlfriend is now in a terrible mood about her mom‚Äôs reaction. Personally, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the worst reaction she could have had. Her mom doesn‚Äôt understand, but she will eventually (she seems like an understanding women) and I think the most important thing is that my girlfriend is happy with me and the rest will follow... but she‚Äôs super stressed about her mom basically calling her ‚Äúindecisive‚Äù and the fact that she will probably have to have this conversation with her again. She has told me in the past that she HATES talking about her dating life with her mom and that when she tells her she wants to make it clear that she is Bi so that she never has to have this conversation with her again if she ever dates a guy in the future. Obviously that didn‚Äôt work out for her. 

She‚Äôs now in such a bad mood that she said she couldn‚Äôt talk anymore tonight and that she needs to sleep or something (I totally understand, I just wish she wasn‚Äôt feeling this way at all).

I‚Äôm not going to say anything tonight so that she can de-stress on her own, but does anyone have any advice of what steps she should take from here? Should she just leave it alone? I told her that she should say something like, ‚Äútell me what you‚Äôre thinking, I don‚Äôt like this awkward silence that‚Äôs happening, I‚Äôd rather you just ask me so that we can be on the same page‚Äù but she said that‚Äôs not the way their relationship works (I guess she is not that comfortable being so forward and open with her?)... 


TL;DR: girlfriend came out as bisexual and in a relationship with me... Mom was awkward and basically called her indecisive. Any advice for how to make things less awkward?

I‚Äôm a 21 year old female &amp; I feel I might be bisexual but I‚Äôm not sure. I feel like I‚Äôm attracted to both men &amp; women. I‚Äôve felt this way for a long time but I‚Äôve only recently thought/talked about it more. I talk about my sexuality with my friends mostly, my sister knows &amp; is supportive &amp; I told my mom a few months ago but she didn‚Äôt take it too seriously. I don‚Äôt want to tell my dad because he‚Äôs weird about this stuff. 
I‚Äôve been in very short relationships in high school but I‚Äôve never really dated anyone for real, I‚Äôve never kissed either.

I have recently made a friend that I‚Äôm so grateful for, they are so supportive &amp; I am much more outgoing than I used to be, They have really helped raise my confidence.

Is it possible to be a lesbian without really being attracted to women?,"That was probably a dumb title but oh well.

I‚Äôm not saying all men are like that. But I‚Äôve been thinking about dating women instead because I‚Äôve heard that many lesbians sometimes like to talk about their feelings and they seem to be open. I love that. I just want to love and feel loved and have a communicative partner. The only issue is that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm really attracted to women except maybe the more masculine ones. Sooo did any other lesbian or lgtbq person feel that way before? Also, are there any lesbians or lgbtq person who isn‚Äôt into looking at naked women so much?

Does accepting your gayness make you more gay?,"So I‚Äôve known that I‚Äôm gay for a couple years (I‚Äôm in my mid 30‚Äôs), but I always thought of myself as bi with more preference for men, so whilst I acknowledged my sexuality, I never really accepted it.  But recently, due to some personal circumstances, I had a bit of a revelation and properly accepted my sexuality.

Now that I‚Äôve embraced the fact that I‚Äôm gay, I find myself incredibly attracted to women.  Did this happen to anyone else?  I mean maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôd been denying that part of myself or something, but damn, I‚Äôm seriously girl crazy!  And I‚Äôm suddenly not that interested in men either.  I just kind of find them annoying.  I know that sexuality can be fluid, but this is really unexpected.

Unfortunately I only have one gay friend and have no idea how to start dating women üòÇ ",actuallesbians
Can men still direct lesbian movies.,"Hi, I'm a straight white male. Also an aspiring filmmaker. But here me out...

I have an idea for a screenplay involving a closeted women going to her religious family for Christmas. Its inspired by two of my cousins who have since came out as lesbians. 

Given the current climate in Hollywood, can I, a straight white male, still write and direct a lesbian centric movie? I care about this story, as it means alot to my family, but I'm worried it'll spark some outrage. If its ever made of course, all I've written so far barely counts as a spec script.",actuallesbians
Idea for a lesbian Disney Princess film (or at least some form of fairytale),"This was inspired by the previous post about why making Elsa a lesbian would be a bad idea as it would be like an afterthought. Keep in mind that is rough and has little detail. 

A King and Queen incur the wrath of a witch. The witch curses their newborn daughter so that no man will ever want to marry her. But the Princess grows up to be a lesbian and is overjoyed. She loves that her love is for other women only. The witch is angry that her curse has backfired, but then she begins to think the Princess is pretty attractive . . .

It's probably not that great and I probably won't get around to writing it, but I think it's a pretty cute idea.",actuallesbians
Being friends with an ex??,"Hey all,
So a few weeks ago my first relationship with a woman ended. It was short, less than 2 months but intense and amazing. Things ended because of circumstances beyond our control (life is complicated) but she is amazing and a super cool person and we both said we want to be in each others lives. Now my question is, is it possible to be friends with an ex, how the fuck do I navigate this. I never spoke to a guy I dated after things ended so I‚Äôve never had to deal with this. 
My straight friends all tell me it‚Äôs impossible....I hope not.

Should I come out to my mom?,"Hey! I would just like some advice on whether or not I should come out to my mom, because I‚Äôm really on the fence here.

I‚Äôm a lesbian, I‚Äôve known since I was an incredibly young age. My mom never shows any aggression/hate towards the LGBT community. She likes Ellen, she said before that she thinks Nate and Jeremiah (from a home renovation show) are a cute couple, I told her one of my friends was gay, and she was 100% okay with it.

However, I remember dropping HEAVY hints a year ago that I was gay, and my mom sat me down and said: ‚ÄúHoney, I don‚Äôt want you to be gay. People like that lead a very difficult life.‚Äù and a different time when I was talking about how girls are really pretty, she said: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say that. You‚Äôre not gay. You‚Äôre too young.‚Äù

So I have no idea what to do, honestly. She‚Äôs religious too, but she doesn‚Äôt believe that gay people are sinners, so that isn‚Äôt really a concern. I‚Äôve always talked about how attractive I find girls, and just in general my interest in the LGBT community, so I think if I do come out, she won‚Äôt be surprised.

So, what do I do? Any opinions? Any tips? Any advice is 100% appreciated, thank you so much for reading!",actuallesbians

Weirdest/ most awkward flirting experience by you or to you,"I've got 2. I was at a music festival with my aunt and holding our spot while she got water, this extremely pretty girl came up to me said, ""oh shit, you've got a butterfly on your back', she than gently took the butterfly off my back told me I was beautiful and walked whilst motioning me to follow her which I of course could not (we had some stuff at the spot to and I could carry all of it).   

Another time at a concert with my friend I spent the majority of the night flirting with this very cute girl. I'm a socially awkward person so the fact that this was going so well was a major victory. There was another girl with her who looked kinda similar to her and I figured was her sister. At one point the singer started making out with the bassist than he made an somewhat awkward yet sweet speech about love. The girl I was flirting with than made out with the person that I thought was her sister. I awkwardly still stood by them cause I'm very short and we were right that stage so I was unwilling to lose my spot. And she continued to compliment me throughout the night ",actuallesbians

being gnc/figuring out my identity,"hey all!
I added a content warning to be sure, this post is about having trouble with my gender.
First of all, i want to apologise if I'm being ignorant. I'm kind of new to questioning my gender, instead of only my attraction to women, so i'm not aware of all the issues surrounding this.

So i've been comfortable in my lesbian identity for more than a year now (but I've been aware of being a wlw for much longer). Ever since, i have identified as femme, since i believed that i really enjoyed putting on a show of being feminine, or my own take of it at least.
Since a few months I've been in a group chat with other wlw (before that i was pretty isolated from other wlw), and ever since i became more and more aware of how presenting as feminine feels like putting on a show, or like being ""in drag"" so to speak.

Last year was my first year in uni, which gave me more freedom to dress and act however i want, and I started wearing more GNC clothes (like patterned shirts, a tacky jacket, WIDE dungarees, etc) and got a more assertive attitude.
So i talked to my friends in the gc and many of them said they identified with wanting to be a gay man (even though I am not attracted to men) (i think one of them made a post about it in this subreddit or maybe the lgbt one) and i started thinking,,, maybe im NOT ,,,, woman..... but after that i was sorta dysphoric a few times, but I haven't been affected by that as much anymore. And i really don't want to equate butches to men, but i want to use it to illustrate that i feel some sort of disconnect from traditional womanhood.

Fast-forward to a few days ago, when i read a twitter thread (posted on tumblr) that was about how to present more gay, or on how to be more visible as a wlw. And i basically already did/identified with 95% of what OP wrote. At the end it said it was written by a butch lesbian and that really tipped me off (to my current uhmm gender troubles), because i previously hadn't REALLY given it much thought, and right now i'm considering the possibility that i could be. 

(I dont know if it's relevant but i basically dress like Antoni from queer eye, excect more colourful) (And of course it's not only about how you dress, but also body language, attitude etc)
The weird thing is that im kind of curvy, if i say so myself, and i don't really mind it, because I think it looks kind of cute (I do wear kind of baggy pants though), but i do mind it once im in the presence of men, like i don't want them to think of me as attractive in any way. It's cool with me when i'm with women, so that's a whole situation going on.

So i was wondering if there are any people out there who have gone through this or something similar, or maybe someone could point me to some resources so i can check it out myself. I scrolled through the butch tag on tumblr, but I haven't found something that is really relevant to me as of yet.
Thanks in advance :)",actuallesbians

Very confused by my new professor. She accidentally sexually harassed me?,"Throwaway because my friends know my account.

So I‚Äôm at a loss for what I should do. I‚Äôm 23 and recently returned to finish my undergrad. I had previously done 2 years of college but dropped out due to being unhappy and went to work for my dads company. While I really enjoy work I realize that I need a degree so I decided to go back to school for 2 years to finish my degree in Econ at this local small Christian college. So school started a month ago and I‚Äôve been working hard but most importantly I‚Äôm taking this Econ class from the department chair that is required to graduate. The first day the teacher assigned us to write a short paper on an economic topic that you‚Äôd like to research. Wanting to write about something I‚Äôm familiar with I wrote about the wage cap in contracting for LGBT peoples. In the essay I had some anecdotes from my experiences where I guess I basically said I was a lesbian. Flash forward a week later I stayed after class to talk to the teacher, who is a women in her 40s. We had been talking after lots of classes and she seemed to have taken a liking to me, she said; ‚Äúshe liked talking to an adult and not young undergrads.‚Äù Usually we just talked about random stuff in a very friend manner but this time she comes out and tells me all this personal information. She says that she got divorced from her high school sweetheart and came out as a lesbian. While I‚Äôm happy for her I thought that was a little to personally for teacher to share but I shrugged it off. The next day I stay and chat with her and she immediately goes in telling me about her new girlfriend and asks me all these questions about my SO which made me feel uncomfortable so I left and didn‚Äôt stay after the next class, I thought that I could just go to class and ignore her for the rest of the semester but I was wrong. After I stopped talking to her she the asked me to visit her during officer hours to discuss my grade. When I went to her office. We talked about school for maybe 10 minutes before she started talking about a hook up she had and went into somewhat graphic detail, which I of course thought was very unprofessional. I just went with it but what made me walk out of there and write this call for advice was she then pulled her top down exposing one of her breast to me and asked what I thought about her new nipple piercing she had. I just got out there as quickly as I could. I don‚Äôt know I what to do. On one hand you have what I think is just a lonely middle aged women who was in a terrible marriage for twenty years and is looking for a connection with a somewhat similar women which makes sense, she is always so shy around me. On the other hand she is making me pretty uncomfortable and I worry about if she doing this to other women. I guess I want her to be professional but I don‚Äôt know to who to turn to in my life. I think she‚Äôs just lonely so if I tell the school yes it stops but she gonna get fired and lose everything for something I think can be fixed. I don‚Äôt know. ",actuallesbians

Am I a terrible person for wanting to break up with trans boyfriend because I‚Äôm still very gay?,"Hi, lesbians...

After nearly 5 months dating my best friend again (after 6 years of breaking up and just being friends; 5 years after they decided to transition), I‚Äôm beginning to accept the fact that I‚Äôm dating a dude. 

He stopped taking hormones a few years ago after only a few months on T. Had top surgery. I‚Äôm realizing now I‚Äôve been clinging to his feminine voice, facial features and female genitalia as like this whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still sortaaaa dating a girl‚Äù belief system. Maybe I can make this working dating someone who goes by he. After all, he says he is trans masculine and more in between a man and a woman than a straight up man. That‚Äôs not fair to him.   

Then sometimes his habits throw me for a loop: he‚Äôll paint his nails, wear mascara and eyeliner, wear his sports bra instead of wearing a packer. Yeah it confuses me sometimes but I know he‚Äôs all about gender-bending. 

We got into a fight once totally unrelated to gender and he threw this at me: ‚Äúmaybe you shouldn‚Äôt be with me if you really want to be with a woman‚Äù. That hurt because it‚Äôs true. 

The honeymoon phase is over and I realize my current situation. I love him so much and care about him. I‚Äôm realizing some of our core values don‚Äôt line up; but I‚Äôm also realizing... I‚Äôm STILL gay and I am not dating a woman. And it feels like something is missing and I‚Äôm not being true to myself. 

For months I felt guilt about feeling this and I thought it was superficial. But I thought about ‚Äúhetero‚Äù couples where either the man or the woman comes out as gay and they eventually break up due to this. I empathize with that situation and don‚Äôt view the gay person as being superficial and sacrificing love for sex. Sometimes they stay together if they have children together or for other reasons. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. It doesn‚Äôt help we are in a LDR. I want to spend a weekend with him and see how I feel. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it to stay together with him and then have sex with other women. I  want my relationship to be monogamous and all-inclusive. 

However, I can‚Äôt help but feel like a terrible person for getting into this relationship with someone I adore; knowing that I am going to be with a trans guy. And now finding out I really wish I were with a woman. ",actuallesbians

I'm worried that I'm nobody's type,"I'm 20 years old, and I've been told that I don't look like a lesbian a lot of times. But I'm not particularly feminine either. I wear dresses, but I also wear blazers etc. I don't wear jewelry or make-up, and my hair is completely natural. I'm petite (I'm only 5'2), and quite slim. 

I just don't feel like lesbians like how I look, and I don't really know why because I get compliments whenever I leave the house and that's not even an exaggeration. Just today, I went out and two different people complimented my hair. My hair is blonde and extremely curly, so it's really big and voluptuous haha. I definitely stand out in a crowd and I get looked at a lot. But girls who are around my age don't tend to look at me that much, and I can't remember the last time a girl who I was also attracted to complimented me.

I just feel like because I don't fit into any strict stereotype or label, no girl will ever find me attractive enough to date because I'm not their type :/ And it really upsets me. Whenever I tell people about this, they just think I'm being silly. I consider myself to be about average on the looks scale. And it seems like the girls who I'm attracted to are far more attractive than me. They wear make-up and just look stunning, whereas I'm more natural and 'cute' I suppose. I just don't really know what to do or think. How can I believe all those compliments when I can't even find a girl to go on just one date with me?!?",actuallesbians

"EXTREMELY gay things I did way, way before I realized I was gay","I was driving today and remembered a couple of things I did when I was younger which were so incredibly, clearly gay that the mental gymnastics it took to convince myself I was straight should qualify me for an olympic award. I was absolutely convinced I was straight until I was 20 even though these things happened. It's a miracle. Here are some very real, very gay things I actually did which should have clued me in much sooner:

* Every year in Elementary school on valentine‚Äôs day, I wrote like a page-long anonymous letter to this one girl in my class and stuck it in her box. I‚Äôd write stuff like ‚Äúyour eyes are the prettiest shade of brown, you‚Äôre the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, and you should believe in yourself more.‚Äù I never signed my name. I didn‚Äôt question why I was doing this just for her and none of my other classmates.
* I wrote a song?? about how I suspected that one of my friends had a crush on me?? These were the lyrics:

‚ÄúWhen the sleepy curtain falls

Like the shadows on your walls

Do the dreams that creep into your sleep

Mean anything at all?

Do my own dreams coincide

With the things you try to hide?

Though my heart can scream, will simple dreams

Keep me satisfied?

Can I crash your dreams tonight, darling?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

* Made myself in The Sims in a house full of male and female love interests who had to compete for my affections a la *The Bachelor,* ‚Äújust to see‚Äù whether my sim would end up with a man or a woman ‚Äúfor laughs‚Äù and intentionally pushing her to marry the hot soft-butch crime queen in a leather jacket.
* Fantasized and wrote stories about myself as the chosen knight of this fantasy queen, played in my mind by a young Alex Kingston, and the very romantic relationship between these two characters. 
* Took the girl I wrote the song for to prom twice. Our senior year she asked me to skip prom with her to go to an anime con. I don‚Äôt even like anime but I said yes just so I could spend time with her while she sewed my costume.
* Changed in the bathroom stall in gym because I felt a vague sense of impropriety stripping down in a room full of all my female classmates who were also stripping down, and was also nervously aware that I was the only party following this chivalrous code.
* Cried on the bus to high school when I realized that I‚Äôd never actually marry my musical icon, singer-songwriter SJ Tucker, because she already had a long-term partner and was 15 years older than me and lived in Portland and had also never met me. It was a devastating blow
* Campaigned for gay rights as an ""ally,"" arguing that ""I should, hypothetically, be allowed to legally marry a woman. I wouldn't ever want to, but it really bothers me that I can't, on principle.""
* Had frequent, pleasant dreams about this powerful blonde woman dancing with me at a party and then kissing her. I woke up sad that she was gone. What did I think this signified???

There's probably so many more of these I just haven't remembered yet. It's mind-blowing how much gay stuff I did, fully believing I was either completely straight or mostly straight. Post in the comments some of your own baffling ""obviously I was gay how did I not see that"" stories. ",actuallesbians

The lady who owned the car had filled out the insurance thingy, and there was a witness name and # filled. It was her. I‚Äôve never spoken to her and now I probably never will, out of embarrassment. 

Also a couple of weeks ago i came across a girls Instagram account (Andy Cohen‚Äôs assistant) she pinged my gaydar as well and then, i saw that she has a gf. 

These things reminded me of a podcast episode of ‚ÄòThe L Word Made Me Gay‚Äô where they were talking about how the actress that plays Danna has a gay face.

I asked her to show me how to go down on her and wanted her honest feedback afterwards. She orgasmed (which I didn't expect to be able to make her do) so that was a nice ego boost, quite truthfully. I asked her what could've been better and she said I was using too much pressure (suction) on her clit, so I'll keep that in mind next time (hopefully tonight!) I've never felt this strongly about someone before and I'm just really excited to further explore not only the sex, but her as a person. ",actuallesbians

"just need a listening ear :( (closeted gf, unsure how to deal)","i am dating a wonderful wonderful girl who i have fallen hard and fast for. i adore her, i adore telling people about her, i adore being open (when we feel safe, so in empty bars or in gay bars or at my house). this is my first serious relationship (i'm 21, she's soon to be 22) and i love every moment of it. the only thing thats making me upset and sad is that she is in the closet to her family and to people she's not prepared to tell, like her housemates or anyone who doesn't come off as 100% okay with gay relationships. she's met my family and all my friends and they all adore her and yet i may never meet her family for a long time. i feel so selfish for feeling sad about this, because she absolutely needs to wait until she's certain that coming out is safe and won't affect her family relationship. i understand that totally, yet i'm plagued by a gentle feeling of being pushed into a weird liminal closet. i was over at her new apartment yesterday and out of habit she closeted us by introducing me to her housemate as her friend. i felt so disconnected from myself when she did that, and again i felt sad.

i feel so horrible that i'm finally putting this into words but i feel like i just need to tell someone who will understand. i love her so much and i dont intend on ending things, i just needed to put this into words.  i cant really explain this to anyone because my close LGBT friends are mostly gay single guys in their 20s who wouldnt dream of dating seriously for another decade. so i hope someone on here would understand and assure me that i'm not a monster for feeling sad about this. or if i am i hope someone will be honest and let me know i need to work on this somehow. ty &lt;3",actuallesbians

advice for a baby gay on taking initial steps to meeting girls,"Context: So I've been into girls since I can remember, my first sort of sexual experimentation was with girls. I've had a few sexual interactions with straight girls in my teens but nothing romantic or passionate, it was more just them drunkenly experimenting or their boyfriends talking them into threesomes. I've lived in a pretty small town for most of my teenage/young adult life &amp; there's never been a gay community here as far as I know. The only gay girls I ever met were from out of town &amp; already in longterm relationships or just not my type. I tried a dating app called HER &amp; I tried Bumble too but had absolutely no luck finding girls in my area &amp; I suck at texting anyway, I prefer face to face.   
I'm moving to the big city soon because I'm starting university ( in a week) &amp; they have a gay village but I'm super nervous about going out alone ( it's probably not the safest thing to do either) &amp; have basically no experience meeting or flirting with women.  I've been with guys but the older I've gotten the more I realised I'm not into them &amp; I just don't enjoy sex with them. I think maybe it was because growing up the norm was just to be with guys &amp; I always felt that it was expected of me to date men.  

This is all so new to me I feel like I'm at a disadvantage. I'm 20 frickin years old &amp; I'm completely oblivious to this sort of thing. So my questions are: 

* What did you guys do when you were young &amp; figuring out your sexuality &amp; trying to meet girls for the first time?   

* Did you go to gay bars?  

* How do you figure out which girls are actually gay?  

* Is flirting the same with gay girls as it is with hetero people or is it an entirely different ball park?   

* Do I actually have to cut my nails short or is that just a stereotype cause like I have sex toys &amp; a tongue, I don't need my hands, do I?  

* What in the ever loving f\*ck are all these categories &amp; labels &amp; slang anyways?

Asking Girls Out,"I've been in the dating game for some time now and I'm starting to get a little tired of the same old song and dance. I want to get some opinions from all kinds of lesbians on my planned approach.

For a little background, I'm a femme who dates femmes but I have never really asked someone else out because I enjoy single life. I don't mind the time in between dating and relationships so I don't really date until someone else asks me out. Most of the girls I've dated thus far have been older or slightly more dominant so they've always made the first move but lately I've also found myself attracted to slightly younger girls who, I guess, are more on the shy or submissive side? I'm not sure. Anyway, this means I probably have to make the first move to get the date and so I've started sending the first message. I've actually gotten responses to most of my first messages but our conversations just kind of taper off and so I just back off because I figure they're not interested and I don't want to come off as too aggressive. But, I also just want to know for a fact that they're not interested because I've been learning about the concept of the 'useless lesbian' and that's just confusing the situation more haha. Besides, I've learned that lack of text chemistry doesn't always equate to lack of in person chemistry so it'd just be nice to be certain that things wouldn't work out before I write off a person in a small pool of options.

How would you feel if someone you kind of knew or someone you didn't know at all just straight up asked you if you were seeing anyone and if you wanted to go on a date? Please be honest and think about how you would actually respond and not the way you wish you would respond. And sorry for the wall of text!",actuallesbians
Relationship Advice.,"Soooo, I post infrequently and I lurk a lot, but I thought it best to actually solicit the advice of strangers regarding this issue.  I'm hoping you all can help me out.  I really debated on where to post this given the topics at hand, but this sub seems like it would give me the best advice.  I kinda love this place. :-)

Also, after typing this out I'm apparently long winded.  Sorry!

Anyway, a bit of background.  I'm a trans bi girl who's been dating a cis lesbian for over a year.  I'm 19, she's 20, and we both attend a fairly prestigious liberal arts college.  We actually just moved into an off campus apartment together, and we're both loving it.  So, what follows is something of a persistent problem, but it's more of something that could become a major issue if we let it.

Now, to it.  It's been a fairly rough year for both of us.  Nothing extremely relevant on my end.  Just some family stuff and a really bad experience on a new HRT drug.  My girlfriend's problems are more relevant.  I'm not sure if this is a fair comparison, but it does come from a longtime friend of hers.  She compared her to a much more toned down Eliot Reid from Scrubs.  Hyper intelligent, a bit self-serious, extremely sweet, but also full of neurotic self-doubt.  Pretty accurate.

Her issues are kind of centered around her weight.  She's by no means heavy, just curvy.  It's not a weight issue, it's just how she's built.  In high school she moved from fad diet to fad diet until her mom put her foot down, and my experience is that beyond a little self-deprecation she had been okay with it until some asshole tried to hit on her earlier this year, got shot down, and called her fat in retaliation.  It's really been bothering her for months, and it kind of crested last night.

Yes, we're both underage, but this does involve alcohol.  We had friends over to just hang out, and by the end of the night it was just the two of us with a classmate and her boyfriend.  Everyone was pretty buzzed, and I don't actually remember how we got on the issue of her appearance, but it devolved into the three of us trying to get her to see how pretty she is.

And then she outed me.  I've run pretty stealth around campus (she knows, obviously, and so do some professors and close friends).  I'm still deciding how open I want to be about my trans status in general so I've shied away from talking about it.  Anyway, she is a couple of inches taller than me, and given I'm pretty thin and an early transitioner there isn't much ""boy"" in my physique.  I'm not going to restate what she said, but she compared the two of us, referenced my trans status, and made note that she's ""bigger"" than me.

It WAS an accident.  I mean, seriously, the ""Oh shit""s and apologies started right away, and the truth is I'm not all that angry.  I think I will be if it happens again.  It is my business who knows, honestly, and it's shitty to remove that choice from me.  Still, accidents happen, and the two friends are cool enough people.  So, that isn't the issue.

The issue is I really think she'd benefit from seeing someone professionally at this point.  She's close with her mom, and she's been pushing her in that direction too.  I don't want to feel like I'm piling on, though.

So, thoughts?

I looked down to meet her gaze and see what was up. Without saying a word, she hands it to me and my purpose became clear. 

I shed my flannel, fastened my sports bra, slapped on some Bengay and put my hair up in a bun. I gripped that fearsome jar and twisted with all my might until a very satisfying *pop* echoed throughout our apartment. With a smile on my face, she takes the jar back from me.

How do you typically respond to being asked out?,"We've all seen the posts about useless this or that, or mutual crushes that go without being acted upon due to crippling shyness or awkwardness. 

But what do you do when another woman asks you out? When they actually use the words, ""can I take you out sometime?"" 

Do you say yes? Do you play bashful, giggle, then run away? I'm slowly gaining the sense that some women don't really like being asked out on a date. If that's the case, how else is the whole dating/ wlw thing supposed to work? Is asking someone out, while being explicit that yes, you'd like it to be a date, too forward or offputting?

I also have the same question (which is one many of us have asked) about mutual matching on dating apps.

‚ÄúI thought LGBT people are hornier‚Äù,"That was in response to me wanting one of my dates go well.. 

I know I posted only a couple days ago. But gawd was this the most infuriating gaslight filled conversation...

So I‚Äôm talking to a guy friend ‚ÄúMatt‚Äù about how I have a few dates lined up and I‚Äôm hopeful at least one will go well. To me- going well is having a connection, getting a second date, a kiss would be nice. Clearly to him- wanting a good date or the definition of a good date is sex. 

Anyway. I told him- not true. LGBT people are just people. He tells me this is based on something someone from the community says and all girls are different. So I reply about how all LGBT people are different, you can‚Äôt sum up an entire community based on a friend. I tell him what he‚Äôs saying is offensive. 

He tells me it multiple friends. I say it could be 100, still not enough to speak for an entire community... he tells me 10 is a big enough sample size in statistics. No it isn‚Äôt. 

Then he tells me how gay men have more sexual partners and for me to find him a gay man who hasn‚Äôt had at least 10 partners.... for one- gay men do not make up the entire LGBT community. Two- virgins are plenty horny, statistics cannot speak to horniness and sexual partners does not equal horniness. Three- I can find plenty of Herero men &amp; women who‚Äôve been with over 10 people- still doesn‚Äôt speak for an entire community. 

So I explain to him how not only is that untrue but that isn‚Äôt what he said. He didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúgay men on average have more sexual partners‚Äù 

And he has continued and continued and continued. Saying I can‚Äôt argue statistics, saying numbers and facts are just that, telling me I could offend a mathematician, telling me I‚Äôm insecure, telling me I‚Äôm jumping to conclusions, that I need to educate myself.. 

Like no. I‚Äôm not. He legit said ‚Äúlgbt people are hornier‚Äù and is now trying to gaslight the situation and say he said something different and I‚Äôm the sensitive baby for feeling offended. 

I‚Äôve been out as liking girls for over 10 years and I can‚Äôt believe that one of the fights that is still being had is that LGBT people are all out for sex and it‚Äôs just for sex and we‚Äôre just a bunch of horny animals... I just want a girlfriend to cuddle with and grocery shop with and pick pumpkins with... 


Tl;dr
Dude tells me lgbt people are hornier.. when I express that that is offensive, changes his wording to statistics and gaslights the situation- then insulted me (because I clearly don‚Äôt know math).. tired of having to remind people that it‚Äôs not all about sex..

Statistics are only good if the sample size and group is good.. statistics about sex are known to be problematic because people lie. And beyond that- sexual partners does not fucking equate to horny levels.. ",actuallesbians
Help for a baby gay,"UGHH why is it so hard to be sure of things.

For context: I'm 24 and I've never been able to sit properly. Every time I get to a place in my head where I'm like ""yep ok defffffffinitely gay or at least mostly into girls,"" I second-guess myself. There is no reason to fear coming out to my family, friends, or community, I have the most supportive people in my life. And yet, I have this feeling that if I declare that I'm gay or mostly gay (I know that's not a real thing but I mean it in terms of sexuality as a sliding scale lol), that I'll suddenly realize I'm not and then have to un-come out. I've mentioned this to my sibling and some close friends years ago, and they're all so supportive but obviously can't help me all that much. I've told my mom, very very casually, that I'm open to dating whomever. So casually that she called me back days later to confirm that I said what I said haha. So everyone kinda knows I'm not 100% straight... But I don't like conversations in which someone says ""future husband,"" or asks about my dating life as if I date men. I'd like to be able to officially come out, but I'm just not fully comfortable with any one label yet. I know that you can know without dating experience, but I've never dated or done anything romantic with a girl before - I've never even had a crush on a friend! My crushes were always actors, teachers (lol just saw a sub on this), occassionally bosses. So I worry that maybe I just have really bad intimacy issues and I'm trying to give myself an out and say that I'm gay -- and then when I start dating women, I'll realize I'm not cut out to date anyone! 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the best way to be sure of myself is to actually go on dates with girls. I'm on bumble and have talked to a few girls, but haven't met up with anyone yet. Since I'm still not completely sure, I don't want anyone to think I'm just experimenting on them. I don't want to pretend I have more experience than I do because I want someone to be aware of that in case I'm super nervous, but I worry that most women won't want to date me because they don't want to be used. 

&amp;#x200B;

That was mad confusing so feel free to ask me to clarify anything.

TL;DR I think I'm gay and want to come out but I'm nervous that I'm not actually gay and will have to un-come out.

Literally can‚Äôt do makeup,"Aw hey

Wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with makeup.

I can‚Äôt do it. Even if I wanted to and gave it a try it always came out like shit. I feel so intimidated by makeup that I usually just choose to go without any. The most I attempt to do is a tinted face lotion and mascara ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I would ask straight friends for help, but I feel like I couldn‚Äôt translate their routines into my own comfort level of femininity. (I would say I‚Äôm femme but straight girls say I‚Äôm androgynous if that gives a good idea of how I present)

Any advice? What‚Äôs your personal makeup routine?

I want to share my uselessness from today...,"On two separate occasions today, 15 mins apart, with two different people, I was completely useless.

First, as I was packing up at the end of one of my classes, I noticed this girl wearing a ridiculously skimpy button-down shirt.  It had only a single button fastened. And when she turned at all, you could see the entire side of her tit.  I thought she might not realize, almost said something, but looked back at my things.  When I looked back. She was looking at me with a smirking look of acknowledgment.  She noticed me noticing her tits, and she's smiling and smirking at me.

What do I do?  Look away in shame and almost break down crying. (years of repression and shame.)

Then while recovering from that, waiting for the bus to go home, a completely different girl, a real cutie, from across the road seems to have noticed me.  She has her phone out and is pointing it in my direction. ""Oh god really?"" I think, assuming she's marveling at a transwoman in a big red dress on the side of the street.  No, she actually crosses the street super smilely and even hesitant to approach me and talk to me.  I realize she's looking to say something and take off my headphones.  She compliments my dress and has the biggest smile on her face.  I thank her and put my headphones back on and turned away. 

She left.

Neither of those behaviors are overtly ""lesbian signals"".  At least not from what I experienced.  But still... God fucking dammit. ",actuallesbians

I have given up dating. Is anyone else feeling the same?,"This is so long, sorry!I hate to be the downer, but I think I am just done.I am an out queer lady.

My friends and family are baffled as to why I am single.I turn 43 on Monday. I take care of myself, I am told I have a baby face for my age. I am almost 6'2"" (I think this is part of the issue). My classmates recently thought I was their age in the late 20s (I just exited college after many years).

Dudes hit on me every single place I go (ugh). It is always the same, but so is dating women. Same drama. Drama llama.

I have been in only long term relationships. When I am not,  I have been on more coffee dates than I think a human should go on. I almost never, ever kiss on the first date. I just do not feel kissing a stranger to be my thing. I need someone to make love to my brain before my body.

I was married long ago--longest relationship 8 years. I take time off between serious relationships, and have been in a handful.

I was once marked clinically abstinent in my medical record for two years, and despite going on dates and people wanting to kiss me, I did not kiss them. I just did not feel it, mostly.

On paper, as some like the lists, I sing in a band which produces CDs, but that is on the side. I have a degree in science, upper level, I volunteer, I help children and animals, I love sci fi, I am a nerd, I go trail running, I love Kant, not materialistic or snobby, I tutor the underprivileged for free to bridge the gap between Caucasian privilege and those who are not, love the 80s and arcades, I run my neighbors' dogs, I am thoughtful, considerate, compassionate--which brings me to the issue.

People are not as considerate as I am, and I get seen as a fetish too.Let me explain, and take no offense please, as I speak very matter of fact.

I think every transgender woman on Okcupid in the entire United States, if they have seen my profile,  have asked me out, but there is ONE reason for this and ONE reason only, and it has been admitted to me by almost everyone.. I have been told by more than one transgender woman, that I am ""the holy grail"", because of my height. So , I hear from some of my transgender women friends (I am friends with many people), that they are considered a fetish by some, but I am being considered as a ""prop"" girlfriend because of my height--they can wear heels around me and feel more feminine. WTF,  and it is pissing me off now. How nice to put their arms up on my shoulders and not feel dysphoria. This is VERY bad. It discounts my entire being. It fucking makes me a fetish!

I have dated a couple transgender women, and was engaged briefly. Things were a MESS. I was proposed to first week.

Last woman I went on a date with, we danced, after speaking for a few days prior and she asked if we were girlfriends.I am monogamous, but I will not be shackled on a first date? No sex? Are you serious?

The considerate part is the second. I am a hopeless, old fashioned, romantic. I get little gifts. I was buying truffles, running baths by candelight, serenading with my uke and singing, cooking, sneaking little love notes in glove boxes, and I have fulfilled the needs of those I have been with, who are not reciprocating.

I have yet to meet one person who is sweet.

They can debate with me science, and philosophical things, and they love that I love sci fi or whatever, but that is not a connection. Being a loving, giving, human is.Cisgender women have all stated I am too tall.I am the only cisgender woman I know of in my area who is 6'2"".HEIGHT is the last lesbian cisgender prejudice. Articles are written about it. Do not deny it.

‚Äã

Men ask me out all the fecking time and it is getting sooooooo old.

I am told I will find the one, or at least someone, that is good to me, when I least expect it.

I have been volunteering for years, and going to meetups and I google articles ""why am I single?"" and why can I not meet anyone, and I think it is due to my age. Not that I am not willing to date younger (I have, the youngest about 8 months back was 29 when we first met), but I feel my life is mostly in order, and those younger are discovering themselves despite what jobs they have, and that is cool, but I am beyond that point..I like to go out and have fun, but not fall over drunk on a bar stool. That holds no value to me.

I cannot go on another date. It all feels the same. All of it, every time, it feels the same, except for one recently, but it was still structured and contrived.

I have been online dating for ten years, and I have met people who have lied, hid things from me (like excessive things) and while I place none of that on the next person, in the same breath, I am exhausted. I have taken , at most, one year off at a clip, more than once, from going on any dates or entertaining anything romantic.

I have to think I am the common denominator in all of this. I have discussed it in therapy. I was advised maybe to move to the coast, but I heard, and no offense, that many there enjoy the demographic that is 5'1"" dark hair (do I need to say it??!)  I am a tall white ginger. There it is. I was told I would be even more lonely now (moving to California).

I am also not poly, and that seems to be all the rage as of late. I do not judge those who are, and not saying it is a bad thing, it is just not for me.

I just got back from a studio recording session, which was pretty cool.

I was asked out this weekend for my birthday. What, go to another restaurant? Again?I would rather binge watch Netflix (which I am about to do).

Got called out at work for not being smart enough - and I can't help but relate it to my identity and my queerness,"So yesterday I found out one of the senior bosses in my work thought that I might have not looked smart enough for a workshop I did for a client (at their site).

This has brought up a lot of things for me and I'm unsure how to approach any resolution to it. And I feel like it's related to my queerness and my personal identity.

Firstly - I don't really ""do"" smart. My style is active wear, baggy hoodies, tshirts and boots. So smart definitely doesn't come naturally! But I know when it's appropriate and when it's not.

I used to be very much the ""typical butch"" when it came to smart-wear. Trousers, shirt and shoes. But I don't really identify as butch and I got tired of people mis-identifying me because of my clothing... So I try not to wear shirts much unless it's a super super oversized fashion situation. Plus I have big boobs and finding a flattering fit is hard!

On the other hand, I do have some dresses! But on this work occasion I was doing some pretty practical hands-on work (even though it was with a client) so I didn't want to flash anyone! 

In this type of conundrum I'm always a blazer girl, but guess what! When it's 30 degrees and you're doing active work, again blazers can be a bit much...

I found myself in this predicament and went with a black fitted t-shirt, trousers and shoes. For me I very much looked smart. But I wasn't smart enough? 

I've spent my whole life being judged at face value. I used to have short hair - so I was butch or even a guy. I used to have pink hair - so I was a ""rebel"" or would ""misbehave"" (even when I was top of my class). And now I have visible tattoos. 

I have never doubted my ability to do my job, my intelligence. And I was told that my senior boss had ""great words to say about how I interacted with the client and the job I did"". But apparently I still wasn't smart enough and that matters? 

It's a very frustrating situation because my personal identity is part of how I dress. My queerness is affected by how I dress. (Though just to note there are lots of out people at work so it isn't trying to hide my identity, but embrace it). The question is, how do I balance this in the workplace?  ...I guess that's what I have to figure out! ",actuallesbians

"Is femsexuality a valid sexuality? If I'm attracted to someone who looks like a binary woman but is a trans man, am I no longer a lesbian?","I've been told time and time again that femsexuality ""isnt a thing"". This is very complicated but I see femsexuality as being attracted to all people who appear like a binary female would, to simplify, let's say the binary female gender = femininity. So I'm attracted to people who look feminine and ""pass"" as women, regardless of their gender identity or sex. 

For example, if I'm attracted to someone as feminine and resembling of the female gender as say, Ariana Grande, and then Ariana comes out as a (obviously non binary) trans man (since trans men can wear makeup and be feminine and still be men), to be a lesbian I'm supposed to just stop being attracted to (him?) because he identifies as a man, so saying I'm a lesbian doesnt work anymore apparently. This is like a paradox I swear.

That's why I think femsexuality fits. A person can say they're whatever gender they want, that doesn't change the fact that they look like a woman and I'm attracted to people who look like women, therefore I'm attracted to them. Since lesbian is apparently (??) attraction STRICTLY to the FEMALE GENDER, I guess I'm not a lesbian anymore.

I'm attracted to people who LOOK like women, regardless of if that's actually how they identify. I think this should be what qualifies as lesbian but to my knowledge it doesn't because everything is about gender identity now regardless of whether someone conforms to binary or not and looks the part. ?

 Saying I'm bi doesn't feel right because I'm not attracted to the binary male. Gender and gender non-conforming has gotten so complicated. I wish I could be attracted to someone who appears to resemble the binary female gender without worrying about what their gender is. But I guess that's not lesbianism anymore, and I don't believe it's bisexuality, nor pansexuality.

It's FEMSEXUALITY. Right?? But apparently that's not a thing?? My head hurts. What do yall think. Can I still identify as lesbian at this point?",actuallesbians

To future me and future you.,"You'll read this in a different place, at a different time, with different people and a different mindset.

I'm you from the past.

Insecure, unsure, swamped by transphobia, trying to fit in to a puzzle that's more like a maze with no way out.

Trapped in a town that feels outdated, archaic and out of place.

Hopefully you'll be on your way to changing your life for the better.

Maybe a nice little house somewhere with a cat, music, tv shows, movies, fresh garden and a neighbour not in sight.

Alone just like you planned, trying to grow on your own, growing up, shedding former mistakes, maybe you're bitter about the one that got away, a friend that said it just would be better if seperate ways were taken.

Maybe you still long for companionship, a nice young lady to compliment your quaint little cozy home.

What is it you really want?

You surround yourself with what you love but I could see plain as day that it wasn't enough, no matter how often you watched Steven Universe, if you didn't have someone else to share in the gems adventures, it just wasn't the same.

Nothing was enough and you couldn't escape your thoughts, they seeped in to your dreams and rendered your only sanctuary useless.

You were developing in to this independent woman who had to fight for her freedom and basic respect.

Nobody was along for the ride.

Why were you afraid to let someone else in?

Were you holding on to abandonment issues you couldn't control?

Nobody knew that was going to happen.

You have abandonment issues, I get it, people leaving sucks.

But at some point, you need to rise above and overcome, move on and accept that that person who did a very bad thing is not coming back.

You know deep down that you are better off without him, you became more than he could've dreamed of.

She is out there with love to give, care to provide, smiles to shine, heart to beat, intuition in spades, butt to oogle, she's got everything you ever wanted to once be and now be with.

Don't run from someone and something you never wanted so bad.

Take a chance.

Your heart might get broken, but just like every time before, you will survive.

Read this in the future, missy.

You'll be glad you did.

why did I try talking to men again?,"serious question.

i tried talking to a guy. okc matched us because he is trans. (I don't really get OKC's algorithm lol. i get he's part of the lgbt+ community but it doesn't mean that I'd like to talk to men.)  But I was like, you know, for a guy, he still seems nice. So I went ahead and chatted with him for a while. We actually vibed quite well??? Within a day we were off the app. I was like, I actually think a guy is cute? I usually find fictional characters and celebs more attractive and interesting than any man I could meet in real life. I was thinking of having a first date soon as we had been talking and even flirting all day for a while now.

Among other things though, he just seems to have weird communication problems where he goes from sounding like a dick to an absolute saint afterwards... Topped off by him saying I was a virgin yesterday, because I'd never taken dick before (the fuck? that's just so ... homophobic and... sigh). He then became almost manipulative because me being upset about that had upset *him*. He told me I ""wasn't helping \[him\] feel better."" Like what? that's my job now? You made me upset and I have to lick your self-inflicted wounds for you?

I've felt so weird and conflicted, and up until this morning, I took it as ""no, he just must be very special. for someone who likes one guy every 7+ years, he's the special case!"" No. I'm just thirsty I think. And I'm settling for way too little.

He slowly but surely has tried to enter everything in my life. It's too much for someone who hasn't gone on one date yet. He watches almost all my streams, and has twice now tried to find ways to call me (and it's very boring to call him. I'm the kind of person that likes to talk to many friends at once and not do 1 on 1 calls unless they must be.) Like he made it out to be like the call is about something serious but then spends the entire time doing whatever. idfk dude.

Every time I have an interaction with a dude on a closer level, it ends up with them being manipulative towards me and playing the victim. tf?

My first real crush on a girl - and lots of confusion.,"Sorry, this is a bit of a novel!

So I‚Äôm 34, and I only accepted that I‚Äôm bi about 2 years ago (before that I identified as straight).  I‚Äôve always been attracted to guys and girls physically, but I‚Äôve only ever dated guys.

Now there‚Äôs this girl.  She‚Äôs gay, about 10 years younger than me and we‚Äôve been good friends for around 6 months now.  Recently, we both came out to each other, which was a huge step for us both as neither of us are out.  Since all that happened, I‚Äôve realised that I have a huge crush on her, but because I didn‚Äôt know she was gay, I just thought I really wanted to be her friend.

This is the first time I‚Äôve really allowed myself to have a crush on a girl and it‚Äôs so confusing and overwhelming.  It feels so different to the time I‚Äôve had crushes on guys, and I find myself comparing her to men and thinking constantly how much I like her more than any guy I‚Äôve ever been with.  And that‚Äôs brought up all this confusion about whether or not I‚Äôm bi or actually lesbian.

I don‚Äôt know if she feels the same way, but she did get super drunk one night and then flirted with me (holding hands, smelling my hair, kissing the top of my head, hugging etc).  But when she‚Äôs sober she won‚Äôt even touch me.  And she‚Äôs young and pretty and really fit, whereas I‚Äôm older and overweight and really nothing special to look at.   I keep thinking that if I told her how I felt, she would be really turned off and maybe not want to be my friend anymore.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do.  I want to be with her all the time, but I‚Äôm so scared of the rejection.

Ghosted by a girl I've been seeing almost 2 months,"We met on OKC. She messaged me first and lives about an hour away. I'm new in town so I was fine with the distance.
She (30) and me (28) hit it off and would see each other every week for a couple months. She even would tell people I'm her ""almost girlfriend"". I met some of her friends, we would spend the night, we would chat all the time. She came out of a long term relationship a couple years ago, has her shit together, and I thought this was someone I could be with.
This week? Silence. It's been hitting me hard. I've gotten one reply out of her and it was basically saying ""Sorry been playing wow"". This is obviously a lame excuse and I know better. I know she's into gaming but not enough to ignore me for a week when we would see each other and text regularly before.

I'm going back to my hometown for a month and she hasn't even cared to set a date, even though it was understood we were supposed to. Hasn't responded to messages.
My last one was a couple days ago just to try one last time: ""Friendly reminder I'm out of here in 4 days. Up to you"".

I've backed off and it's up to her now. But dang it hurts, because even if we didn't work out, I could see us being good friends and now there isn't even that. I am disappointed because I thought she was more mature. Its painful to think the last time I saw her was the last time ever.
Unless she resurfaces in which I have more self respect than that..

Need words of encouragement.

"Will she ever change, come out, or feel comfortable being with me?","My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now. We love each other!! FYI: I am not her first girlfriend!!

Some of her friends know about us and that she is bisexual. With that group, we‚Äôve all hung out, show PDA, etc. The other half, or about 70%, of her other friends do not know about us or her sexuality. Also her very conservative and religious parents don‚Äôt know her sexuality or about me. 

We recently had a convo about how she feels like she can never tell them about me or her sexuality. Both her parents and friends are extremely conservative and will not take the news well, she thinks. This has created some tension because I‚Äôd love to be invited when she goes out with her conservative friends, just to charm their pants off and keep my hands to myself, but I never am and I don‚Äôt think my gf will ever be comfortable inviting me. She even changes my name in her phone to a guy‚Äôs name when she goes out with them :/. After our convo, she says she knows she needs to make some important decisions. 

Is this a lost cause? Are we going to end up dating  for years and nothing will change? I‚Äôd hate to have her choose or anything but I‚Äôm feeling kind of nervous that things will always be like this. 

Tldr: most of gf friends don‚Äôt know about us, she doesn‚Äôt want to tell them, makes me nervous she never will

Am I lesbian or just scared of men?,"For context, I'm a young adult who grew up evangelical. While my parents were fairly liberal as far as evangelicals go, encouraging me to educate myself and be independent, I still wasn't fully protected from some of the more radical ideas on womanhood. I'm still fighting with the idea that my body is my own, and doesn't belong to anybody else. I'm trying to untangle myself from the idea that my life isn't my own to live, but is ultimately destined to be part of a man's. I've never dated men, because I'm scared of them. I've had this premonition numerous times that I'm going to marry a man I'm not attracted to, and regret it bitterly.
However, I have had feelings for girls that I haven't really had for men. Stupid gushy feelings. I see a pretty girl and stop and stare. I've practically hyperventilated over a female friend holding my hand. I look at all my female friends, and they're all so cute in different ways, while men all just seem rather ugly. While I like male fictional characters, the few feelings I've had in real life seem to be directed towards girls. And a part of me wonders if I'm conveniently manufacturing these feelings to avoid what I've always felt is going to be my fate, but for some reason, the idea of being a lesbian has a strange sort of pull? Like it's where I belong? I don't know. I don't like these questions, because they make me have to rethink everything I thought I've known, but better figure it all out before I do something rash and potentially wreck my life.",actuallesbians

I need an editor for my erotic lesbian stories,"Hey, ladies,

my name is Svenja. I am a 28y-old lesbian from Germany.

One of my hobbies is writing erotic lesbian stories - mainly on [literotica.com](https://literotica.com), but recently I also published my first e-book.

So far I have published all my stories only in German, because it is my mother tongue.

But I was often told that I should translate my stories into English to reach a larger audience.

I have already started translating one of my stories, but I think that my ""school English"" is not good enough to be published without further editing by a ""native speaker"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, to cut a long story short:

I am looking for someone who speaks ""native"" English and is willing to edit my translated stories (no need to speak German!).

She should not only pay attention to spelling mistakes, but above all make it sound as if it were written in fluent, good English.

Unfortunately I don't earn much money with my erotic stories - so there's not much budget for an editor.

But maybe I can find someone here who likes to read and edit erotic lesbian stories and help me?

So, if you are (seriously) interested, please contact me!",actuallesbians

One of my guy friends has been trying to get me on Reddit for a while now, and I kept just brushing it off because how many social media platforms do I need?!? Also I feel old for this group but I‚Äôm not really old (31) Anyway, I am sooooo happy I am here! 

I made an account last night, and got caught down the rabbit hole of Reddit. It was amazing.. I feel like I sort of have the hang of it. Minus the Reddit lingo... ?!
This group is where I will spend most of my time - IF you‚Äôll have me!! 

My wife and I were technically both straight when we met, we were each other‚Äôs firsts.. and it happened when I was 24 and she was 29 so we both already have great solid established friend groups. Only negative is that they are all straight and I need to gay up my life a little more! I have been desperately craving friendships with other gay women or other lesbian couples. We live in a decent sized town that is somewhere in the middle on the political spectrum, but I don‚Äôt see a lot of lesbians, or couples. 
This sub is where it‚Äôs at and as I read it for hours last night I felt so normal! 

So thank you for existing! I‚Äôm so sad I‚Äôm so late to the reddit game, but excited at the same time that I‚Äôve discovered it!

I will be commenting and contributing a lot, and was wondering if there are other subs you all think I should join. I‚Äôve found my fair share of lgbt subs so far, but this one is by far my favourite.

Ps. Sorry this is so long, and all over the map!",actuallesbians
But why?!,"I need to vent. 

I‚Äôm tired of straight men and their attitudes. I‚Äôm tired of my sexuality being less I guess ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù then theirs. I‚Äôm tired of my sexuality being seen as ‚Äúless than‚Äù 

I recently came out more. I‚Äôve been out as open/pan sexual for about 11/12 years. For a long time it was- ‚Äújust have sex with a women- see if it‚Äôs in your head‚Äù because people made me feel like liking both had to be for attention.. but then I did. And I loved it. It was a totally different experience than being with a man. With men- it‚Äôs all about me. But with women- it‚Äôs about her. With men, I just let them do what they want. If they want to stop at making out fine, if they want more- I let it happen. But with women, I initiate. I want it. 

Anyway. After being with a women it became ‚Äúdate a women for 6+ months- see if it‚Äôs just sex you want‚Äù. And I haven‚Äôt actually dated a women that long still. But I realized recently- I don‚Äôt need to. I don‚Äôt like men. I can find them beautiful. I can enjoy sex with them because let‚Äôs be real- pleasure feels good. I can love hanging out with them. But there is always something missing (beside two men)- which is why I can‚Äôt say fully 100% that I‚Äôm gay. But I can say I am way way more gay than anything else. 


Anyway- now the thing that pissed me off today. I recently told my friend ‚ÄúJames‚Äù. I‚Äôve known James for over 7 years and he‚Äôs always known that I like girls. But today- he tried to define my sexuality. And I am NOT okay with it. 

First he told me he deserves women more than I do because he‚Äôs straight. Like women are something you can earn? Like it‚Äôs a prize that you deserve to get? 

Then he told me ‚Äúif you like women, you would not like dick if I‚Äôm not mistaken‚Äù followed by ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to like men emotionally‚Äù - for one, you can like both. Two, if I‚Äôm not emotionally interested in men- I don‚Äôt like men. 

And then he had the balls to say ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt gay if you like dick as much as you do. Bi yes‚Äù 
He does NOT get to tell me I‚Äôm not gay. Whether I am or not- this is my fucking journey and only I can define it. He doesn‚Äôt know how I feel about dick, he isn‚Äôt in my mind. I explained to him multiple times that yes, I‚Äôve slept with men and yes it feels good but no, I don‚Äôt like them. There is almost always something missing. End of story. Who the fuck does he think he is?! 

End of rant. 

Tl:dr

We are in high school and haven‚Äôt been in relationships before. We aren‚Äôt extremely close friends because we haven‚Äôt known each other for very long. We‚Äôve been asking each other a lot of questions and getting to know each other. How will I know if we have a connection? Do I even want a connection? Is this how people start relationships? I want to hold her hand and be near her but I don‚Äôt know if she wants that of if she would be uncomfortable. I‚Äôm not even 100% sure if she wants a relationship. I‚Äôm so nervous about talking about this kind of stuff to her.

I‚Äôm scared that we caught feelings for each other too quickly and that it‚Äôs just a stupid temporary emotion that will go away in a week. I‚Äôm really scared about telling friends if we get more serious, because they know that me and her have crushes, but not on each other.

I know a lot of people aren‚Äôt like this but I just don‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôm just afraid of people judging me and her and it makes me wanna cry.

"She's hot and cold with the flirting, should I ask why?","I met a woman last year, she was pretty flaky and bailed on plans a lot, but we texted every day and things were very flirtatious. But there's almost a two hour drive between her town and mine, so we only saw each other a few times, and nothing physical happened. She ended up ghosting and I was heartbroken, but then she got back in touch a couple of months later.

Since then we have been more open with each other. We slowly worked our way back up to texting each other every day, and things became flirtatious again. I finally saw her again and we kissed briefly, but it was kind of a spur-of-the moment thing and we both ended up casually kissing multiple women that night. Not too long after, we both confessed to having feelings for each other, and the flirtation seriously escalated. I've sent her naughty pictures, she's sent me explicit texts. We've both expressed hesitance to actually date each other because of various personal issues and because of the distance, but we generally text a fair amount each day, like we're girlfriends. 

Lately she hasn't been flirting though? And has either been oblivious to, or has deliberately ignored a couple of attempts at flirting on my part. She recently had some anonymous person try to mess up her reputation by contacting people she's close to and telling them about her sexual activities, so she said she hasn't felt very sexual lately. So I get that, but at the same time, she hasn't even flirted in a non-sexual way (like saying I'm cute or that she wished I were there so we could cuddle, things like that). Would it be weird to ask her why? I don't want to make her uncomfortable or put pressure on her, but I'd like to know where I stand with her. It's probably not a good idea for us to try to date, but if she wanted to, I'd still like to have a casual physical relationship with her.

Looking back I was totally in love with her but I just couldn't fathom the idea of me falling in love with another girl. And I was so dense and useless.

*Here's the list of signs my stupid ass missed:* she always held my hand, hugged me, kissed me (not on the lips though), hung out or talked with me 24/7, always wanted to physically pick me up, wanted me to lay on her, she would lick me(? Okay this might just be kinda weird lol),tell me I'm perfect and beautiful, we said I love you all the time, and whenever I slept over at her house she would talk about being lonely and wanting to cuddle someone. I assumed she wasn't talking about me and got offended because ""apparently I wasn't enough for her"" And I would tell her to get a boyfriend. (I was the type of closeted gay to talk about platonically marrying my best friend instead of a man) I also would get embarrassed and tell her I don't want to look gay when she tried to hold my hand in public. 

Yikes, I know. And I knew she was bisexual this whole time too. I feel awful for how I treated her, and also that I missed my chance and I could've dated her and been so happy if I wasn't in such denial about my sexuality. 

She stopped talking to me like a year ago (i was totally heartbroken) and I think I now understand why. She has reached out to me a few times and I tried to keep talking to her but she eventually just ghosts me again. Half of me wants to be the one to reach out and see if it'll work, but the other half of me feels I should just move on and run from my embarrassment (I did a lot of other embarrassing things while sad and confused about how I felt) Besides, as far as she knows I'm still aggressively straight. It'd be weird for me to just pop back in her life even gayer than she is. Also I'm pretty sure she's online dating this other girl right now? Idek I'm a terrible person ",actuallesbians

Looking for body positive lesbian art.,"I'm in the beginning of a long distance relationship with this girl. One of the ways I found to connect with her is to send her very cheesy art of lesbians kissing and cuddling. The problem is that most of what I find is with girls of the conventionally attractive skinnier body type. I think my girlfriend is beautiful but she gets very self conscious about her weight. I'm wondering if some of you know artists who draw queer women in a more body positive way.

Mouth piercings and split tongues...bedroom issues/benefits?,"Semi-racy question but genuinely need some feedback on this as it may influence my choices (a little) and not sure how to put it subtlety so gonna be a blunt gal! 

So... any ladies with the following piercings (my last set have finally healed so getting more!). Do any of them cause issues when going down on a gal? I could see the medusa/cyber bites perhaps getting caught or nicking somewhere if my um.. face is deep (I do not know how to say this subtlety). Not sure if the others would cause issues due to the placement. 

* -Medusa on it's own 
* -Cyber bites (medusa and labret in a pair)
* -Dahila bites (edges of each side of mouth)
* -Angel bites (both sides top of mouth)
* -Snake bites (both sides of bottom of mouth)
* -If you have any other face piercing that caused problems though id be pretty curious (looking at collecting a lot of them!). 

Also I am considering getting a split tongue. Anyone with a split tongue or having been intimate with someone who has one (or shared stories about with a friend with one?!), does it make things better or worse pleasure wise? Any other notes on how that changes the game? 

Also a question for everyone reading even if you have no experience of it, would you be freaked out or interested (or neutral) by the idea of a girl with a split tongue, both in general and bedroom wise?

I‚Äôm tired of not having anyone to hold: the closet is killing me.,"Bear with me. 

So I‚Äôm in high school, and I‚Äôve accepted my identity. I see no problem with me loving girls. 

But the people around me do. If I come out it‚Äôs inconceivable what could happen. I‚Äôm not as unlucky as some LGBT+ folk, I live in America, but my location in the States is what screws me over. Small town USA. Yee Haw. 

All I do is fantasize about girls. I‚Äôve had so many crushes I can‚Äôt keep count. Im very playful, my personality in general is, so a lot of times girls mistake  what I see as clear flirting for just me being me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm the only teenager alive that hasn‚Äôt had anyone have a crush on them before, considering I‚Äôm pretty good looking, well groomed, dress nice, and outgoing. (Not bragging;I try take care of myself) 

I just want someone so bad. I don‚Äôt care, if it‚Äôs short lived and meaningless, or long term and sincere. I want to experience high school romance like the rest of my peers and friends. 

And everyone can sit back and say ‚Äúwell not everyone experiences a relationship in high school that‚Äôs straight!‚Äù, yeah you are right. But they have the freedom to. Pursuing someone for them doesn‚Äôt bring up the possibility of bullying, being cut off from family, and even death threats. It does for me. 9/10, if a straight person isn‚Äôt dating in highschool, it‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt interested. 

I sit back and watch my girl-friends get treated despicably by guys. Although I don‚Äôt have romantic feelings for the most of them (haha), I can‚Äôt help but sit back and thing about how thankful I would be just to have them. How I would do everything differently. How I would go over the moon for someone. 

It‚Äôs so unfair. It really is. Being gay is such a silly personality trait for a whole country to be divided on it. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do.

"It's time for another useless lesbian moment! (Advice, pls)","Alright y'all, look, I've got yet another useless lesbian moment for you.  Buckle up, buttercup, 'cause it's a long one.  I'll just drop it on you, now:

I really like my best friend.

Now, before you roll your eyes and sigh and say, ‚ÄúJUST ASK HER OUT, THEN!‚Äù, let me explain why I'm a useless lesbian and need help in this situation.  For starters, Friendo and I have been friends since December.  We met by complete happenstance in public and just rolled with it.  Initially, I'd thought she was cute (of fucking COURSE), but she kept casually mentioning her boyfriend all night, so I immediately stashed her away as a strict friend and that's been that.

Well, kids, over the last few months, our friendship has . . . grown?  Blossomed?? Developed??? Hit me like a ton of bricks????  and I don't know what to do with it.  We spend a lot of time together: we go to a lot of concerts together, we travel a lot to said concerts together, we watch movies a lot together, we get shitfaced a lot together, we get high out of our fucking skulls a lot together . . . and we've been asked how long we've been together a lot.  Most recently, she invited me to her friends' wedding as her plus one and three separate people asked how long we'd been seeing each other.  THREE.  Friendo's latest ex boyfriend even confessed when they broke up that he was jealous of me because we were always together.  Once early in our friendship, she mused about how much money she's going to make when she's completed her certifications and I joked that I was going to marry her for her money; she enthusiastically nodded and said yes.  I've met all of her friends in her hometown and she's met my parents and slept in my childhood bed with me (we were literally just sleeping, I promise!!)  I mean, friends do all that stuff together, right??

There was a specific instance that sparked this flame, for me at least.  One night a couple weeks after Pride (which we also attended together), we got a little drunk as we are wont to do, and I don't recall how, but the conversation turned to weddings--OUR wedding in particular. I'm not joking, we planned out who was invited, what we'd serve to eat, who would play as the band, what kind of venue we'd have, what our rings would look like (‚ÄúYou can have whatever you want!‚Äù she says), what our dresses would look like . . . and then we moved on to our future together.  We discussed how many kids we'd have and what their names would be, who gets to carry first, how many pets we would have and what their names would be, too, and even right down to what kind of house we'd buy.  This is all going to happen if I'm single when I turn 30 (three years from now).  My guys, we had it all laid out.  We parted ways smiling like idiots that night.  I think that may have also been the same night in which she coyly tried to invite me over using free parking passes as a bribe (never mind the fact that I'd already been to her place a million and a half times by then) and I flirted back that I was in an open relationship.  But like the useless lesbian I am,  I laughed it off and said I had to work early and we both went home alone, me believing that we were just having a giggle as friends do.

I woke up the next day, unable to get the idea of a future with Friendo out of my mind.  Every damn day since, I've fantasized over what we've talked about and what it would be like to be her wife.  It's been almost three months since that night.  There was a hot minute at the beginning of this month where she thought her work contract wouldn't get renewed and she'd have to move away, so she started looking for apartments, ‚Äú'Cause you're coming with me, right?  One bedroom or two? ;)‚Äù

SO Y'ALL . . . I'm useless because I can't tell if this girl LIKES me or not!  I mean, we made a marriage pact for Jesus Henry Christ's sake!  But does she like me?!  Does a marriage pact mean there's some degree of truthfulness to it??  Am I absolutely daft and missing crucial signs that this chick is into me?!  I don't know!  Friendo claims she's pan and has had a girlfriend before, but she's also had a husband before.  What are the chances that she actually wants to have a relationship with ME of all people! Her work contract did end up getting renewed, so I have her until November.  What should a useless lesbian do?  Is it really that obvious?  How in the world do I go about asking her if there was any meaning behind the marriage pact without obliterating our really enjoyable friendship?

TL;DR:  I'm a useless lesbian because I can't pick up on basic social cues that my friend likes me, even though she's (drunkenly) agreed to marry me (twice).",actuallesbians

Communicating during sex! Help!,"I NEED YOUR ADVICE: I started seeing a new girl a week or so ago and things have been going AMAZING. We tried waiting to have sex (her definition is ‚Äúanything that makes you cum‚Äù but little does she know she already made me cum the first night we met lol) but two nights ago we said ‚Äúfuck it,‚Äù literally I guess, and had sex. 

I knew she is dominant, we made out and fooled around before. Prior touching during monkey business included: typical dry humping, pulling her hips closer to mine while grinding, rubbing her clit over her pants, massaging her breasts. She seemed to enjoy all of those activities, they riled her up in a good way. 

HOWEVER, after we had sex, specifically the day after, she was not happy. I did everything I did before, except this time I initiated the monkey business.  I asked for consent for everything I did and received approval every time. I did all of the things I had done before (she didn‚Äôt take off her pants but we dry humped and she fingered me). She had been weird with me since and today I finally got her to communicate what was wrong. She said she‚Äôs never been with a girl who also initiates and doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúbeing grabbed or reached for.‚Äù The sex started by cuddling so there was no real grabbing? 

I am very experienced communicating during sex. I‚Äôm getting the impression that she isn‚Äôt though. How do I help her become more communicative? I apologized to her profusely about the other day and cutely said I want to have sex in a way that pleases her, so please communicate her needs. She seemed fine with it, but I want to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again

TLDR;  How do I get her to communicate more while we‚Äôre having sex? How do I encourage her to talk about when it‚Äôs ok to touch her vs. when it‚Äôs not? Does anyone have any insight to these kinds of preferences? She‚Äôs very good at dirty talk, but it‚Äôs mostly about what she wants to do to me. Any ideas about how I can use that ability to my advantage??

Dating in the closet?,"Late last year, I got out of an abusive relationship, and, having no friends I could ask for help (and absolutely no money either, for that matter), I ended up moving back in with my parents. I've since gotten a stable job, and have been seeing a therapist for several months to work on my anxiety and other related issues.

Since I was 12, I've identified as bisexual, because I knew I liked women, but I wanted to believe I could marry a man and just live a ""normal"" life. I've never been able to make it work though, because I'm simply not attracted to men, and I've slowly been coming to grips with the fact that I'm gay, not bi. 

My therapist suggested that dating, even casually, may help me feel more comfortable with that part of my identity. However, I don't have enough of a financial safety net to move out yet, and I'm not out to my parents‚Äînor will I be until I'm independent again. Since I'm more interested in dating than hookups, I would feel really scummy not being upfront about this stuff, but at the same time, I feel like no one in their right mind would want to date a closeted, 23 (almost 24) year old woman still living with her parents.

What Can I Do For You?,"(Insert Steven Universe Reference)

Ahem.

-Anyway, on the off chance she‚Äôll see this, I‚Äôm wondering what I can do to help my younger sister out. (I‚Äôm sorry if you stalk me on Reddit bro.) 

We moved into an apartment together about a month ago. So far it‚Äôs going really well. She is still job hunting, but I know she‚Äôs really close to getting hired for something.

That‚Äôs not my worry. I‚Äôm worried about my sister‚Äôs social/personal growth.

Right now, she is seriously questioning her gender. I‚Äôve known this for awhile. She‚Äôs never had sex or a relationship, and she tells me this is because she doesn‚Äôt like the way she looks/feels in and about her body. She expresses interest in wearing a suit, dresses mostly comfortably/masculinely, but sometimes enjoys wearing skirts. Never makeup. Doesn‚Äôt really express interest in male pronouns.

She isn‚Äôt sure if she is trans or not, but has mentioned seeing a therapist in town that specializes in gender . So far, I haven‚Äôt seen her put much effort into reaching out for that kind of help. I worry she never will, but she says she may try after she starts working.

My sister is an extrovert, but she has social anxiety and is afraid to put herself out there. I am worried about her staying home and not engaging with others. She says she is happy, but I really just yearn for her to get out there and live her life to its fullest, and learn more about herself and her gender.

Is there anything I can do to encourage her to thrive? I just want her to be happy. I know she has to be ready herself to go out, but I want to do everything I can to help. I‚Äôve even mentioned using dating apps as ‚Äúpractice‚Äù for her anxiety around dating, but she doesn‚Äôt seem open to that.

Anyway, we are driving and out of the blue he says ‚Äú You know, you can tell me if you‚Äôre gay, I won‚Äôt be mad.‚Äù Already not the best opening, but he‚Äôs trying. I of course respond ‚ÄúNo‚Äù because I‚Äôm not ready to fully come out to him. However what I wanted to say was

I'm 35 and married to a man. I'm afraid I've missed my chance to be with women.,"I had a few experiences with women in college and shortly after, but nothing went past 2nd base--I think because I was afraid of what it would ""mean"" if I started dating women. (I still don't know what it would ""mean,"" but it seems to matter much less now than as a 20-year-old.) I am attracted to women and had a few crushes, but otherwise I've only dated men.

I've been with my partner now for 7 years, married for 1. We've talked about having an open relationship, but he is only comfortable with me seeing women. Which is great! (but also gives me a weird feeling, like why is he threatened by men but not women?) 

Anyway, my hesitation is that I feel like I'm too old to start exploring this. Or, more specifically, that the people I'd want to date don't have the patience to guide someone through what she should have been through 15 years ago. I see it on this sub sometimes--that bicurious girls are annoying, that they're just going to go back to their boyfriends. And of course having never had sex with a woman, I am afraid I'd do it badly and out myself as *just a virgin who can't drive*.

I'm sure there are lesbians out there who have particular fetishes for ""turning"" straight girls, and that anybody who rejects me for these reasons just isn't right for ME. But I'm wondering how common my situation is and if I should really be worried at all.

Rant About My Brother,"My older brother is egotistical and doesn't believe in romantic love. His views and beliefs are really affecting my life and potential relationships. I'm a lesbian, and it's already hard enough to find girls to date, but he says people who seek relationships are just looking for a distraction, and people who use online dating sites/apps are ""insecure morons"" who are too scared to talk to people in real life. I don't think he has ever been in a relationship, and I definitely haven't. I'm 20 years old, and I haven't even had my first kiss.

I just feel like my brother is trying to make me like him, and is trying to project his views and beliefs onto me. And I'm wondering if I should just give in. I have never had a girl show romantic interest in me before, and I can't really leave the house without my brother interrogating me about who I'm meeting etc and ridiculing me if it's a date, so how could I ever meet anyone? I have postponed or even canceled a lot of dates with people because of my brother.

I just don't know what to do. I can either continue to crave intimacy and love, or just give up and devote my entire life to a career/hobby like he does. I just feel like regardless of which one I choose, I won't meet anyone. I barely even leave the house unless it's to run errands etc because I would have to face millions of questions when I came back :(

The thing that really annoys me about him though is that he is a musician and he's currently learning how to play the piano, and he always chooses old love songs to learn. It frustrates me because these are songs that I really identify with because they remind me of the girls I've liked in the past (and I've always been a hopeless romantic), and I just feel like he's tainting them and ruining them. He's currently learning ""That Old Feeling"", by Chet Baker, which is one of my favourite songs. I know how it feels to see someone after a while and have all of those feelings come flooding back. But to him, it's just a song :/",actuallesbians

My girlfriend has more friends than me and I'm jealous?,"We have been dating since last November and are together since May/June around. I moved to this city last september because university  while she lives here her whole life. It makes totally sense she knows more people and has more friends, but even in my old city I didn't have many friends. I like hanging out with people, but I was kinda outcast my whole life so I was struggling a lot finding the right friends and didn't have a group since 5 years, just people I am friends with individually. Even in uni, I didn't find a group, but I'm changing subject, so I have a new chance. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong, I'm not shy (anymore) and have no problem talking to random people. But most people doesn't seem to be on the same wavelength. I tried to get into the queer scene but almost everyone is so young (I'm 20, the people there are mostly between 15-18), I kinda missed people my age, I don't get where they are. I have three best friends but all of them live abroad right now. 

The problem now is I'm really jealous that my gf always had good friends and doesn't quiet understand me in my loneliness. She had great birthday parties while I struggled to even find people to spend my birthday with. I like spending time by myself but I'm really not an introvert and feeling like missing out. I try my best talking to people and get to know them but nobody is ever interested in staying in contact.

My birthday is coming up in a month and she's not here because family vacation and it's really depressing me that the person I spend the most time with won't be here on my birthday. i spent my last birthday alone bc none of my friends had time and I feel like the biggest loser.
And I'm scared I'm too emotionally dependend but it's so hard not to be her being the only friend I have around here. I'm happy for her that she is in a better place but I'm afraid I will end being angry at her for being more popular than me and being really toxic.
I really don't know what to do, I hope I find good friends in my new study, but I'm also scared a lot because I fucked up so often.

Sorry for the long post, I really needed to get that off my chest. Has anyone any advice?",actuallesbians

As always... there's this girl...,"I met Allie (not her real name) in April or May when we went on a backpacking trip in a club I'm an  officer for. We didn't hang out the entire trip or anything, and she's very quiet, but I was the only one able to make her laugh or really open up. I also managed to find out she was gay because we both had really similar realization stories at high school dances. We also chatted at a fire alarm at our dorm once and it was so easy to talk to her!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway it felt like we had chemistry but it was bad timing for me. I was going through a really rough break up and talking about my ex a lot, one of my close friends had recently passed away and I was fighting with really bad depression/suicidal thoughts/self-injury. She knew some of that stuff was going on, I didn't talk to her about it directly, because I liked her, but obviously she heard about it because we were all constantly together and there's no privacy in the woods lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been several months now of me focusing on myself. I'm over my ex (I deserve SO much better, honestly). My mental health is in a stable place, I haven't had thoughts of suicide since May and am clean from self-injury. And I really want to see this girl again! 

  
I'm one to take things slow, so I was thinking about waiting to see if she shows up to any of our club hikes before testing the waters and flirting a little bit, then asking her out. I was also considering texting her a little before school starts to ask her how her summer was and if she'd be coming to any of our hikes, but I thought that might be a little weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my biggest insecurity is that she knows about my mental health struggles. As I said I'm stable now and I have a lot to like about me as a partner--I'm considerate, loving, but also my own person as a college student, part-time worker and several hobbies....So anyway, any advice on how to show her I've got my shit together now, and any advice on making a move?

I know it's hard for you not to be perfect and i want you to know, you've been a great mother most of the time, but the harshness you judge other people for their shortcomings whilst not aknoledging your own puts a barrier of resentment between us.

Potential STD maybe?,"NSFW, but I was fingering my girlfriend and then fingered myself but used the same hand for a few minutes on accident from getting caught up in the moment last night.

Neither of us have had HPV shots and I've heard it's usually highest risk of being cancerous later if you've had more partners (she's had around 5 iirc), because of exposures to more strains, and if you have other STD's present. 

 I went to my OBGYN routine exam a few months ago and they said everything seemed fine besides a yeast infection and a very minor bacterial imbalance that was possibly BV both of which are cleared up now by medication.

how much chasing and clear expression is required of a lesbian before stuff becomes endless small flirting that leads to nowhere??,"Hey there everyone! I cannot for the life of me be concise so sorry

The thing is, my first and last relationship happened two years ago and it was with a friend of mine so I'm pretty rusty in the dating department. I also haven't really been out with anyone during this time. Flirting and noticing cues from other girls is something I've been getting back to recently but does it confuse me

Recently, this girl from college randomly butted into a conversation I was having with a friend about the book I'm writing, gave me some interesting perspective on the material and asked me when I would be on campus again. She later randomly found me in the parking lot with friends, sprang in front of me and gave me some texts from one of my favourite authors and told me to read and give it back later.

I kid you not, this is how you make me wet. Since then we've had a few sparse short encounters in corridors until I said fuck it and told her to come have lunch with me. Things did go on pretty smoothly I guess, definitely no problem keeping up the conversation, which mainly revolved around literature and writing. I do sense flirting vibes coming from her, I mean, I interpret those stares and a bit too long hugging as flirting. She did briefly mention a boy who I believe is a friend with benefits and some red alarm rang in my head but whatever. At some point she did mention ~casually~ that I could visit her apartment downtown one day and I literally choked on my food because you girls I didn't have much of a backbone to respond to that

Cut to now, I've borrowed a book from her and vice-versa, there's been short arranged/radom encounters and man do I wanna have long conversations with this girl and see what happens but I kind of told myself I would waut to see if she would ask my number or ask me to go grab something to drink but she hasn't. So my question is do I make a move again to ask her out or what. Because I do feel interest and reciprocation on her part but the girl's just so random. How much do I get to the be the 'chaser' (kinda hate this word but you get it) without going overboard and looking desperate?? My bff is like ""for fuck's sake she asked you to visit her house, make some strong innundo"" but I'm still somewhat shy even though my confidence has been rising so my bad lol

I guess this is it, how much chasing and clear expression is required of a lesbian before shit becomes endless small flirting that leads to nowhere?? ",actuallesbians
Crushes before you realized they were crushes...,"Always hear about people's first crushes after they realized they were gay or the one crush that pretty much made them realize they were gay right away. But what about the other crushes? The ones that you never realized were crushes (from before you knew you liked women) and maybe the ones that very slowly made you realize you were gay... A long time after you first started liking them. 

I thought I was straight until age 22 so obviously I've had a lot of these unknown crushes, what were you guy's experience with them? Also interested if you've ever been able to tell someone else had a gay crush before they did (totally not trying to find out how obvious I was at all.....)

Whenever I had a crush on someone before I realized I liked women I would obsessively want to be better friends with them than whatever our current friendship level was. I'd go way out of my way to help them or hang out with them and would be super jealous whenever they hung out with someone else or, heaven forbid, got a boyfriend.",actuallesbians

"For those of you who like post-apocalyptic novels with gay af protagonists ""Charon Docks at Daylight by Zoe Reed"" is for you","I've been following an artist on Instagram, [lesly.o](https://www.instagram.com/lesly.oh/?hl=en) and she has done several illustrations for [Charon Docks at Daylight by Zoe Reed](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3095130/1/Charon-Docks-At-Daylight) and yesterday I decided to give it a look. It was one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading books that are similar to 28 Days Later and The Walking Dead.

Also Lesly's instagram is full of fantastic illustrations for anyone interested in digital art. ",actuallesbians

Tips on how to enter gay dating world when you aren't sure about sex?,"Hey, throwaway because people know my main. 

I've got a bit of sexuality problem and I wanted to get your advice on how best to explain it to other people. First off, never dated women before. Never been intimate with a woman before. Total newbie. I'm already self-conscious about this and I'm hoping people will be nice but the big issue is that, while I'm sure that I love women romantically, and want to date one and grow old with one, I really am not sure about my actual attraction to them. I've never felt pulled towards a woman like people describe when they see someone they want to fuck. I recently got a dating app and flicking through these pics I'm thinking about dates, I don't think I feel physical attraction to any of the girls I see. I was actually deciding to swipe based on what society decided was conventionally pretty, not me personally going 'damn girl.' 

In other words, I think I'm a gay asexual person. However I'm not sure because I'm paranoid that this is just repression plus society teaches us so many bad things about female sexuality, so I'm definitely not comfortable with taking sex off the table forever. I don't know what my feelings on sex with a girl actually are, I don't know whether I'm one of those people who will be totally disgusted by it or conversely totally love it, or just be quite neutral about it all.  

The thing is that I know there's a lot of negative sentiment towards asexuals in the lgbt community even if its a gay ace person, and I'm really scared of running afoul of that. And while I don't want to mislead anyone if I am indeed genuinely asexual and/or I decide I'm either not interested in sex or its not a priority for me... I feel stuck because I don't know what I am. I want to meet women. I want to date them. I want to try having sex with them. But I don't know how to explain my worries or my lack of experience with girls. 

(also, and this is a tiny thing but, if you're talking to a girl on a dating app, should you just buckle up and ask if she wants to meet up?)",actuallesbians

I think I messed up and I don't know how to fix it,"Well I asked the girl I'm seeing if she wanted to be official after a month of talking. We went on dates, met each others families, spent a couple of nights together, she sent me flowers before classes started, listened to heavy metal together- the usual romantic things. 

We spent the weekend together and I told her I really enjoyed spending time with her and I wanted to date her, but if it was moving too fast I understood and I would slow down. She ignored the question and changed the subject. 

Then she stopped talking to me, canceled us hanging out, and won't acknowledge me if I say something sweet. I apologized for making things weird and she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. 

If I'm going too fast I just need to know, if she wants space I'll back off and leave her be. I know somethings wrong but she won't tell me whats upsetting her. I've always tried to be 100% honest with her about my feelings and her silence is frustrating. 

I genuinely care about her and just want her to be okay. Over the weekend I realized I was falling hard for this woman and I want to be with her in anyway I can but I have no idea if I should just leave her alone for a few days or keep trying to have a relationship with her. Per my last post I'm a baby gay and I don't know what I'm doing in the slightest. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I feel like I have no where to turn. ",actuallesbians
Mild identity crisis,"I hope I've come to the right place for this but here we go...

Is it wrong contacting a girl on Instagram or Facebook that you found on a dating website?,"So, just a bit unsure what to do here. I got a profile on OkCupid, and this cute girl came up. Beautiful and with the most amazing heart. Found out we have so much in common (even more than I had with my ex) and so I sent her a message. Of course the annoying thing is that you can‚Äôt see the profile or message until they answer back. In hindsight it was not a very well worded message, and she is so pretty that I feel it probably is far way down in the list of likes. She shared her Instagram profile and blog url, and was pretty open about who she was. Now, I‚Äôm not good at knowing how long time it takes before one gets an answer on these websites, and frankly this is the first real try at internet dating since my breakup last year from a 10 year long relationship. I don‚Äôt want to seem desperate, like a stalker or creepy, but I also don‚Äôt want to give up without trying. I have found her on Facebook, since her Instagram profile had her real name and all. So, any thoughts. Would it be stupid of me to contact her on Facebook, and reference it to the message I sent on OkCupid? Thanks",actuallesbians

i'm her first girlfriend--intimacy advice?,"I've been dating this wonderful woman I met on OKCupid; we have much in common in terms of interests and preferences, and she's so sweet &lt;3 She's a photographer and I'm a poet, so we've even started collaborating since she attends a graduate program at a high ranking art institute (I know, barf). 

Everything seems great, except during sexy-time. I haven't been able get her off, and it's concerning me because we've slept together about 5 or 6 times now. I've never had this issue of not being able to satisfy my partner, and I've tried a few things like asking her to show me how to touches herself, asking her during and outside of sex what she's into, and trying to ground each encounter with intimacy (touching, kissing, caressing, etc.). Yesterday, we bought a vibrator but she didn't climax. 

She seems genuine when she says she's not bothered and disagrees with me when I say I feel inadequate. She's explained that--frequently--she doesn't actually climax, and then last night she said this was because she's only dated men, wherein those relationships her pleasure was mostly ignored. I don't think she's straight or straight-leaning and just experimenting with me; she's told her roommate and friends she's dating a woman and I believe she cares about me. I just don't know what to do at this point. 

What also makes me feel bad is: I'm HIGHLY sensitive so I'll climax several times... I feel like its so easy to get me off while I can't seem to get her off.  Eek, I'm so embarrassed...

At the time, I was going so we exchanged numbers and agreed to go together. Unfortunately I can't go any more so I let her know about a week ago. I never expected to hear anything from her again so I deleted her number etc, but the other day she messaged me asking if I'm free to meet up anytime soon. I said yes and we have arranged a day to meet. I said I'd take her out for a meal and she told me what kind of food she likes, so I had a look at some restaurants in the city and I think I've found the perfect one and I'm actually quite proud of myself :p But when I told her I had found a restaurant, she didn't ask me where it is or what it's called etc, she just gave me more information about what food she likes/doesn't like haha, so I asked her if she wanted the restaurant to be a surprise (because I thought that would be more exciting :p) and she said yeah.

So basically I'm surprising a girl by taking her to a great restaurant where they serve only her favourite food and I'm not sure if it's a date :D",actuallesbians

"Not gonna be original: I KISSED A GIRL (or rather, a girl kissed me)","Sorry, I have no great romantic story to tell, and there's going to be some blabbering, but bear with me, please, I still gotta share it somewhere and what better place than here

You see, I'm 22 and I have never ever been with anyone of any gender, never even held hands, never even flirted through the internet, nothing (that also has to do with some mental bullshit that I haven't yet decifer, but that's not the point). Not that I'm in a hurry to get in a relationship, more like not at all, but I got some feeling of missing out or something?

This happened like a week or two ago

So I'm at the little party - not even party, really, just four girls hanging out - at my friend's flat. And I must note that this was somehow the one and only group of people with whom I'm comfortable and not nervous hanging out. And that flat is the only flat where I don't want to escape from immediately (besides my own, of course). Dunno what that magic is, but my anxiety calms down around those people and in that place.

So we're all drunk. Like really drunk - but pleasantly, no one got sick or whatever, it was nice. And I don't remember what we were discussing, but I exclaimed something like ""Dammit, and I'm 22 and still haven't been kissed, what the hell, it pisses me off""

And then one of my friends, the owner of the flat - she's pan btw, and also the nicest person in general, the kind of a ride-or-die friend who'd help you hide a body without asking questions - she goes like

""Well shit, I could fix that, if you wanna""

And at this point I'm like. Half ""wait what"" and half ""why the hell not"", so I squeaked something like ""Well I wouldn't be opposed to that"". 

So she did kiss me. And you know what? That was nice. No fireworks or whatever - I guess you have to actually be in love for that - and I didn't do much, since I was both drunk and not experienced at all, but. Yeah. That was really nice. And whatever my inner homophobia tries to tell me, I'm definitely gay. Yay. 

And now that I know the feeling - I'm perfectly content to wait till I meet someone with whom I actually fall in love (and learn how to kiss properly). Without this question buzzing in the back of my head anymore. 

I'm lil gay happy about this, is what I'm trying to say.

(Just in case - yeah, I'm sure that was platonic (do I use the right word?) on her side, no ""useless lesbian"" blindness here. Not gonna go into details, not my life to discuss, but just in case anyone will think that I'm friendzoing her x) Nor am I in love with her. I just trust her. She's that kind of a person.)

Oh, and also - holy hell Katy Perry's ""I kissed a girl"" lyrics make so much sence now!!! The describing parts, anyway.

A little disgruntled... and I don‚Äôt wanna be!,"Hey, guys!

For this one I wanted to post in the Relationships sub, but I dunno - I figure you guys would gimme something better. 

So my girlfriend and her friends (2/3 that I know and get along real well with) have planned a trip to America - a road trip sorta deal. I‚Äôve never been out of the country and have always wanted to go to America, so when I was told no couples/significant others were allowed to go, I was kinda bummed. 

My issue is that I wanna be cool with this - REALLY, REALLY do, because I want her to experience all that great stuff - but, let‚Äôs face it, I‚Äôm jealous and sad, and I can‚Äôt help but resent the trip. I‚Äôve planned my own USA break to try to get over it, but I feel like a huge jackass. I guess I‚Äôm torn because all my friends have told me they‚Äôd be pissed, too, and on some level I feel like a spare dick. We‚Äôve never gone on holiday together where she and her friends have and I guess I figured she‚Äôd use her resources to travel with me, or at least maybe wanna include me in something so life changing/something I‚Äôve always been interested in. It could be that our relationship is still in its infancy or maybe that she hurt my feelings lately when she wasn‚Äôt there for me last week when my great aunt died, which was my first family death. 

The whole thing‚Äôs keeping me up st night and I don‚Äôt want it to. I‚Äôm torn between having a conversation with her about it because it‚Äôs festering or leaving it because I don‚Äôt wanna be an ass. It just seems like she plans more stuff with her friends than she does with me, and I can‚Äôt help but feel hurt. I just want rid of the feelings I have. She‚Äôs also going for three weeks - we‚Äôre pretty inseparable so it‚Äôs gonna be hard. I know it has its perks because I can do lots of stuff alone, but gawd. I dunno why I feel like this.

"It's not just that I love women, but I'm repulsed by men with women, and I feel like that's abnormal.","I don't understand myself.  And this is something I've never really been able to discuss with anyone, because immediately I'm called the stereotypical man-hating dyke.

I'm a 35 year old lesbian.  And I do want to make it clear that I didn't default to women simply because the thought of being with a man makes me feel actually sick.  I actually thought I was into guys - or maybe I was then!  At that age it was all theoretical - as a teenager.   That just kind of went away as I got older, but my attraction to women stayed/got stronger.  

But my feelings aren't just ""Eh, I'll pass,"" or even ""Ew, no.""  The thought of kissing a man, or seeing a man kiss or touch a woman, fills me with this visceral disgust.  However, I don't have this issue when I see two guys hooking up.  I actually love gay porn.  I'm just very specifically repulsed by heterosexual actions.  

I've been romantically attached to two men in my lifetime, and the thing is, the thought of kissing these people I genuinely was in love with (or thought I was; honestly I was in such a bad mental place then it was really probably obsession, not love) turned my stomach.  

I would get it if I were just grossed out by dudes.  I mean, you're not into what you're not into.  But the fact that I find dudes doing other dudes (or themselves) hot, but feel sickened by seeing men touch women, makes me feel crazy.  And sick and abnormal.   

I don't know why I'm asking reddit.  I can't think of anywhere else, I guess.  And maybe in this sub I won't get a bunch of cishet men explaining to me that I'm actually bisexual, not a lesbian.  That's getting old.  ",actuallesbians

While you were closeted,"while you were closeted, did you ever hate or get irrationally or oddly angry at women you subconsciously or consciously found attractive and or liked? Ever ignore or stop talking to them randomly? ",actuallesbians

Desiring a closeted religious bi girl: a heartache in vignettes,"you breathe my name out like a prayer with the lights turned off;  tell me you can‚Äôt want me as you devour my lips like communion wine;  speak your god‚Äôs name as you die over and over again. our legs entwine ‚Äì  thorns in his crown ‚Äì from between both blood burgeons.

&amp;#x200B;

every word after is considered. sorry, you say. sorry you can‚Äôt love  me like a lover can‚Äôt walk away from your creator can‚Äôt embrace sin. in  the night i feel you drifting away on your dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

morning light brings deliverance ‚Äì sins washed clean like your hands  that you pull away from me as if to tidy your hair. you cross the road and keep on walking. you cannot bear to meet my eyes even as you call to me.",actuallesbians

You Guys Are Awesome!,"Since coming to terms with my sexuality I feel like this dark cloud that has been sitting over my head for the last 10 plus years is finally starting to disappear. I‚Äôm happy, like truly happy for the first time in forever it feels like. I would have moments of happiness, but they were never long lasting because I had to deny these feelings and thoughts that I would have. I have been so afraid of these feelings and thoughts and have been pushing them down as far as I can because if I accepted them then It would mean accepting that I‚Äôm a lesbian. And I didn‚Äôt know how to live in my life or with my family and not be straight. I ignored all the signs that I wasn‚Äôt straight because I was scared of how my life would change. Im from a family that has sent members to gay conversion therapy. I‚Äôm not out yet, but just admitting to myself that I‚Äôm not straight is a huge for me. I have ignored all these signs of why relationships with men didn‚Äôt work and realizing that I really didn‚Äôt want to have sex with them and why it felt forced and uncomfortable. Also realizing that  while my friends would crush on men in movies and shows it was always a woman for me. If it wasn‚Äôt for this Sub and The L Word I don‚Äôt know if I ever would have admitted it to myself. I just want to Thank this Sub for what it has done for me! ",actuallesbians
Good Seattle places for queer women?,"I've been a Seattleite all my life and I don't know any good places to meet people, especially other wlw. I've been to the ""lesbian bar"" Wild Rose but it is... not a great time, any suggestions from other seattle lady loving ladies and NBs? ",actuallesbians
How do you feel about lesbians who sexually objectify women?,"I was watching Dead Sara's music video for ""Mona Lisa"" and I was surprised to see scenes of a (skinny/young/white) pole dancer featured throughout. Often with her head cropped out of the frame. It wasn't even like some sort of commentary on objectification (though that's a bad excuse anyway), it appeared to serve no purpose but titillation. Compared to your mainstream male singer I guess it's not a big deal but I kind of expected more from a lesbian-fronted alt-rock band. Is that unfair of me? Idk.

Do you think sexual objectification is ok in lesbian art? Am I just being a kink-shamer?",actuallesbians
How can I tell if someone is into me?,"I'm back with another hypothetical! Add fast as I know, a girl has never really been into me. Though, I suppose it's possible that I just didn't pick up on any signs or hints or anything. So, I guess I would like to avoid missing something? 

Thanks so much for any and all advice!",actuallesbians
Sapphic pendants?,"Fellow leslies! 

I‚Äôm a rather femme gal and I‚Äôve been told I pass as super straight until people actually get to know me. I‚Äôd like to gay it up a bit! 

So I am shopping for some sapphic pendants. Any suggestions from Etsy or elsewhere?

My everyday casual wear is usually high waisted jeans with a tucked in tee shirt and diadora sneakers. I‚Äôm picturing something like a scissoring pendant or low key yoni pendant. I‚Äôm not big on overt rainbow/ colorful jewelry.

my friend needs help,"hello my friend is transitioning and she really likes this girl and is in a relationship that really matters to her (with this girl) and both of them are worried her girlfriend is worried that she wont be attracted to my friend anymore and my friend is worried about the same thing, (she was to shy to make this post so I said I would), is there anyway to make my friends girlfriend like her?",actuallesbians
I really love her,"So I already posted about this topic before but I need to add a little bit more information.

So I have been talking to a girl for 2 months, but she lives in the Philippines and I live in the US. Well today I started to learn Tagalog with help from her. I'm hoping to know how to hold a conversation in Tagalog by the time I'm able to see her in the Philippines.

That is all for now.",actuallesbians

Potential First Girlfriend,"I started talking to this girl on Tinder a few weeks ago. I've met her before at parties but she's always been drunk and just seemed like one of those friendly drunk people. I thought nothing of it. School recently started and we've met up a few times. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but the time we've spent together so far has been great. She shares my sense of humor, weirdness, everything. At the same time, she's so incredibly confident and speaks her mind. She's so secure in herself and I feel her demeanor makes all the difference between being a girl and being a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to a party this past weekend and got pretty drunk/high. I'm still in the closet, but for the first time I didn't care. She held my hand, cupped my face, played with my hair, etc. and everything just felt so right. A lot happened that night and just multiplied how strong my feelings are for her. I got really nervous during sex (not at all confident in my ability to pleasure her. Still freaked out about it and don't know what to do) so she stopped and just held me. I hate admitting this, but I cried. I told her about still being in the closet and how it's not fair to her. About how I was too nervous to be intimate with her. About not feeling like I could ever come out. She just talked and held me until we fell asleep. Like I said, I don't want to get too ahead of myself...but I really feel like she's going to be my first girlfriend. Last night I asked her if I could take her to dinner, so we'll be going this afternoon. 

I never thought I'd be so excited to impress someone. I can't wait to do cute little stuff for her and take her out, etc. I feel like I have so much to offer and really want to show her that. It's so nice for someone to like you as much as you like them. I feel all gushy and it's uncharacteristic of me, but my heart's beating harder just writing this and thinking about how great she makes me feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to earn her love and respect these next few weeks. ",actuallesbians
Conflicting information,"I'm rather inexperienced with pretty much all things romance, including flirting. So, I've been watching videos online and asking around how people flirt. In doing this, I've gotten conflicting tips on one subject in particular. Asking whether or not you can kiss someone. Some people say that it's really good to ask, and others basically say that it's a turn off. I was hoping someone could help me clear this up?",actuallesbians
BFF or Girlfriend?,"Hi all, I need some advice!

So my best friend and I are both queer. We were out celebrating pride weekend with a main goal of meeting people and maybe getting out there and finding relationships, but no matter how we dressed or how hot we looked we weren't getting anyone to dance with. When we made friends over the weekend, we learned that we are essentially twatswatting each other because we look like a couple. 

She's my best friend but I don't want a relationship with her lol. How do we navigate still being able to go out together and also be able to pick up women? 

Thanks!",actuallesbians

"Strongly considering losing my virginity to a woman from Tinder, thoughts?","I‚Äôm a 25 year old girl who hasn‚Äôt had sex yet (I know...late bloomer). I have gone on dates and kissed a girl but the last time it progressed in the direction of sex I panicked.  I‚Äôve been talking to a woman on tinder, she is 30 and in the same field of work as me, and honestly I really like her. 

The thing that sucks for me is I would love to go on real dates but she wants a private friends with benefits type arrangement. She is really patient and seems affectionate though which is good for me.

I have come a long way with my body image and I truly feel ready to have sex, which I couldn‚Äôt say for myself the last time I had the chance to have it. 

I guess I‚Äôm posting here because idk if I‚Äôm completely out of my mind for considering this? I feel like I should be more apprehensive than I am about the whole situation.  The plan is to meet for the first time under regular circumstances and take it slow, not just have a one night stand.  I‚Äôm mostly worried about developing feelings and having my heart broken.

Thoughts from anyone more experienced than me? ",actuallesbians
Any ideas on how to help her smile ...,"Hey guys, I have posted on here before about my own depression hitting pretty hard and just needed some venting - etc... I've come back this time because my lady is having a major bout of depression this time. 

Her sex drive has been slowing down for almost a year and I do blame the Mirena (hormonal IUD, originally placed to help make periods more scarce and less painful). She got it put in last September, and I'm 98% sure that's when our sex life slowed down. A lot. 

I've found a way to deal with my own feelings about her lack of interest in sex; but it's gotten so much worse. Now she is depressed enough, she only wants to sleep. 

I'm worried and struggling and trying to come up with some ideas to get her out of bed and proactive about it... But I'm also worried that if I put too much pressure on her, she will feel worse about not wanting to do things / not being able to. 

Does anyone have some ideas on small gestures or ideas that wouldn't be too much to ask? 

Normally, I would think of my own episodes and what I wouldn't mind doing ; but to be honest, I am almost always strong enough to do what is asked of me, if it is something *she* is asking... 

I dunno. I kind of think asking for ideas is crazy because nobody knows her or me well enough, but I don't know what to do and I'm struggling. I miss her, and she's right here beside me. ",actuallesbians
Dating is feeling like a huge bummer,"I'm just not finding anyone I connect with and haven't in a while. Keep going on dates with no chemistry, no spark or some chemistry but no future. Everything just feels like a big NOT GONNA WORK sign from the universe that makes me want to fold it in all-together. I literally can't even fathom how I would meet someone if I wasn't active in dating or on apps, people who run into their significant others in every day life BAFFLE me. 

Sweater weather is fast approaching and I refuse to be cold this winter by myself. Gonna adopt 6 dogs. That'll fix everything.",actuallesbians
Halo!,"I know this may not be appropriate and if not please just say and I'll happily take this down. 

I'm looking to make a friend, as I'm a lonely lesbian with no friends. I'm F15 and I live in Pembrokeshire West Wales. Anyone wanna be friends? 

I'm starting my second year of GCSE's and it would be nice to have someone to talk to.  I realise how weird this is,  but I'm just looking to make a friend as I'm a depressed, anxious, lonely lesbian. 

Anyway feel free to msg me anyway, if you need to get something off your chest or if you too would like to make a friend. 

If this isn't appropriate for this sub just tell me and I'll take it down. Thanks : )",actuallesbians
Asking Coworker to Lunch..,"How do you as a coworker to lunch without it being weird?

Was trying to explain to my mom I wanted to wear a suit to a wedding,"Me: well it‚Äôs in late October so I don‚Äôt want to get cold. Plus I think I would look good in a nice blazer. 

Mom: well I‚Äôm wearing a long DRESS. If you‚Äôre going to wear a suit at least wear....a frilly top or something

I asked my future sister in law if me wearing a suit to her wedding would offend her and she said obviously no. My brother chimed in and said ‚Äúour dress code is formal, not heteronormative!‚Äù

I love my brother. 

Any suit recommendations? I‚Äôm a newbie. Tall and athletic build with legs that go up to heaven!",actuallesbians
Looking for some advice,"So I started chatting with this girl on OkCupid. I'm 20 and she's 28 if that matters. We were both busy so it was kind of a one message every few days kind of thing, and she'd message again if I didn't reply within a day or two, and then she asked to move to texting and I agreed mostly because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. We met up for coffee yesterday and she seems nice but really clingy and also kind of pushy? Like she's already talking about meeting up again even though I told her I have a really busy week. I don't know if maybe I'm just not as interested as she is? I'm really new to dating, so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong--I figured out I'm gay pretty early (14/15) but I grew up in a homophobic religious environment (my household, churches, private schools, a lot of time in a small Bible belt town) and really internalized the whole ""if you can't pray away the gay, God wants you to be celibate/alone your entire life"" mentality. Just now working through that with a really great therapist at my college. Anyway, that's a bit of a tangent, sorry. I'm just looking for some advice from someone with more dating/relationship experience, I guess!",actuallesbians
