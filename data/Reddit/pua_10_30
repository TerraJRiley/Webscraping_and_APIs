Welcome to the new and improved Pick-up Artists!,"Hello, /r/pua! On behalf of the new mod team, I would like to welcome you all and introduce you to some of the changes we'll be making around here in hopes of improving this already awesome community. 

As a member of the fitness community here on Reddit, we now will only be accepting submissions that involve **weightlifting and body-building**, preferably when it's done with style. I mean, if you're going to pick-up weights, you might as well be an artist about it, right? And that's what this subreddit is all about.

Please be sure to visit and subscribe to our sister subreddits like /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding.

Thanks everyone, and we hope that you'll enjoy these exciting new changes!",pua

This subreddit is fucked.,"It's literally a just bunch of fuckwits circlejerking over nothing. Legitimate question, do the mods actually think this is some insanely hilarious joke? I can't comprehend what's trying to be achieved here other than circlejerking one another in order to forget about how depressing real life is.",pua
