Oh, so I'm racist and have blood on my hands just because I disagree with you about whether blood should be shed because of my fear of immigrants?

[Official] Announcement: A new ask sub for all your questions,"We've been tinkering around here a bit and listening to feedback about all of the advice circlejerks that make their way here. Several people have complained that we keep seeing the same posts *ad nauseum* and we've decided to launch [/r/AskLGBTCircleJerkBros](/r/lgbtcirclejerk) in the coming days to help out where we can.

**Why shouldn't I just go to the old sub?**

A twist: our new sub will also feature mods who are licensed LGBT persons in North America. If you feel like helping out and are a licensed lesbian, bisexual or trans person, please message the mod team directly and we'll mod you up! 

You will have to note, however, that due to the high level of interest, we are currently only accepting gays who have held their non-standard sexuality license for more than two calendar years, or make a one-time cash payment to the [/r/asklgbtcirclejerkbros](/r/lgbtcirclejerk) trademark defense fund. More on that later.

**I hate the mods. Why should I trust them?**

What a stupid fucking question.

I know that I'm the ""patient mod"" but seriously this question is such utter shit. Frankly, I don't really care; this post is just a formality announcing our decision. 

**Aren't you just doing this to wrest control, you power hungry shitlers?!**

Honestly at this point we have no idea why we're doing this. All our previous attempts to monetize /r/lgbtcirclejerk have failed so we're just throwing strategies at the wall to see what sticks.

""I don't know why I didn't think about that before, sorry about that"" the state said apologetically as it expanded basic human rights to all couples regardless of race, orientation, creed, or gender.

When asked why it took so long to have this epiphany the state replied ""Well, you know, it's hard to focus on stuff like this sometimes. I mean, you know how long it took to figure out where to build the new Vikings stadium? These are tough decisions!""

"I'm pretty concerned about hetro-phobia, and would really appreciate you taking the time to read my thoughts.","Yesterday, a man named Joe was assaulted in his own neighborhood, by his fellow man. He was called derogatory names and beaten to the point of needing hospitalization. Why, you might ask, did this happen to him? What was his crime? Simply put, Joe's ""crime"" was being born straight. Where did this take place? You may think medieval Europe, or southern Alabama. No, this horrendous event took place in the Castro District of San Fran. How did his attackers know Joe was straight? We don't. He may have stared too long at a woman's behind. He may have said something that sounded too ""straight"". He may have driven a Ford F150. In any event it doesn't really matter. What matters is a group of LGBT folks decided let their prejudices come forth on Joe that night. ""You straight or somethin? Too bad, I thought you were cute"" said the gay man. ""Are you *trying* to look masc?"" said the dyke. ""I bet you want to do me, don't you straight boy"" said the drag queen. ""You think you're special or something? Just cause you were born with a body that matches your gender identity?"" said the transwoman. The bisexual person said nothing, because they don't exist.  I will spare you the details, except for the fact Joe was found unconscious with in an Ed Hardy shirt, truckers cap, and a bottle of Drakkar Noir poured on him. The word ""st8"" was scrawled on his forehead in pink lipstick, and ""breeder"" on his shirt in neon green nail polish. Joe is doing ok now in the hospital, yet because of institutionalized heterophobia, he is not able to be visited by his wife or their daughter. Current laws permit only those in civil unions extended visitation rights. Because Joe is heterosexual, he had to get married, in a church, and therefore not a state-recognized Civil Union. So please, forward this everyone you know. And remember, on November 6th, please vote YES to define civil unions as being between a one adult and one other adult.

[META] /r/lgbtcirclejerk needs some moderators!,"Hey [/r/lgbtcirclejerk](/r/lgbtcirclejerk)! So we've reached a milestone of 225 readers, and I can't run this thing alone anymore. So I'm looking to install some additional moderators. 

Nominate people for mod in this thread, and at the end of today I'll install my hand-picked co-moderators, whom I've already chosen without input from any of you. 

 \- Joey

EDIT: Wow, it's surprisingly difficult for me to run roughshod over a constituency when so few people actually show up to vote. Anyway, please meet your two newest mods: **RobotAnna** and **airmandan**! 

Anna needs no introduction; as a mod at [/r/KillWhitey](/r/KillWhitey) and third in command at [/r/LGBT](/r/LGBT) she has a truly unique perspective on the 'jerk. She promises in her letter of intent to ""make things way more fun"" and ""only ban if it's funny"". 

Dan is the founder of [/r/firstworldproblems](/r/firstworldproblems) and helps out at many large subreddits, including [/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu) and the SFWPorn network, where just today he [personally tempbanned 976 members of SRS for laughs](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sw89j/and_so_it_begins_pornoverlords_and_affiliated/c4hnt8n?context=1). In his letter of intent he promises ""the bravest bravery that was ever so"". 

I cannot think of a better team to help add an element of chaos and fun to the [/r/lgbtcirclejerk](/r/lgbtcirclejerk) community, and that's why I have hand-selected them for this deeply important role. That, and the fact that they were literally the first two people that asked. 

Anyway, have fun, kids! :-P",lgbtcirclejerk
