</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rage"> Rage </span></h2>
<p>On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
</p>
<ul><li> You have advantage on all Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

</li></ul>
<p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Primal_Path"> Primal Path </span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Indomitable_Might"> Indomitable Might </span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancestral_Protectors">Ancestral Protectors</span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, while you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of spiritual warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spirit_Shield">Spirit Shield</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, if you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consult_the_Spirits">Consult the Spirits</span></h3>

Rather than creating a spherical sensor, it invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
</p><p>After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vengeful_Ancestors">Vengeful Ancestors</span></h3>
<p>At 14th level, when you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Restriction:_Dwarves_Only">Restriction: Dwarves Only</span></h3>
<p>Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Battlerager_Armor">Battlerager Armor</span></h3>

</p><p>While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
</p><p>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reckless_Abandon">Reckless Abandon</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish when your rage ends.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intimidating_Presence">Intimidating Presence</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone. Choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
</p><p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Retaliation">Retaliation</span></h3>

</li><li><b>Tundra:</b> Each creature of your choice in your aura gains 2 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3 at 5th level, 4 at 10th level, 5 at 15th level, and 6 at 20th level.  
</li></ul>

<p>At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active.

</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shielding_Storm">Shielding Storm</span></h3>
<p>At 10th level, each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.

</li><li><b>Tundra:</b> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.
