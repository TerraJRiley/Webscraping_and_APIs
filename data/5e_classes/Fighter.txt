<p><sup>(Xanathar's Guide To Everything)</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Archer_Lore">Arcane Archer Lore</span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the <a href="/web/20190207025038/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Prestidigitation" title="Prestidigitation">Prestidigitation</a> or the <a href="/web/20190207025038/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Druidcraft" title="Druidcraft">Druidcraft</a> cantrip. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Shot">Arcane Shot</span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, when you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice. Once per turn, when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Magic_Arrow">Magic Arrow</span></h3>
<p>At 7th level, whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Curving_Shot">Curving Shot</span></h3>
<p>At 7th level, when you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ever-Ready_Shot">Ever-Ready Shot</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, if you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Shot_Options">Arcane Shot Options</span></h3>
<p>The options are all magical effects. If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Banishing Arrow:</b> The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target's speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.
</li><li><b>Beguiling Arrow:</b> The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Bursting Arrow:</b> Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each. The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Enfeebling Arrow:</b> The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn. The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Grasping Arrow:</b> The creature hit by the arrow is wreathed in brambles and takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again. The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Piercing Arrow:</b> When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Seeking Arrow:</b> When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location. The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.
</li><li><b>Shadow Arrow:</b> The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

</li><li><b>Evasive Footwork:</b> When you move on your turn, you can expend a superiority die, adding the total to your AC until you stop moving.  
</li><li><b>Feinting Attack:</b> You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target.

</li><li><b>Goading Attack:</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you.

</li><li><b>Menacing Attack:</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target.

</li><li><b>Rally:</b> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.  
</li><li><b>Riposte:</b> When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.  
</li><li><b>Sweeping Attack:</b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.  
</li><li><b>Trip Attack:</b> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
