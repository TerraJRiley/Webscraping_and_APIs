I don't care about him being gay. Love the man to death and just need help on how to handle this. He says he wants to finally explore and be more open. 

Do I just take him to a gay bar, knock back a few beers and play wingman? Is there more to men's relationships?

Vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9 [HPV],"Please vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9 as soon as possible:

&gt; Human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence varies by population. This study investigated anal HPV type detection risk by country in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) at risk of HIV. Sexually active HIV-1-uninfected MSM and TW were enrolled at eight sites: four in the United States (US), two in Thailand, one in Peru, and one in South Africa. Baseline anal HPV swabs were collected, and DNA typing was performed. One hundred and ninety-five participants, 76 (42%) from the US, had a mean age of 30.9 years (range 18–64). In 182 participants with results available, anal HPV infection was common with 169 (93%) with ≥1 type, 132 (73%) with ≥1 nine-valent vaccine types, and 66 (36%) with HPV 16. **Participants in the US had a higher prevalence of HPV 16 (56%, p = 0.004) and HPV 6 (69%, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the other regions.** Stimulant drug use was significantly associated with HPV 6 detection. Anal HPV is highly prevalent in this population of MSM and TW sampled from four countries, with HPV 16 the most commonly detected type. The nine-valent HPV vaccine has the potential to provide significant protection if given prior to exposure.

http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956462418797864

Vaccinate yourself even if you had previous HPV infections:

&gt; Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinating previously infected individuals.

http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/04/1714712114

&gt; The introduction of anti-HPV vaccination during the follow-up post treatment for HPV-linked disease is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Super-security conscious BF has an unknown-to-me guy's name and DOB on a post-it note in our mutually-shared desk. WTF?,"While looking for a set of spare car keys today in a desk we mutally share in our home, I ran across a guy's name and DOB on a post-it note in my BF's handwriting. My BF is SUPER security-concious when it comes to internet/computer/personal info types of things. He even shreds birthday cards 3 days after his b-day.  He NEVER leaves anything with any personal information on it lying in an unlocked desk drawer.  

He was using the desk and the computer on it last night and this morning, and he left 2 hours ago for the weekend to help care for a dying relative 2 hours away--- and that part isn't a story--- I know that for a fact. I was in this same desk drawer yesterday and this post-it wasn't there then. Why does he have this and where did he get it? He didn't leave the house between last night and when he left to go to care for the relative.   I'm not normally suspicious but he never leaves anything with any personal info lying around.--- it seems really weird.

Visiting a friend after transition surgery...,"Hey guys! My friend from university is going to be visiting my city to get some sort of transition surgery. I didn't ask the specifics because they're none of my business, but I have tentative permission to come visit him while he is recovering. 

I'm still kind of getting used to thinking of him as male because we haven't talked that much since Uni and the last time we saw each other face to face was the day he told me he was trans, so I'm a little nervous I might do something offensive while he's literally recovering from surgery. My friend can also be kind of quiet and doesn't always let people know when they have hurt him/offended him, and thinks about others often above himself to the point that I don't always know if I have offended him and I don't want to do that. 

I think it's ok to bring flowers because I would do that for a guy recovering in hospital too, but maybe something more generally neutral like candy or food from my city would be better? 

Maybe I'm just thinking about this too much because I'm nervous I'll say the wrong thing or be awkward (a perpetual problem for me), but while generally it seems like his family has been supportive and our joint friend group is heavily LGBTQ and has been pretty unsurprised and supportive of his transition, I just want to know more about what you wish people around you had known in the middle/early days of your transition to make it easier for you. I mean, we're all human and we all make mistakes - I don't expect to be perfect, but I would feel a lot more comfortable if I was less ignorant (and learning about the cold facts of transitioning don't help much with understanding the emotional parts of transitioning). 

He's FTM btw if that was not obvious. 

Here's hoping he doesn't have a Reddit &lt;3

Thanks guys!",ainbow

HOW TO KNOW IF A MAN IS GAY?,"Hey y'all,


I want to know whether a man is gay or not but not based on stupid stereotypes and social stigma. 

I hire a technician for repairing stuff at the house from time to time. His ass is usually partially exposed but that may be because he is climbing a metal ladder. He touches his front junk for 5 secs or less couple of times over 2 hrs period of time to fix his junk positions.

His appearance:

Uneducated

Hot and attractive

Got a good ass no muscles leaned a bit skinny

Poor outfit becoz he is broke

He is living with his brother and roommates

He is young

Single

Simple and friendly

I donno maybe his actions come from his ignorance about manners. We live in a homophobe country. He may be straight and not knowing he is acting gay 


Thanks y'all.....

Why are people so determined to make transgender people feel invalidated?,"I’ve recently read several threads (especially in light of [the NY Times’ article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html)) claiming that having to use a transgender person’s preferred pronouns is “forcing” a “neoprogressive agenda” on society, and similar extremist comments. It makes me sad. And to those who believe this, I have something to say.


Nobody is forcing anything on you. What we’re *asking* you to do is simply to respect the wishes of others. You don’t even have to go out of your way to do it – just say “she” instead of “he” (or vice versa). I understand that it doesn’t mean much to you, but to a trans person it can mean the world. Nobody’s *making* you do it. But you should do it *anyway* – that’s the point! You should do it out of respect for others’ rights to live their lives however they choose. Making that small change – just saying “he” instead of “she” – doesn’t harm you or disadvantage you. You’re not giving up anything or losing anything. But by saying it, you’re letting the world know that you respect others enough to treat them like human beings. 


Trans people have their own likes, dislikes, hobbies, opinions and personalities, just like everyone else, so please treat them as such. They’re not just extras in the background of your life, and their feelings are no less valid. You might not consider misgendering someone to be hurtful, but no one needs your permission to be offended. Show the world that even if you take issue with the way trans people live their lives, you at least honour the choice they’ve made, because they have as much right to that choice as you. 


You don’t have to like it. But please try to respect it.",ainbow

I'm so sorry (a rant and an apology),"I'm sort of in a weird position to be giving an apology but it feels more than necessary and this has been weighing me down all day.

I live in the south, I was raised by *extremely* conservative Christian parents, yes the homophobic kind, and yes the kind that spread that homophobia onto their children. I wouldn't say I was a maliciously homophobic kid, it's just whenever I would see a gay couple in public, I remembered my parents telling me they were ""sinners"" and ""abominations to the Lord"" and would view them as such.

I'm 17 now, and pansexual. I've long since realized the views of my parents are utter bullshit. And also, for the first time in my life I'm dating a boy, have been for the past month. We met today at a Five Guys in my town, it was a normal date for the most part but I hadn't seen him in a couple days so I was pretty excited to see him. 

When I went to leave I gave him a hug in the parking lot and we kissed. It's the first time we've really shown that amount of affection in public (keep in mind i live in the south). I have pretty awful social anxiety to begin with, and that coupled with the fact that I was doing something still considered extremely taboo where I live already had me all nervous, and then I caught his eyes. It was an older man, maybe 60, walking out of the restaurant. There was no doubt he saw us kiss, and although he didn't say a word, I could tell exactly what he was thinking as he stared at me. 

I felt...vulnerable. Probably more vulnerable than I've ever felt. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that that man and his judgmental glare was a picture perfect representation of my parents, and of me, when i was young. I can't control what my parents do, and their actions are their own, but when I was younger, *I was the one giving gay couples those glares*. Even though I was just a kid, I was contributing to that awful awful feeling of vulnerability and unwelcomeness that just a simple look can convey to that gay couple cuddling in a movie theater, or a lesbian couple holding hands in a park, doing things that if it were a straight couple, no one would think twice about.

Even though now I'm a part of the community that I'm apologizing to, I still am so so sorry for that hateful person I was conditioned to be",ainbow

I am making a transgender film - need some help,"Hi folks!   My name is Alex and I’m a film student studying in Chapman University for my MFA in film production.  I am also a transgender  person.  It is  widely known that queer people, especially transgender  people, are  hugely underrepresented in film and television.  I have  studied the  performance arts since undergrad, and always struggled with  the feeling  of not knowing where my place is.

This  year I finally have a chance to direct a short film written by a queer  screenwriter about a transgender man who is a mechanic like his father  and works at the same car shop where his father works.  His father is  having a hard time with his transition and while struggling to get his  dad's acceptance, he also faces verbal abuse from his boss because of  who he is.  Finally, however, when he overhears his father sharing a scecret, he finds the strength to stand up for himself and   fight, while also bonding with his father deeply.

When  I got the script I told myself “no matter how hard it is, I  will cast a  transgender actor for the transgender role”.  And so I did,  and I am proud of it.  Even though I’m still a student filmmaker, I  think  someone somewhere needs to take representation seriously.  By making the  effort to put queer people on screen, I hope I will inspire others  to  follow.   Once this film is made my team will put our best  efforts   into having as  many people see it as possible, because I  believe the message we are  sending through the film is also crucial: be  who you are, don’t change  for others, fight for yourself.

Finally, I cannot post the fundraising link on this page, so if anyone is interested in helping, please contact me via private message.",ainbow

TERFs are making me have homophobic and mysoginistic thoughts. I hate it,"I hate to admit it, but after seeing TERF posts and tweets over and over I am beginning to have intrusive thoughts.
I know that TERFs are just a small minority of hateful people like incels or nazis, but their flawed ideas really get on my nerves.

For instance, being them for the most part butch lesbians, I am becoming afraid of being friend with butch lesbians because I would hate to accidentally befriend a TERF.

I've spent most of my teenage years fighting against patriarchy and against everything that is unfair towards women, but I did not fight that much to get some women to discriminate other women.

I'm starting to hate being feminist because of them and I don't want to end up hating being a woman because of the transphobia they portray ""for the benefit of women"".

I support women in every shape: cis, trans, intersex, black, white and every other kind of them out there, but I don't support TERFs and I thoroughly hate that they are making me less passionate or even fearful of being a feminist.

Please, I need some motivation to not lose hope and still be feminist despite TERFs transforming feminism in discrimination. I would really hate if someday someone would assume I'm a man-hater or a transphobic woman if that's what feminism is going to become.",ainbow

Help me explain gender self-identity to my kids,"My wife and I are both heterosexual.  We have two children, a boy and a girl, in middle and elementary school respectively.  I had a gay uncle I was always close to.  My wife's family ran a carnival her whole life, where all forms of queer were very accepted and embraced.  Neither of us have any biases I'm aware of.  We are aware of the bigotry that's out there, and we don't condone it.

Now...  our public school system is introducing ""gender self-identity"" into the ""health"" curriculum and my kids don't understand it.  The teachers clearly don't understand it.  And I don't understand it.  I spend a fair amount of time helping my kids understand things they're taught in school, things they see on YouTube, etc.

The question I see them wrestling with is ""if you're telling me male and female isn't about what's in my pants, then how do I know what 'male', 'female, and 'something else' means?  How do I pick?""

I find this maybe more complicated because my son in particular has periodically said things like ""I feel like I'm not like other kids"" since he started pre-school.  I started telling him from a young age that everyone feels that way.  He understands insecurity, shyness, feeling ""inadequate"" when it comes to sports.  He usually ends up feeling like this because kids were playing a sport or tag or something on the playground and he's just objectively not good.  It's a bit of a negative spiral, because the fact that he's not good makes him not want to play or practice anything athletic, so he just falls further behind the ""curve"" if you will.  He knows that, and has ""adapted"" by just laughing at himself when appropriate and not appearing (outwardly) insecure about it.  He's the kind of kid that will raise his hand in gym class and say ""pick me last, because I'm just horrible"" and everyone will laugh.

I'll leave the psychological background there.  By any objective assessment he's a happy, smart, well adjusted, and popular kid.  He has crushes on girls from time to time (or at least says he does).

So...  his (and her and my) question is ""if gender self-identity doesn't mean my sex organs, what does it mean?  If you ask me my eye-color self identity I don't know what that means other than what I see in the mirror.  If you tell me to forget about my actual eye color and ask me what I feel like, I don't know how to answer.  I don't know any other definition.""

So I do my best to explain it as I understand it, and I've actually done some searching on Google, but I can't find any explanation that goes much beyond ""some people feel like they received the wrong organs at birth"" or something like that.

Is that what it is?  I honestly don't get it.  I go through a thought exercise of saying ""instead of calling it gender self-identity, let's call it something else.  If we called it 'astrological self identity' and said that it's not necessarily linked to your sex, how would I know my 'astrological self identity' without a list of what the options are and what they mean?""  Or like asking somebody if they're an introvert or extrovert without explaining what those things mean.

I don't want this to come across as insensitive or disrespectful.  It's just foreign to me.  I'd have no problem calling myself gender non-binary, but I don't know what it means.  I just have no internal concept of my gender self-identity.  I have no basis to say male or female or otherwise, so when they're asking me what all this means I'm honestly just not sure.

I admit that this all feels strangely reminiscent of the ""born again"" type Christian camps I spent a few summers at as a kid.  There was all this ""accept the light of Christ into your heart"" stuff, and all these people crying and saying they felt the light of God enter their heart and all that.  I wanted to feel it, but I never did.  I decided it was all probably a psychological phenomenon.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  Good for them, I'm glad they find happiness in that.  My parents did.  Or at least my Dad did, I suspect my Mom was just playing along, but her life kind of revolves around the church.  Fortunately nobody really persecutes Christians in the US (although certainly many intellectuals would look down on my parents' faith).

That's a lot of ramble, but I think there's a sane question in there.",ainbow

It Gets Bitter: What Being Enby Means to Me (CW: Suicide),"From a suicide note I wrote back in 2011:

""Apart from the essentially horrible nature of capitalist industrial civilization, an overwhelming sense of shame motivates me to leave. I'm forced to interact with people to survive, but nobody treats me with respect or affection - much less both. If not for shame and the yearning for better things, I could be happy with simple pleasures. I'm 28 and have only ever been kissed by one person. There's no way to undo that level of social scorn. I don't care that much myself - just seems like a waste - but the cultural dynamics make it impossible to endure. I can't ever achieve respect with that hanging over my head. I'm neither man nor woman, and thus no one can even theoretically be attracted to me. Maybe if I were prettier, but the record can only be described as fail. You can't overestimate the importance of existing outside the gender binary. I'm literally not even a person.""

A few more folks have kissed me since then, but fundamentally nothing has changed in my daily experience.

Positivity posts &amp; bubbly optimism do enbies like me a grave disservice. For us, it never gets better. Be careful out there!",ainbow

I am a messy person,"so I posted this to r/gay as I thought there weren't these subs around... Which is pretty lame of me to not think outside the box but here we are ! 

About 2 years ago I came to finally understand that these feelings I have a had about girls is pretty okay and natural... or any sexual feeling I had was ok or natural really. (family is conservative, heart in the right place but traditional as hell.) So I know I find girls sexually attractive... Yet I find myself emotionally attracted to boys? 

I know this is stemming from a black-and-white way of thinking but I honestly don't know why. I have had an emotionally exhausting 2 years being in love with my gay male 'best' friend. He had a weird feeling torwards me as well, or so he says, but I am not coming to realize and understand was just a toxic relationship between a narcissist and someone with low self-esteem and who didn't love herself enough to realize the treatment she was getting was not okay. It has skewed my way of thinking and mentally fucked me up and I am still recovering. 

I'm starting to gain my own sense of independence now and finding myself once again,   but I still find myself as an enigma to people around me as I don't know exactly what it is i want. 
I like femme girls, yet i can't seem to make friends with them. 
I see myself being attracted to certain men, but I don't want to blow them. 
I love the idea of being fucked by men and women, yet when it comes down to doing it I lose interest completely.... 
It's only sometimes I am turned on and that has been with my gay male best friend! I DON'T KNOW WHAT OR WHO I AM!!! I know I can only give myself an answer but I just need a little help in finding my own clarity... or know if I'm not the only one who feels this way like ???? 
Thank you.",ainbow

Outing a student at home,"Okay so one of my students came out at school as a trans guy. I was so excited and proud of him. He wanted me to his pronouns and new name in class, he told his soccer team, it was exciting. 

He isnt ready to come out at home.

The principal out of concern that a teacher or another student would out him inadvertently, gave him an ultimatum. Come out tonight (yes tonight) or they will call home and out them. 

What. The. Fuck. 

Not only is that the most irresponsible thing I've ever heard. It's illegal. 

I later found out that she wasnt actually planning on calling home. That she was trying to ""push"" him to come out. Maybe I can sort of respect her intention to avoid someone inadvertently outing him, but how is it better to intentionally out him?! When I have a student coming to me crying because the principal said they'd out them, it doesnt matter if you had good intentions, it doesnt matter if you weren't really going to do it. What you did was wrong, irresponsible, and frankly traumatizing.

Coming Out Day 2018: We Ain't There Yet,"🏳️‍🌈Happy Coming Out Day! Remember that so many of us QTies (queer &amp; trans folks) ain't successful, beautiful, lovable, happy, included, accepted, etc. under the current cistem. Parties &amp; positivity don't change that. Only revolution will.🏳️‍🌈

While suspicious of categorization, I presently identify as all of the following, depending on operating definition: queer, nonbinary, genderqueer, trans, pan, bi. I feel like at least an honorary faggot because of how often haters call me that.

My enby identity doesn't matter, because nobody genuinely gets it.

My sexuality doesn't matter, because folks desire men &amp;/or women, not freakish ambiguous &amp; unintelligible things.

💔Being queer &amp; coming out ain't no sanguine story for me. I'm grateful for all I've learned &amp; the connections with fabulous folks I've made, but I refuse to pretend I'm okay for anyone's comfort or convenience.💔

Cisheteropatriarchy remains a global emergency.

💥Destroy what destroys you!💥

Queerness means death to all domination everywhere.

"[thought] If gene editing becomes widespread in the future, it may be possible to attempt to eliminate LGBT/non-heterosexual people (to the point that heterosexuality will be the only allowed sexual orientation).","Fundamentally religious people, as well as governments that actively oppress LGBT people may become gleeful in that now they can attempt to get rid of whom they view as socially deviant. Some of these groups still think that homosexuality/bisexuality/whatever is not heterosexual is a choice, or that they threaten what they think goes into traditional gender roles, and that it should be eliminated as much as possible. Gene editing may only make it easier for them to reach this goal. This might not be too much of a problem in countries where LGBT people are protected by law, unless far-right groups take control of the governments of such countries. I wish we wouldn't have to worry about these kind of people, but some just like to have power and control over what they think are undesirable minorities.",ainbow

My Day With Homophobia [Rant],"I [17/M] Am wore out mentally and physically. My Alarm went off at 4:35 A.M. I showered, dressed, and ate breakfast. Fixed my truck (Bad starter) checked the neighbor's cattle (I live next to a ranch) I then got dressed and went to the country church roughly 10 miles from my house. It's a small fundamental Missionary Baptist church, it's a very toxic and homophobic environment. I am forced to go because the pastor is my older brother [26/M]. This is small town Tennessee, everyone knows everyone and the church runs the local government, everything and everyone bleeds homophobia. I am the choir leader at the church one of the few positive perks of my brother being the pastor and the only thing I enjoy about church. My brother, as usual, touched on the hippies, gays, feminists, and Democrats. 'These people are the unclean and the unrighteous. They are baby killers, ------ lovers, sand ------'-, Trump haters, and satan worshipers.' My mother sat next to me gobbling up his bullshit. He talks of the Christian love we have after salvation but he spews nothing but hatred out of his mouth. I am gay, my friends and liberal cousins know but my immediate family doesn't. For a long time, I hated myself because my religion told me to. I do what a good southern boy does, go mudding, hunt, go to church, get a girlfriend, go to trade school, and say please and thank you and ma'am/sir. But after all this, I still love purple, baking, quilting, cat vids, and Toyotas (lol). I hooked up with a guy once I loved the sex but I feel great regret and dirty for it.
1: my first time was not with someone special;
2: I have much self-hatred and internalized homophobia.

All of this hatred against gays in my religion has cost me my belief in religion. I became an atheist but then I looked up to the night sky and seen a big beautiful universe, I have to believe in a god. I'm now deist with Chastain morals. 
I'm still at home, my parents are moderate Republicans, they're not trump fans but will much rather have him than anyone else (Hillary). They would never disown me, but my brother? Yes, he would. I want to come out and I should for my mental and social health. This crushing weight of guilt has caused me to become socially awkward, I have two real friends and I can't form relationships of any kind. 
But for my physical safety I keep my secret and this ver process continues over and over again.

awkward attraction to trans people,"So I'm attracted to all kinds of different people and normally that's just fine.  The problem is I also really like more gender queer looking people.  That's just fine for people who are that but sometimes that's a little awkward. I was at some kink party this past weekend and that means I run into way more non cis people than normal.  I ended up doing a bunch of stuff  with someone who looked extreamly androgens and that was defently a plus for me.  I later find out they're very much ftm. I can't be the only one who runs into this. I didn't do anything to make them feel weird but for me it feels really weird liking somthing about someone that they probably hate.  

This obviously isn't everyone.  I've met a trans women that is way more happy with their penis than me as a cis guy have ever been with mine. Just the awkward feelings are defently there whenever I'm doing kink(or wherever) things at some party with a trans person.

Anyone Interested In Hearing Some Lo-Fi Music From An Indie Artist Who Also Happens To Be A Member Of The LGBTQ Community?,"I go by Huddie Elite, my real name's Tyler, but I'm a singer/songwriter/producer who works out of his bedroom creating music and posting it to YouTube. My voice isn't the greatest, but I've been writing since I was 11 and laying down beats since I was 16. I also just so happen to be bisexual, an issue I've dealt with trying to decide whether to hide away or use to my advantage. Being a member of a minority group, especially the LGBT community which tend to be very loyal to its entertainers, can help me to better develop a following but at the same time, I don't want that to be my defining feature as an artist and would rather attract attention for my writing and my beats rather than my sexuality. It's a difficult line to straddle but I'm trying. I know I feel like I can relate to the music a bit more when it's coming from the mind of a LGBT member and I'd like to share some of my work with some of you on here to see if you all might possibly feel something from what I write.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcEqpgB09L8vyOjfHlSj\_g?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcEqpgB09L8vyOjfHlSj_g?view_as=subscriber)

My music is mostly dark alternative electropop. You can check out my youtube channel if you'd like, give me some constructive criticism, sub to me if you're feeling it or just ignore me all together if not. Just though maybe other LGBT members might find themselves more into the music and, in particular, the lyrics. I have one electronic cover version of the old country classic ""The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia"" while all of the other tracks are complete originals.

"Please calm me down, I’m so scared.","I don’t know where else to put this, but I just need to say it. I’m scared. I’m scared as hell for whatever is coming up. I turned 18 in April, and it hurts seeing this country just slowly turning into this authoritarian dystopia. It hurts being a Democrat from a hard red state, going to college in a hard red state, because my vote is going to be one of the few that won’t matter at all comparatively. I’m a member of the LGBTQ+ community, and I’m scared of the fact that I came out to an entire crowd at my school, at least 300 people. I’m scared for my rights and my life, and I’m scared for my family. My mother, who’s in her 60’s, is going to have essential and important women’s rights stripped away. My handicapped father who’s ill a lot, is going to have trouble finding the health care he needs and being treated equally amongst those of us who aren’t. I just feel like I’m living in an Orwellian novel now, and that all of my worst nightmares are coming true. I really hope someone steps up and saves this country before it isn’t salvageable. ",ainbow

I found out a co-worker of mine is transitioning. I'm not sure what the appropriate or proper way is to act toward them when they come back?,"I was going to post this somewhere else but was afraid I'd get banned for doing so.  I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying what I'm going to say here so I'm on a throwaway account.  Hopefully I'll get some good advice here too.

&amp;#x200B;

I found the other day that a co-worker of mine is transitioning male to female.  I'll be honest, I'm a pretty conservative straight guy.  I don't understand the ""woman in a man's body"" thing.  It makes no sense to me at all.  I understand that makes me an asshole.  It's been explained to me more than once and I still don't understand it.  The entire thing makes me extremely uncomfortable which I know makes me even more of an asshole.  I expect this will likely make me extremely uncomfortable around my co-worker.  I'm definitely not going to be going around telling this person that they're wrong or telling others that I think they're wrong and I plan to keep my feelings about the situation to myself while at work even if people ask me.  It's not really my place to pass judgement on someone's personal decisions in the workplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I've been told is that they will be gone for a couple of months and when they return to work they'll be female.  I have no idea what their new name will be and obviously I'll be addressing them by whatever that is and using female pronouns as well.  Beyond that, I'm not sure if there is a proper protocol on how to respond to this.  Several of my co-workers so far have been going out of their way to be accepting and trying way too hard.  People who never said a word to this person before spent Friday going up to them and telling them how excited they were for them to make this change.  I'm not that person and I never will be.  The entire thing kind of freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable in so many different ways.  I fully understand that makes me a raging asshole.  That being said I'm not sure what the best way is to make my co-worker feel ""normal"" when they get back.  I'm sure the transition is not easy on them.  Can anyone give me some tips?

Since long I've went out with two girls in the hetero scene again, and walking them to their cab we've had verbal harassers to which I defended them. Continuing from there I walked home, but two on-looking cab drivers kept yelling at me ""gayy"" and taunting me to come up. I did, but the cowards didn't dare to put up a fight. 

I wish so much they did. I've taken on more people before. I so wish to demolish their jaw under my foot if only they weren't such wussies and actually dared to fight me. I stepped into that guys cab in the drivers seat to just take it, no fucking problem.

On the way home there was another guy yelling at me. I just put up my middle finger without looking back. 

I've tried krav maga self defence classes, but I couldn't keep it up due to my permanent elbow injury.

My story,"Hey guys. I just want to tell you what my life is like. I am gay in a homophobic country and it really sucks. I am 23. I came out to my parents and friends which resulted in me losing almost all of my friends. My mom and dad dicorced since he refused to support my ""disgusting"" life. He and my brother don't want to see me ever again. I am very depressed and envious. I am really mad because I have missed on every aspect of being a teenager- I never dated, never had a relationship, never hit on someone at a party, nothing. And now I am 23 and still haven't done any of these things while my peers some of them are getting married and having kids. It's so unfair. I want to have a family and kids but under the laws here that is absolutely impossible. There are no ways of meeting other gay people, there are no gay bars, clubs, people on apps look for random hookups only( tried that 3 times and they were the worst experiences in my life) and I am stuck. I can't move away from here too. This is my pathetic life. Almost no family and friends and absolutely no way of ever finding love. And I am just insanely envious of guys that live in the West and USA, Canada and so on. It's not fair! Some people get to be in accepting countries where they can find love and support even if their families reject them and here I am in this shithole with no way of doing anything.

Hardcore online stalker for years!,"Hello all! I hope you all are having a wonderful day! I just needed some advice on an issure that's been going on for quite some time.

Around two years ago I broke up with my ex. We were good for each other at first but things got really toxic after a while. Nothing physically bad it just got emotionally toxic and we were no longer a good match. This lasted two years. Okay so since the break up we tried being friends, etc. and it didn't work so I cut off contact completely.

After contact was at zero I started going on dating sites (more for hookups and friends not to actually date). Over time I started noticing patterns of profiles contacting me but never actually wanting to meet. This happened MANY times and that was just the beginning. Oddly also many of the profiles would get ""better"" and learn things I liked/disliked. For instance I would talk about something to one person, then a new profile would show up and it would have something positive I talked about in it's description.

Despite these profiles I would still manage to find real people in between so I thought whatever. At the same time my ex had been contacting me by any means necessary. After a certain point I just gave up blocking him because he would always create a new number and it got exhausting. To this day I still receive messages wanting to talk and get back together but I ignore them.

SO, at one point I got really frustrated about a year ago and I spoke to him. During this conversation he did admit to making a fake profile but not to several of them. I got really annoyed and never spoke to him again after that one time.

Alright so long story short I have many reasons to believe these numerous fake profiles are him. And when I say numerous I mean it, like he's make maybe 50-100 profiles (possibly more) all with unique pictures etc. They all are weirdly geared towards my interests and they all stop talking to me when I ask to meet in person. They all ask me similar questions, are all around my age, within a very specific distance from me, etc. etc.

Now this isn't the worst thing to happen but what do you think I should do? There's nothing I really CAN do right? It's honestly just annoying and I think he's doing it to annoy me. I suppose I just needed to vent. Anyone been in a situation like this before?",ainbow
Sex=/=Gender?,"I’m confused as to how gender is different than sex and why. As far as I’ve been told, gender is the role assigned to a person by society based on their sex and sex is what their biology says. A few issues with this though. If gender is determined by society, then you don’t decide your gender based on what’s comfortable to you because society chooses it for you. But society chooses it for you based on your sex so that leads back to gender being sex. Because gender is what society gives you, but society gives it to you based on and equivalent to your sex",ainbow

Life is short,"My husband passed away on August 13. We were married for 6 years, knew each other much longer.

I remember the weekend before we were married he told me he had a terminal illness and cried because he knew one day he couldn't be there and gave me a chance to get out of the marriage. I told him nothing would stop me, and sang him a verse from a song in our bed in Brooklyn before we fell asleep. Four months ago he called me while I was at work and was hysterical and upset, talking about how he was dying soon and he could feel it happening. He said he wanted me to find someone else, better than him, and to be happy. I calmed him down and largely forgot about it.

By this point we had spent years going to every doctor, every specialist, trying every medication, traveling to and from L.A., NYC, SF, and everywhere in between to help him with his chronic pain, and daily struggle. The ordeal of him being sick, not feeling well, etc. was a daily occurrence, changing hour by hour. Some days were better than others. It had become so routine that I hardly noticed how incredibly sick he had gotten.

After July 4th he was having trouble walking, standing, and by August 1st he was completely confined to our bed. I barely slept over the next week to take care of him. The last words he said to me were ""I'm ready to go now."" and being as naive as I always was with him I assumed this meant he was ready to go to the hospital. Looking back I don't think that's what he meant at all. I got him to our car in the driveway but he was completely unresponsive so I called 911 they rushed him to the ER. The next time I saw him roughly 4 hours later a machine was breathing for him, he was covered in warming blankets. Over the next 24 hours he was connected to over a dozen machines and I was signing paperwork for an exploratory surgery.

After the surgery is when I really started to accept that he wasn't coming back. Within the next 24 hours I was signing paperwork to remove him from life support. I sat with him alone in that room and sang that same verse of that song to him. I felt his last heartbeat and heard his last breath and then my entire world ended.

It's been almost 2 months, I'm in therapy, I've not been able to return to work though I've tried a few times. His birthday is December 23. Our anniversary is January 29. I'm not able to get out of bed most days. I don't know what I'm going to do.

I really miss my husband.

If you have a partner in one respect or another, go tell them how much they mean to you.

I had been drinking and in retrospect i shouldnt have been deepthroating from the start of it because now he thought he could push my head down that far . I wish it was one of those funny moments that was laughed about but it wasnt he was pissed , he was just disgusted and walked away .. i felt like such an idiot . On my way walking home i messaged him and said im sorry and that i feel like shit ..and he said "" good "" "" you are disgusting you threw up all over my dick and i puked twice on the way home"" .

New YouTube Project - Queer &amp; Disabled,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting a new collaborative YouTube project called ""Queer and Disabled.""  My goal for this project is to bring visibility and lift up the queer community discussing gender (non cis) and disability. Before you think, ""I'm not disabled,"" I ask that you read on and then decide, especially since we are looking for more volunteers from all over the globe and all walks of life. The project is geared anyone 18+ who sits outside the cis gender box, like transgender men &amp; transgender women, intersex, gender fluid, gender queer, androgyne, bigender, agender and non binary (not a complete list, brain fog is real, lol)...you get the idea (except otherkin),  who also deal with mental, learning, hearing, visual, intellectual, &amp;/or physical disabilities or chronic illnesses, whether visible or invisible.

Below is our video introducing the project (it's our first so please be kind, it takes a little time to get used to speaking to YouTubers lol). Note: I understand many don't consider themselves ""disabled enough"" to be considered ""disabled"" but that's part of the project as well. Trying to throw off the stigma behind various disabilities to show even if we do deal with different issues when it comes to our gender identity, both visible and invisible disabilities are valid.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions or you are interested in participating, please email the project at [daqueer@outlook.com](mailto:daqueer@outlook.com)

"Work place issue, not sure if I can get a lawyer involved (OH)","I've been working here for a few years and my boss/company owner has expressed many times a lot of very strong political views. Normally I've let it go or tried to take it as an opportunity to learn why the other side feels the way they do but recently sexuality has come up a bunch. My boss is VERY catholic and a few times in the past he has made derogatory comments about customers who he interpreted as gay (every time after they are gone), but it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Well today he was asking me a lot of questions about my past relationships ( I don't really  talk about personal things at work) and I told him I didn't really date to get out of the conversation and he started loudly playing a podcast about ""the evils of being gay"". I've had to listen to a lot unpopular opinions working here but I think this is my last straw. The thing is, is I'm working in my field and it took awhile to get here and I feel like this workplace discrimination and I started looking for [resources](https://dgmslaw.com/types-of-discrimination-in-the-workplace/) at the law firm closest to me and it doesn't really seem like I have a case and I'm afraid to tank a lot of money into this.

How to approach someone when you dont know their sexual orientation?,"I'm a pretty introverted guy as it is. But even when I find an opportunity to approach someone to ask them out, I convince myself that they're probably just straight and it's not worth the headache.

Why does it seem like so many straight people are so offended at the mere thought of being gay? Do they not realize how offensive that is to us?

So anyway, theres this guy at work that I'm really into. Hes not even my type, but I cant stop thinking about him. We make small talk here and there, but I cant figure out how to ask him out without potentially offending another straight guy.

Thinking of coming out to my family …,"Hey everyone.

So, I’m planning on coming out to my family by the end of this year. I’m an AMAB non-binary transperson (specifically, I consider myself more agender than anything else), and my family are all Christian, not particularly conservative, but not particularly liberal either. I’d also consider myself a Christian of some kind, though quite progressive politically and theologically (as my username indicates), and this has already caused some tension with my folks. It’s going to be really, really hard and difficult, and probably take a long time; but it’s going to be worth it. I just can’t keep living dishonestly with the people who mean the most to me in my life.

I’m interested if anyone knows of any good videos or short articles or things along those lines that I could use to talk to them or show them, or to help me find the language to talk to them, or support for people coming out to their families that I could look at/read/listen to.

Also, I’d appreciate whatever prayers or good vibes or positive thoughts you want to send my way.",ainbow

Advice,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to start a discussion/ask for some advice. Bear with me here, and if this is the wrong place to turn, please let me know respectfully.

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up pretty straight and in a catholic environment, but have always been open to the gay community and, through my not too recently outed brother, made a bunch of friends in the culture. I’ve always felt really at home with his group of friends, but that’s nothing out of the usual here, just good people being good people. Very recently, though, I found myself starting to wonder/fantasize about my own sexuality. I am a little ashamed to admit that porn has been the doorway in which I realized my lack of certainty in what I like. I have never been with a man before, but I have been thinking about it a lot now, to the point where I think I want to have a talk with my brother about advice. But first, I have two questions to follow this up with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this just a fetishization? I know porn is unhealthy, it’s literally been proven so, but can this be a result of a porn addiction and a bad way to think about it, rather than questions about my sexuality?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Has anyone else realized their own self-questionings from porn? Or was it something you’ve always kind of felt?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your responses. I don’t want to offend anyone if this is a fetishization. I am definitely confused, which I think merits a good, long think about this. I just don’t really know who to talk to/where to turn. My brother is a great person, but I don't know if I have enough sorted out in my head to talk to him, and having a discussion about porn with family is always a weird thing.",ainbow

"Funeral Parade of Roses, an essential Japanese gay and trans film, is free to watch on Kanopy now.","This is one of my absolutely favorite movies, if not THE favorite (though I don't usually tier my tastes). It's such an important film in my mind. I saw it first as a teenager and it might be one of my ""roots,"" as they say. I've revisited it many times since and was lucky enough to see it in theatres last year when they were screening it's new high definition remaster. It feels incredibly fresh even when it's absolutely a product of it's time, 1969. A rundown I appreciated on Film Comment:

""Without giving too much away, Funeral Parade of Roses is partly a loose modern queer rewrite of the Oedipus myth, although how and why it is doesn’t fully become clear until the end—when we witness the supremely paradoxical use of a subjective shot depicting the point of view, as it were, of an Oedipus figure who has just gouged out both his eyes. For the most part, however, Funeral Parade comes across as a free-form evocation of an unofficial coalition between two outsider communities in Tokyo: on one side, cross-dressers and other young gay men (the Japanese term being geiboi), and on the other, avant-garde artists.""

If you are interested in lgbtqi cinema at all, and even if you're not, watch it for your sake.

This post was deleted by r/lgbt twice.,"I am a gay conservative.

I am tired of being generalized as a liberal (and other things) because of something as small as my sexual orientation. That is literally the tiniest detail of my life.

I think LGBT culture is a good thing (Pride parades, drag, craziness). It is something that our previous generations needed to get by and something to escape to when society said ""you are not one of us"". If I was openly gay even ten years ago, life would be a lot more difficult. Life is still difficult for some of the LGBT community, especially the transgender community. We have made a lot of progress though. It is 2018 and as a gay man, I do not feel oppressed in society, and that is a privilege I appreciate to have in America while other countries behead people like me. What I dislike are political groups taking the LGBT community and using us as a platform to spread fear and ideologies assuming that we cannot think for ourselves.

The things I want in life are simple. I want my Fiance and I to have a nice comfortable life, I want children one day, I want a house and maybe even open up a successful business. I won't go into specific details about my political opinions, but point being: I think for myself.

I already expect to get backlash from this reddit page based off of a lot of posts I've seen here (hopefully I'm wrong), but I really think what I'm saying is important. Do I think other people need to have the same political and moral opinions as myself? Certainly not, but people need to think for themselves.

Society tells us that we HAVE to support everything that is 'left'. I am gay so I need to be a democrat. We are an easy target. They use our insecurities and vulnerabilities to tell us that we need them. We don't need them. We are better and stronger than that.

Before you decide to have an opinion on something, do ample research. Don't stick to regular news sources or Facebook. When I say this, I'm not assuming that you as the reader is not intelligent enough to do so, but for a while I was trapped into certain ways of thinking when I was in high school and in college. I always knew the left was ""for gay marriage"" so I always leaned towards that side, so naturally I adopted every other liberal policy as my own.

It wasn't until I started researching specific issues myself (this was about a year ago) that I started putting together my own political opinions and I have to say I can breath a little easier knowing about specific issues and having my own opinion that CNN didn't give me (even if I happen to agree with what they say).

I think nowadays, a lot of liberals are bigots. Yes, I used that word, usually used for right wing conservatives. It is defined as ""a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions"". and that is something that is very true. Whenever I express a opinion that isn't liberal (usually backed by statistics and data) its like my gay card is removed and I'm just some pile of horse sh\*t. Most media is liberal, and it is the more widely accepted political side.

To sum this up: I am not a product, I am not a poster child for any political party or organization, I am a normal person and my sexual orientation does not define who I am as a person.

In case anyone is interested, Brandon Straka, a member of the LGBT community, is the spokesperson for the #WalkAway movement. It is constantly growing and its really awesome to see others who feel the same way as I do. Here is the original video he posted: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk)",ainbow

I finally met a guy who's my type!!!,"I'm excited because I finally found a guy who's my type the guys I like are always masculine jock/frat type guys and as much as I hate to say it there are very little gay men like this. Every other gay man that I know is feminine in some way wether it be mannerisms, or interests. So last year the other out gay from my highschool (I'm going into college now) tried to ask me out and he wasn't feminine in terms of his mannerisms so I was thinking of giving him a chance but his interests were very feminine when we were talking and he told me his favorite things are drag race and real housewives also he ""religiously"" listened to madonna, cher, spears, and lana del ray and asked me if i did too. I politely told him no and I continued on with our conversation. I was turned off and told him that I just wanted to be friends. Later my date tried to set me up with his ex boyfriend who was very similar to him in the sense that they didn't have feminine mannerism per se but he wore makeup to cover up his blemishes and he ocassionaly wears high heels , female jeans, and female shirts sometimes so I wasn't interested at all

That gets me to college so last month me and the gay kid I went on a date with had freshman orientation (we're going to the same school), we both didn't really speak to eachother and I met this incoming football player he was known around his highschool for being a player ( apparently he banged a girl who was sitting next to us when we were making our schedules). So him and I were talking and he was telling me how hot some girl was, and then he asked me which girl I thought was hot so I told him I was gay. He then told me that he is bisexual and we had a conversation for an hour about practically everything sports, sneakers, food, movies, comic books etc etc. At the end he gave me his number and told me to make sure to see him on the first day of college and we kissed.",ainbow

My First Lesbian Kiss - A Proud Lesbain," 

***One of my best lesbian moment happened with me during my Graduation day.***

***i loved her so so much and we knew that our life is not going to be the same again, we won't be able to spend as much time together as we used to. She also loved me with all her soul but we have never committed to each other about our feelings.***

***Then something magical happened on my Graduation day, she took me to the washroom with her and told me about her feelings for me and i was like , i have the same feelings for you but never had enough courage to talk to you about it.***

***We had a pause, looked in each other's eyes and i can't tell how lovely she was looking then and we forgot everything and started kissing each other. We were so lovingly kissing each other that i wanted more and more of it. We kissed for some moment and then hugged each other and promised that whatever the world may think, we are never going to separate and stop loving each other.***

***And today after two years we are still together and i'm proud of my partner that she showed the courage i coudn't and we are so so happy.***

***Whenever i think of this moment, it feels like it happened just yesterday only....That's how young and fresh our love is.***

***To all those lesbians reading this post i would say only one thing.... Don't run away from her, don't leave her alone,overcome the fear of what the world will think of you and just go and commit your love and i'm sure you all will have a happy life after.***

"On gender, and why I don't get it","So, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

To get these things out of the way:
I'm not a conservative LGBT hater nor do I have any kind of grudge against people that prefer not to identify as male or female, but there are certain things I do not understand and would like to have the input of actual people on.

This is about people that are *biologically* male or female, I know that there are people who are *biologically* not one of those but this is not about them. This is a text about people that are *biologically* male or female but *identify* as something else, without drastically changing anything about them physically.

Don't we all believe that gender roles are stupid? That the concept of having to act a certain way because of how you were born is stupid?
Why is your gender important at all then? If gender roles shouldn't exist then why are you still trying to get away from them? Isn't this system of everyone being a *different* gender just perpetuating the believe that certain genders have connotations to them e.g. males being manly, females being girly.
Shouldn't gender be just another biological factor like the color of your eyes?
Is there something else to it? Am I missing the bigger picture? I would love to have some input on this.

If any of this sounded offensive, I am sorry and I can assure you that no matter what you identify as or if you agree or disagree with me, I am just trying to get a second opinion on this topic and have no grudge against anyone.",ainbow
My boyfriend just came out as trans to his mum. Again. It didn't go well," I'm sorry if this is written terribly this is happening now and I'm not great at writing and I'm panicking a little (a lot). This might be reeeeallly long.

Okay so backstory: My boyfriend (FtM 17) has been out for around 2 years everywhere except at home. His mother is a alcoholic - the type that drinks until she passes out for a period ranging from 2-14 days, then is functioning the rest of the time (this is maybe once every 2 months these days) - and is a self-absorbed, victim playing, narcissistic twat. She had no problem smoking and drinking throughout his entire childhood - and he had to take care of himself from a super young age. My boyfriend came out as trans to her a while back but he was flat out ignored - she got drunk and insisted it was a phase. She's very hostile when approached with anything that doesn't fit into her 'perfect world'; an example of this being when he told her his friends now called him by his new name, all she said was 'for fucks sake' then banned them from the house and got pissed for a week.

His dad is sometimes home, but he's been away in Germany for 2 months now, and is due to come back this Wednesday. English isn't his first language, and he seems to struggle to comprehend a lot of English words and he's also really traditional so telling him wasn't something my bf was looking forward to.

I do a lot for my boyfriend, and I don't say that to boost my own image. When I met him he was depressed, suicidal, alone and afraid of his family. I helped him make an appointment with a gender clinic, I helped him go to the doctors for antidepressants, I bought his deed poll for him to officially change his name, and I'm always by his side to correct anyone for misgendering him . My dad absolutely dotes on him, and introduces him as his son when we go somewhere new. He takes time off work to take him to his appointments, gets up in the middle of the night to pick him up from his parent's house; he just loves him like he is his own. When he enrolled for college and opened a new bank account, my dad and I agreed that he could put down our address as the one he is living at, so that any letters that were sent wouldn't end up at his parents house, which would out him. My boyfriend did this because he feared if his mother knew he was 'out', then she would throw him out; or something worse. My bf genuinely has nightmares of his mum trying to kill him.

So onto today's events; my bf went to college from his parents house, only to find the lecturer was off sick. He went to get the bus home, where he found he had forgotten his wallet, so he messaged his mum on facebook. Though he was asking for her to come pick him up, she thought he was asking her to look for his wallet, which resulted in her going through his drawers. This is when she found the deed poll. I don't have exact details of what happened next but I know she picked him up from college and proceeded to go absolutely nuts at him. She (obviously) played the victim card, and claimed that he was a liar, that she was going to get into trouble for him putting my house as his address, that he was going to have to tell his dad, or she would (which implies it would be a circle jerk of hating over their son, as they so often do). Once they got home, my bf messaged me in floods of tears, terrified of what his mum was going to do. I managed to console him and told him to go and have a proper talk with his mother, as I thought (foolishly) that perhaps she could be appealed to. I don't know why I thought this would work, since she's not shown an ounce of humanity yet, but I just wanted my boy to stop hurting.

Well, this didn't go well. He got back after an hour, worse than before. She told him, and I'm shaking while typing this, the following things:

\- He HAS to tell his dad that he is trans, or else she would in her own fashion. When my bf then told her he was scared his dad would hate him for it, she laughed and said he probably would, but he'd have to 'deal with it'

\-He was a 'terrible' boy- she claimed he made no effort to look like a boy (which really got my down with gendering clothes and everything feelings boilin), and was just a girl with a boys name.

\-He has to be more mature if he wants to transition (... he literally cooks for himself, is making a decent income with art, is looking to move out asap, etc, but she just sits on her sofa and smokes 3 packs a day and shits herself when she's too pished to be conscious???)

\-That if he tells his dad he's trans, it'll ruin his one week away from work (fucking cry me some cishet tears smh)

\-I'm now banned from going over because he 'disrespected her'

He's now in bits, crying and looking at running away. He wants to see his dad on Wednesday, then move all of his belongings to my house on Thursday, and leave a letter for his mum and dad. My boy doesn't deserve this, it breaks my heart. Thank you if you made it to here, I know this was super long but its such a complicated matter. I don't expect anything, I just needed somewhere to rant. Bless you all, I hope you have a beautiful day.",ainbow

"Empathetic, Single... And Ace","(originally posted to /r/lgbt but no help received)  
Hi,  I'm 28, ace, panromantic, agender, AFAB, and deeply empathetic. This is  going to sound strange maybe, but how do I determine whether I want to  date a person or whether I want to support them emotionally? Since  sexual attraction is not on my radar, I have always had a hard time determining this. Jokingly I refer to myself as an Emotional Support  Human, since I tend to be the kind of listening ear and supportive  shoulder that people seem to instinctively turn to, but that's made my  sense of friend vs datefriend very blurry. I have actually accidentally violated others' boundaries in the past while trying to Be A Good  Friend. I pack-bond like crazy and will do anything for people that I  have pack-bonded with.

Track record: I've  been in one relationship, with my best friend, that lasted nearly 13 years and was basically a romance novel of a relationship. Other than  that, a dance in high school and a single OKCupid date during a break in  the LTR.

There have been and are people  that I feel emotionally/socially attracted to, close friends, but I  don't know how to figure out whether I'm attracted in a datefriend sense  or simply feeling close-friend-pack-bond-empathy, and since I tend to  be the first person people in this category tell when they're in  relationship troubles, this muddies the water considerably.

(Also, asking me to consider whether I want to spend the rest of my life with them isn't helpful, because a: pack-bond like CRAZY, and b: I have ADD and time blindness kicks my ass. ""The rest of my life"" is neurologically something I have a hard time wrapping my brain around. Hell, I have a hard time wrapping my brain around ""in a few hours"".)",ainbow

Gay panic in action,"I'm a gay trans man. About a week ago some dude in another sub I go to was claiming that ""99%"" of the women he was trying to talk to were gay men trying to trick him. I argued with him about his claim but he held firm and got mad when I pointed out that anecdotes aren't facts and he was sounding homophobic. He posted a couple more times to the same response but I ignored it.

Then I log into Reddit this morning to a message. The same person replied again but with a link to another person's post. In this post the person was complaining about catfishing on the personals subs.

The fucking jerkoff conflated catfishing with gay men ""tricking"" him. Admittedly I've had a lot going on, so my reply consisted of calling them a homophobic dumbass, pointing out that the two are NOT the same and told them to leave me alone.

This strikes me as gay panic and that's scary. And it makes me angry. This person is so fucking homophobic and self centered that they assume something like this, that we're out to ""convert"" people or force ourselves on them... Ugh. What a way to start the day.",ainbow

I'm male and my boyfriend is transitioning from Female to Male. We live a little bit outside of Toronto (Not together). Talking with other transgender people who we know for advice as well. Have had the 519 recommended to us. His parents aren't supportive about it, but my family is doing everything they can and are completely supportive and encouraging of the transition.

Questions:

What advice would you give to someone about transitioning?

How did you find transitioning and what was it like for you?

Any other advice is absolutely welcome and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

Advice please: super homophobic mom is working to become a domestic abuse victim advocate,"Please direct me to a more suitable subreddit if this is the wrong place. 

My mom is a super conservative Bible thumping homophobe who thinks that anyone who is not cis-het literally suffers from mental illness. She has her associates degree and is working on becoming an advocate, possibly counselor, for children coming from domestic violence households. At first I was proud that she wanted to do such a good thing, she decided to pursue it after witnessing the amazing people who helped our family when I was sexually abused. 

And then I thought about it some more. Especially recently after going on her Facebook and seeing [this particular post and comment section.](https://imgur.com/a/vLcsD5Y) I realised that she might do more harm than good for the LGBT youth who will inevitably come through her door. 

Also, she would often mention how great her psych Prof was because when my mom flat out disagreed with her on things when it crossed her religious opinions, the professor did not penalize her. This worries me a lot because I already knew she is completely closed minded, and to have her professor validate that behavior when she will be working with emotionally vulnerable kids, it just makes me so uncomfortable.

Is there anyone I can contact to inform them and make it more difficult for her to get a job like this? Is that a horrible thing to want to do? I am very low contact with her and no contact with my dad because of the way I was treated growing up so I'm not about to pussyfoot around her feelings, and I'm genuinely more worried about the damage she could cause. If anyone knows of anything I can do, please let me know!

Edit: I would like to add, this is only one facet, although a VERY important one, to why she is unfit for this type of job. Other things she has done includes 

* A 14 year old girl in our church was raped by my friend's dad, who was in his 20s with children. To this day she blames the girl for ""seducing him"" which wasn't the case, and allowing him in our home with all 4 of her children present.

* blaming me and my siblings for my dad's insane temper, in which he emotionally and physically abused us horrifically, and joining in as well, backing is into a corner and screaming into our faces and hitting us with the closest object she could grab.

* when I tried to tell her I was suicidal as a teen, she brushed it off with a ""we love you and don't want you to die""... That was the end of it and I muddled through till I could move away and get real help.

There's so much more that I could write a novel but these are the red flags that pop into my mind immediately. Maybe this is the wrong place to ask after all, but since my mind was in the LGBT part, this is the first place I thought of. Again, redirect me to a more fitting sub if you know of one. Thank you.",ainbow

My question to you, is 'gay bar' the correct and a non offensive term to use, or should I be referencing it as something else?

But, y'know, what the fuck do I know? I come out of my shell for the first time the night a friend's band plays, expressing myself how I want to express myself, and what do I get? [Fucking sucker punched in the street, kicked, and called a faggot.](https://youtu.be/jEA3o7kHR9E)

It. Is. Scary. How. Calm. I. Am.

I should be pissed. I am pissed. But the waters are still calm. I don't understand this. This is a level of broken I never thought I would reach.

It's not even a bad broken. It's a liberating broken. It's a calm before the nuclear dinosaur of a storm being unleashed unto the world type of broken.

There's no container anymore. That shit got broke. This girl is full-fledged psycho now. But in a good way, with puppies and butterflies and a lot of deep throating.

Everyone in my family is stubborn so that if you tell us that we can't do something, we'll double down and get it done in a way you never thought possible. These fucking pricks want to remove my flavor of awesome from the world? Nuh-uh mother fucker! You get hyper-gay all over your shit when you try to keep me down.

I have all these fantasies about just going out and juggling and just being the most obnoxiously gay human being on the planet. I doubt my timid ass would be able to pull them off, but I'm using this as a catalyst, mark my word.

I've been kinda shy about talking how I want to talk or acting how I want to act. I literally open up the tiniest amount, and I become a victim. Well, fuck that. I'm not a victim. I refuse to go scurrying back to the place of fear I just walked away from. I'm going to radiate this light I have inside me, and I will shine brighter than anyone who carries even an ounce of hate in their hearts.

Fuck fear. Fuck it harder than I want to be fucked in the ass.

Question about the diference of transgender and transexual,"I've been recently been finding people who are deeply ignorant about the LGBT community, who bunch up all the queer spectrum into just one slur. I've also met people who are not ill intentioned, but simply do not understand trans folks and are very confused. You know, the kind of people who ask ""but what's in your pants????"" Obviously no one wants to deal with those, but I tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, and talk with them hoping they learn and understand the diference between gender and sex, and perhaps come to respect the identity of trans folks.   


What I wanted to get to is, is it relevant to explain the difference between transgender and transexual? I don't want to go around, sounding like an authority on the matter, since I'm cis and I don't have a better perspective. I'm afraid that by using that term I'd be alienating trans folks even further, or if it's even considered a slur, since I've rarely seen anyone identify themselves as transexual. I don't know what a good way to go about this would be.",ainbow

I finally met someone who's my type!,"type guys and as much as I hate to say it there are very little gay men like this. Every other gay man that I know is feminine in some way wether it be mannerisms, or interests. So last year the other out gay from my highschool (I'm going into college now) tried to ask me out and he wasn't feminine in terms of his mannerisms so I was thinking of giving him a chance but his interests were very feminine when we were talking and he told me his favorite things are drag race and real housewives also he ""religiously"" listened to madonna, cher, spears, and lana del ray and asked me if i did too. I politely told him no and I continued on with our conversation. I was turned off and told him that I just wanted to be friends. Later my date tried to set me up with his ex boyfriend who was very similar to him in the sense that they didn't have feminine mannerism per se but he wore makeup to cover up his blemishes and he does drag so I wasn't feeling it.

That gets me to college so last month me and the gay kid I went on a date with had freshman orientation (we're going to the same school), we both didn't really speak to eachother and I met this incoming football player he was known around his highschool for being a player ( apparently he banged a girl who was sitting next to us when we were making our schedules). So him and I were talking and he was telling me how hot some girl was, and then he asked me which girl I thought was hot so I told him I was gay. He then told me that he is bisexual but perfered women and we had a conversation for an hour about practically everything sports, sneakers, food, movies, comic books etc etc. At the end he gave me his number and told me to make sure to see him on the first day of college and we kissed. So now me and this guy are talking and i'm just glad I found a guy who's just overall very masculine",ainbow

What do you think is a better way to refer to our community than LGBTQ+? Doesn’t this term bother you?,"(Fair warning, I’m heavily medicated right now, so please be patient as I try to find the right words)

I’ve had this in my head for a long time now. I hate being referred to as LGBTQ+ like some agenda point at a meeting or some medicine nobody can pronounce. It makes the whole thing feel, LESS. Like it breaks us down into something that’s not just different but something set aside, over here, to be discussed on a committee with other people deciding our fates. It’s not inclusive (as a pansexual), and if ‘questioning’ is just a part of life than I don’t see why it’s included, and most of all, IT SOUNDS AWFUL. It can’t be said well, there’s no beauty to it, there’s no flow, it’s unattractive, and it honestly makes me feel like people are gonna think somethings wrong with us just by the nature of having to spout a bunch of consonants instead of saying something that sounds natural.

It bugs me that our community is one of the most artistic, expressive, beautiful, inspiring cultures I’ve ever seen, and we have this ugly blocky name that won’t go away. My distaste for it has only grown. Why don’t we insist on a term that shares that beauty?

For me, the word is Queer. It doesn’t have to be a bad word, just like Gay doesn’t have to be a bad word. It’s a beautiful word, it’s smooth, it’s easy to say, and it encompasses all these unconventional and unique patterns of life that each of us under the rainbow find ourselves discovering. Anyone who’s not a ‘traditional cis-gender heterosexual’ is basically Queer. It’s a word that we can easily claim as our own in a GOOD way. A word that can be GOOD, and doesn’t restrict anyone to simply being ‘T’ or ‘MTF’ or ‘LT’ or whatever round hole ones trying to be stuffed into. Why should we stuff ourselves into this ugly sounding box? LGBTQ+. I hate it! And I think it turns people away who may otherwise benefit from the support of the community because it just sounds too weird. Who wants to risk being called a bunch of odd-sounding letters instead of normal? I think it honestly keeps some people from speaking up about themselves.

It’s not how life works for us. Maybe you grow up as a cis-gay child to graduate identifying as a Trans-pansexual only to end up a happily straight-married drag queen. Our lives are a beautiful journey of self-discovery and inspiration, and for me, I’d rather be called queer than a pansexual-androgynous-male. Those inside shades you find are YOURS alone, not meant to be strapped across your chest as a public label so everyone ELSE can know your gender and sexual identity. It’s no one else’s business! Queer allows me to share things on my own terms, in my own time, on my own damn business.

So what do you think of this abbreviation crap and does it bother you as much as it bothers me?

"With the assault on Ariana Grande in the news, there should be a reminder to everyone that anyone can be a predator and anyone a victim, even in the gay community.","There is a misconception that GLBTQA persons can't be victimized by same sex predators, especially in the lesbian community. I just wanted to take the opportunity to remind people that:

You don't have to keep quiet about unwanted touching from a pastor, doctor, coach, police officer,  teacher,  parent,  best-friend, stranger,  etc. No one has a right to touch you inappropriately and yes, straight women can rape gay men, straight men or other women, trans people can be abused by doctors or police officers, the elderly can be assaulted by minors,  guys who identify and live as gay men can rape women, etc., etc.

Anyone can find themselves a victim at any given time,  and it's all equally vile. Shout out to Terry Crews, who stood up for male victims when he talked about his own experience.

If you find yourself a victim of a sexual crime,  please go the nearest emergency room or call a rape and abuse center in your area. The center will assign someone to go through the reporting process with you and will work as your advocate throughout your experience. You'll also be referred for legal and psychological help if you need it.  You can also call GLBTQA centers in your area,  and most will have referrals for services that you may need. 

You aren't alone and there are people that will support you if you are willing to come forward.  If you have past trauma that you never dealt with you can use many of the same resources to help you deal with the repercussions.  

Always remember,  if you survive an attack,  that was the main goal.  You did nothing wrong,  and are a survivor. Hugs!

Edit: I am 40 years old,  and I never really noticed I tend to say GLBT instead of LGBT. I'm sorry if anyone was offended in any way. It's pretty funny that I never consciously noticed the difference until now. Personally I think both are equal and I would hope the order of the letters don't really matter at who gets assistance in any way. ",ainbow

Having a hard time figuring out my sexuality,"Warning, this is a bit long a rambly. I just really need to let this out. 

Last year I discovered my attraction to women and that got me thinking a lot. I am really confused, I don't know what to think or do about this discovery.

I was raised in a Christian household so sexuality was always shunned, especially homosexuality. That's probably why it took me so long to acknowledge the female attraction. Even before figuring out liking girls I was ashamed of having any sort of attraction to people at all. I couldn't even handle liking guys and then I stumble upon this. I'm struggling.

I didn't go on my first date until I was eighteen years old. I probably could have gone on one before that but I was so scared of being shunned or made fun of by my deeply religious parents that I didn't even attempt to talk to guys in any romantic or flirty way.

In grade twelve, about three years ago, I would go to my church's youth group. I didn't really fit in with the g. 12 girls so I mostly hung out with the g. 12 guys. We hung out throughout the year, one of the guys even asked me out. I agreed to go to a movie with him but a few hours before I panicked bailed. Near the end of the year I got a text from one of guys. He said that the g. 12 guys had been talking and they were wonder amongst themselves whether I was A sexual or not and he wanted to know.

This hurt a lot. I don't know why. I really wanted to be able to show my interest in guys, show that I wasn't some A sexual weirdo who doesn't hang out with the other girls. I was so scared though, I didn't know anything except mockery and ridicule any time I actually showed interest in a person. That's was one of many times I've been asked if I am A sexual.

After graduating from highschool I was tired of not being able to date and show interest in people, so I downloaded tinder. I started going on dates but for some reason, any time a guy wanted to kiss me or get close to me or kiss me I would panic or make an excuse so I could leave. I don't know why. I'll be super chill and into it while making plans and text guys but when it comes time to actually meet them for the date I have a panic attack and really not want to go. I don't like bailing on people though so I go and uaually have an alright time.

It's weird how I'll have crushes, or what I think are crushes, on guys but I never like the people I end up going on dates with. I have been on dates with bunchs of guys but I have never once felt any romantic or sexual feelings towards them.

I want to be attracted to guys. Guys are awesome. I want to want to kiss them and be held by them and get married to one. Maybe I do. I really dont know what I want. I can imagine what it would be like to have those urges but anytime Im near a guy that I think is really awesome and handsome I don't feel that. I like spending time with guys and I want guys to want to spend time with me but I'm starting to think that all of that is just in a platonic way.

I hate all this.

I discovered reddit about three years ago and I've been on the site ever since, mostly lurking. I'd go to r/all and see the posts from the subreddits featuring naked women and I'd click on those posts and just stare at the girls. I don't really know what was going through my mind at that point. Maybe I was trying to see what it's like to be a guy. All I know is I told myself that I wasn't attracted to these girls. I kept clicking on the posts though and I would go to the subreddits and I started watching lesbian porn.

It still didn't click for me that I was attracted to these girls. I don't know how it didn't because I was watching fucking lesbian porn and staring at boobs.

It took meeting a girl and not being able to stop thinking about said girl for two solid years before figuring out that I like liked her and not just thought she was cool.

FUCK.

So I'm bisexual? Because obviously I have to be attracted to guys because I'm a girl and that is what I am supposed to like. But why do I never actually want to get physical with a guy? And I really want to kiss this girl? I really want to be attracted to guys. Is that just the hereonormative world I was raised in talking?

I'm so confused and I don't know what's going on. I am scared of actually finding the answers to all of the questions I have. I'm scared of what my parents will say. I'm scared that I can't accept myself.

I really want this all to go away. ",ainbow
Life affirming Eddy Izzard quote.,"Although I can't help but think of my favorite Eddy Izzard quote: ""I don't wear women's clothing. I wear my clothing. Women didn't go out and buy them. I did.""

It has been on my mind since I went clothes shopping yesterday. For reference, I'm a woman. I'm a bit weird on gender, but not so much that I feel uncomfortable identifying as a lady. A store attendant said ""honey, this is the men's section."" And then proceeded to direct me to the women's section. I politely walked back to the land of pockets. Later she asked if I was a cross-dresser. No, I just like comfy clothes that are actually useful. I might get a lovely pink top, but I'm going to wear it with an outdoorsy shirt. I lift weights so I actually have shoulders and I can't stand wearing a skirt (I don't need wind on the old clam)  or skinny jeans (I like moving). She was trying to be really sweet which made it more difficult.

What SPECIFICALLY made you know you weren’t straight?,"(throwaway account because my friends follow me on reddit)

I am a 16 year old male and I have been thinking a lot about my sexuality lately. I haven’t talked to any of my friends about this, but I think I might be either bi or gay. I really want to decide so I can confide in some of my friends, but I guess I just want to be sure?

My question for all if you is: How did you know you weren’t straight?

For example, something I believe might be pointing me in a homosexual direction is that I do enjoy watching gay porn as well as straight porn. I also haven’t had a crush on a girl since I was around 13. When I was younger, I also would get erections in the locker room when we were changing into swimsuits for our gym class. 

I don’t know if i’m just reading too much into things, or if I truly should consider committing myself to a sexuality other than straight. Please help a brother out :)

TLDR; I question my sexuality a lot as a result of my affinity for porn that isn’t with straight people in it and also because I get turned on when in situations with minimal clothing with other guys. Did anything similar happen to you to push you to define yourself as gay/bi?",ainbow
I just feel a need to talk about where I'm at right now,"Years ago, I figured out I wasn't cisgender, and started seeing myself as nonbinary. At first I just sometimes dressed more feminine, and did so more and more often over the years since. And recently, it's as if something inside me exploded(I don't know how else to put it). I don't feel fine in male clothes anymore, it just feels wrong. I can't stand male pronouns anymore, the way I could previously. Something has been growing and growing and now it's become so big I don't feel like I can express my female side by just clothes and make-up anymore. I'm not entirely sure if I'm nonbinary or if woman(Leaning towards woman) is a better label, but that's the least important bit.

I'm fortunate to have gathered a group of open minded friends, so I came out as nonbinary pretty quickly. The last few years, I've been mixing my genderexpression with my closest friends, and a few days ago I asked them, as well as a few people we all know that I'm not as close to, to start calling me by my chosen female name and using female pronouns.

I've made an appointment to talk about this, and maybe get to do HRT and all of that. It feels strange, only scary because I'll have to explain everything to my family. At least they know I'm not cisgender, even if I'm always seen as male by them, but it mostly feels exciting and good.",ainbow

"Goodbye, trans Reddit","I am leaving Reddit's trans community and deleting this account.

I'm posting this here because this has the widest audience of any of the LGBT+ subs I participate in. Yes, this is because of the drama in asktg. After what went on in the past week, I decided to leave the community. My original plan was to simply unsubscribe from asktg and go on to greener pastures. But I've found that I have difficulty letting go. I keep paying attention to what's been going on, and it's been destroying my mental health. I have lost massive amounts of sleep every single day over the past week, I can feel my heart racing all the time, and I'm having difficulty concentrating at work because I keep thinking about the drama. I have to move on, and deleting my account is the only way I can.

It absolutely tears me up to do this. It honestly feels like I'm killing a part of myself. I have a lot of memories in this account, and I mean *a lot*. She was only about two weeks away from her fifth cakeday. I was pre-everything and not even 100% sure I was trans when I created her, and I've come a long way since then. But the moment has been prepared for. I've spent hours tonight saving all my private messages, chats, saved posts, and any posts I've made that I want to remember (mostly early success stories and posts asking for advice on dealing with dysphoria) to disk.

Don't worry about me. I have a support network. I have friends in real life, I've been getting involved in my real-life trans community over the past few months, and I also made arrangements to continue talking to the one person I've been chatting with lately off of Reddit, because those conversations have been my only bright spots on Reddit in a long time. Besides, I don't need the support I've needed in the past. I'm effectively post transition now. Sure, I haven't changed the gender marker on my driver's license... but since I don't have a car, my passport is good enough. And while I do want to get an orchi and BA at some point in the future, it's so far off it's not even worth thinking about, and they're not nearly as important as being on HRT for years, going full time, getting my name changed, and getting my gender markers on my federal documents changed.

Trust me, my life is only going to get better after I delete this account. There's a lot about her that I'm going to miss, but there's also a ton I'm not going to miss, and I have to do this in order to move on with my life.

I want come out but that's hard.,"I'm currently at camp with my university, meeting a lot of people for first time. It's quite alright, they drink a lot when I don't do it at all but there still fun things to do. Regardless LGBTQ people are essential fairies around there. Possibly for someone being attacked to same gender is often played for laughs but, for someone to actually be gay or bi, that's unheard of, let alone trans, fluid or something else LGBTQ. Essentially few belive they maybe really. While I'm still unsure about myself but I wanted to come out as fluid, give myself some room to experiment and such. Except when I try coming out it just isn't acknowledged. I don't know, I don't feel too strongly about it but it still saddening. I don't know is there is something I should do to make it clear them it's not a joke and if I'm comfortable doing that. ",ainbow

Telephone Voice Confusion,"I'm used to people making fun of my voice from a young age. I guess it would be feminine as my dad has a soft voice too. But as of recently answering phone calls at work everyone assumes I'm a woman even after giving my name. They still refer to me as Miss and them I have to explain I'm guy makes the whole thing awkward. So sometimes I don't even bother correcting them.

How Do I Gay?,"You know that feeling when you spaghetti so hard you tear a hole in the space time continuum and you don't know if you should try to reach out and try to correct it or if you've reached levels of autism never before achieved on this plane of existence and you've doomed yourself to never have friends again?

Well, my one friend, arguably my only actual friend, has been super nice to me. He and his roommates even set up a game of munchkin to enable a series of events that let them ""argue"" about gender for a bit and make me feel really comfortable expressing myself in front of them.

I think I fucked things up, because after doing some really nice things for me, like things I've never experienced from anyone except people I was dating, I felt compelled to reach out and thank him with a letter. Well, I sent it to him and I haven't heard anything back. I joked a bit in the letter, but nothing more than what I've already written about in a story series I was hired to write for his band ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/94vvre/pi_phasers_engage_archetypes_part_1_2143_words/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/98tci5/pi_phasers_engage_archetypes_part_2_2559_words/), if interested). He and his roommates all make really flamboyant jokes and seem to flirt with each other, but maybe I'm just retarded. It would not be the first time I've fucked up in epic proportions.

I barely know how to socialize, let alone gay. I have a crippling fear of rejection due to abandonment issues revolving my mother's death. I've never felt comfortable reaching out to someone and telling them how I feel when it comes to being attracted to them or feeling for them. I feel horrible right now because I don't know if I ruined our friendship or what.

I feel so alone; trapped in my head while the world passes by me. I want to scream. I don't know how to talk to guys or attract them to me. I'm just starting my journey to becoming a woman, so I'm still presenting as a guy. How do I do this? 

Also, how would I fix this with my friend if I did step over a boundary? How do I recognize boundaries when my brain don't work right to tell me what is or isn't appropriate?",ainbow

Horrible Depression!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"So I need to vent. I grew up in a heavily Christian family in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. I've wanted to move out of my parents house for a long-ass time - since I was fifteen (I'm nineteen now.) I'm still in college, so I decided to transfer to a different college in the state. Unfortunately, I do not have my own place to stay, so I'm staying with my crazy two aunts who live in the area just until I find a roommate. However, I have not had as much luck as I had hoped with the roommate situation. I thought, ""Hey, I'll be able to move out of my aunt's house in a couple days!"" Wrong! I've been here a week, and it seems like I'll have to stay with my aunts for a few more weeks. I also just found out that the job I got hired for only pays minimum wage. On top of that, I don't have anyone to talk to. My brothers, who I thought were interested in me, haven't returned my calls or texts, even though I've tried to contact them repeatedly. The gay scene in this city is terrible. You know when you open up Grindr and it's just the same creepy old men? Yeah, that sums up my current situation. What do you guys think? Am I making too much out of my brothers not answering my calls or texts, or do I have a right to be offended? Should I regret this move, or quit complaining and suck it up?",ainbow

Semistry app. Help us refine the most advanced sexuality app out there.,"Hello, we're a small team of developers and sex educators and we've created a really fun and unique sexual knowledge app (it's not porn or a social site!) and are looking for feedback and constructive criticism.

It's called **Semistry**, and it's an app about sexual self-knowledge- developing how we understand sex, and ultimately ourselves (iPhone Only at the moment). There really isn't anything else like it:

· The Semistry Sex Index holds the largest collection of sexual activities in the world- over 1800 references and growing- organized by theme, difficulty and rarity.

· Calculate your Sexual Experience Metric- SEM score- by quantifying your sexual history. The SEM score is a numeric representation of one's experience variability-  each country has their own SEM averages for their population groups.

· Track and compare individual sexual partners and organizes your sexual relationships in the Semistry Diary- the evolution of the ""Little Black Book"".

By encouraging sexual self-knowledge, we seek to break taboos, promote tolerance, and enhance the sexual experience. Its an always updating digital encyclopedia of modern sex. 

I've added some links bellow, and will give out free promo codes for upgrading the app if you message us.

An apology,"A while ago on this sub, I said a wholeee bunch of naive and stupid shit

I would like to apologise.

Since then (and it has been a while) I've been reflecting and thinking, and I've realised that a lot of what I said massively ignored and marginalised the members of our community who weren't as self assured as I, who weren't in as safe and accepting an environment as I have the good fortune to live in, and who are fighting the good fight to be recognised and treated fairly.

My sheltered, privileged white-boy ass is still growing and learning, and I hoped anyone I offended could forgive me. 

(I know this is all *a bit* melodramatic, and I'm not out here expecting y'all to suddenly be congratulating me for becoming less of an insufferable wanker; quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if this was downvoted to oblivion or just plain ignored but… I wanted to get it off my chest.)",ainbow

Going To My First Lesbian Wedding!,"This weekend is going to be a very special weekend for my friends and family. On Saturday, a close relative of mine, who I've known all my life, is getting married on the beach in an event that promises to cap off the summer in the best possible way. I've been to my share of weddings before, but I've never been to a lesbian wedding or a beach wedding, for that matter. And I'm very excited to share the experience.

This relative of mine is one of the sweetest, most charismatic individuals of any gender that I've ever known. She's also someone who has never been too shy about her sexuality. She didn't really try to hide it and it was never too big a deal with my family. She's always been her own person and her sexuality is just part of that.

Everyone, especially her parents, are thrilled that she's found someone special. I'm happy for her too because she's someone who knows how to work for someone's love. She's willing to put in the effort, physically and emotionally. I think she and her wife are going to have a great life together.

She's giving me a chance to speak at the ceremony. I intend to give a little speech and read a poem I wrote for her. I want it to be as memorable as possible.

I have a pretty good idea of what I want to say, but if anyone has any tips for giving a speech at a lesbian wedding, I'd love to hear it. If anyone has any jokes or icebreakers I could start with, I'd really appreciate that. Here's hoping this will be an event to remember for all the right reasons.",ainbow

Any MtF/FtM transfolk Just Want To Talk?,"Hi, I'm bi, 46/F, she/her, and kind of a loner. I find myself with questions for those who identify as transgender, but I don't have anyone in my circle of local friends who identifies that way. So...would any trans folks like to make a new friend? :) I have questions, but I don't want to make it seem like a rude interrogation; I want to know about you!  

Back when I was in college, I used to be in the campus LGBT club. Do any of you attend your campus club?  Do you feel like it's an inclusive group? Or do you feel like the inclusiveness is nominal? I enjoyed the time I was active in my campus group, but it seemed more geared toward the 'L&amp;G' section of the group, and the 'B&amp;T' folks were left to fend for themselves. 

There was no 'genderqueer' in the 90's. I didn't hear that term until the 2000's. So that's how it \*was\*. Does it still feel that way? I feel like things are still weighted toward L&amp;G dominance in the community, but trans people are finally having their moment in the sun, that moment of recognition.

More questions. Do you feel like people just want to talk about sex or sexual topics, and they're less interested in who you are as a young person? Like: ""Oh wow, you're taking hormones and you have titties now, did you have bottom surgery yet????"", when all you really want is to focus on your studies, or your future career, or what you're going to have for lunch, or ANYTHING else?

I feel like there's a lot of loneliness out there with those who identify as bi, or genderqueer, or asexual or trans. It's like people forget that gender identity is just one small component, and because of that, there's some reluctance there for others to become friendly. A shyness, if you will. Some people can overcome it but a lot of people can't.

Wanna talk? Holla. Or I'll keep using the word 'holla'. And maybe make you cringe.  :)  ",ainbow

What is pansexual exactly?,"Maybe this belongs on r/explainliveimfive. I am a bisexual man, I have a transgender sister (man to woman), and I am very accepting in general. Assuming that the LGBT community believes that a transgender person truly is the gender they identify as (which I tend to), then what is pansexual? I mean isn’t that just bisexual then? I for example like men, women, and transgender people alike, but I feel that someone who transitioned man to woman is just a woman, I don’t see them as a trans person but just as a woman, perhaps trapped inside a man’s body, but a woman nonetheless. So that would make me bisexual, I like men and women. Sorry if I sound ignorant, I probably am. No intent to disrespect anyone here btw, I’m just curious.",ainbow

Help to change a coworkers view,"I'm going to preface this by saying I work in an environment with language that's definitely not PC. This story has been trimmed of anything I think would be offensive and isn't important. That being said, I'm not exactly on the up and up with LGBT terms, do's and dont's, etc., but I don't discriminate unless somebody has a bad work ethic. Now, story time.

I was at work yesterday when somebody came up and told me G ""just spent like 10 minutes talking about how they don't like gay people."" I work loosely with G as they're in another department, but we often work with each other on small projects, up to a few times a week.

I started talking to G about their thoughts, and it seems to me like G basically doesn't understand homosexuality. G said things like ""it doesn't make sense logically,"" and ""a humans natural instincts are to procreate, and homosexuality defeats that purpose."" I countered with some old theory I read years ago that went something like ""it could be an evolutionary trait that came about to stop a species from overpopulation."" Whether that's still a theory or if it's right or wrong, I don't know. But it had an impact.

G says they think logically, and it seems to G that homosexuality is illogical. G doesn't believe in God, so any religious argument would likely be useless here. I feel that I understand why G thinks this way, and as such, I have a decent chance at changing their mind on this subject. From the talk I had with G at work, they seem likely to take any facts into account and actually change their view based on evidence presented. I'm here because I don't have enough evidence to give G, and am asking for anything that a person might find to be a logical explanation as to why homosexuality exists. I can't just tell G they're wrong or stupid, or say something like ""it doesn't have to be logical because it's just how people are and people aren't logical,"" or some other cliche like that for obvious reasons. Any help would be appreciated!",ainbow
Finding like-minded friends,"Hey everyone - here is a question from a guy who identifies as straight but knows sexuality is more fluid than just gay vs straight. I'm 32 years old, with a long term girlfriend who I live with and am very happy with. I've had a number of relationships in the past with other women which were (mostly) rewarding in their own ways, and by no means have I questioned my dating preferences over the years.

However - I have had the urge for a long time now to experience getting off with another guy. I know mutual masturbation is a normal thing teenagers do to experiment, but I never found myself in that situation as a teen. I can't picture myself bringing it up with any of my friends (most of if not all are in committed relationships as well), and am not particularly interested in the idea of someone random. I've realized I'm looking for some sort of sexual bond with another man but not as a romantic partner or even a 'casual hookup'. More like a friend I can be super open with. Also, I've had opportunities in the past for MFM threesomes but they never fell through.

My biggest issue is I don't even know where to look to meet someone in the same boat. I am afraid I will regret not experiencing at least something like this while I'm still reasonably young and confident in myself. I am not sure how to bring up the subject and discuss it with my partner (which I absolutely would before ever doing anything).

Any suggestions would be awesome! Hope this is the right audience.",ainbow

Too Young To Understand What Pansexual is?,"Hey, so the other day I posted something on my private story on my Snapchat account that I was pansexual. And I had only my closest friends on there so I thought I could trust them. Turns out I can’t. Someone told someone else and it eventually got to my mom.

So now my mom thinks that I just posted that I was pansexual just to start a rumor or become more popular. I don’t understand why she would think that but okay. She also thinks I’m too young to understand what pansexual is or even to understand what bisexual is. I do understand what both of those are though. I don’t know what to do. 

She keeps trying to talk to me about it and I’m not ready to talk about it. She won’t leave me alone about. She said that she will have to take away all my social media. And honestly I’m just being comfortable with my sexuality and I guess she can’t understand that.

My mom also said that I can talk to her if I’m confused about anything because she will listen and that it’s not good to just keep your feelings inside. So if it’s bad to keep my feelings inside why can’t I tell people? 

The thing that is angering me the most is that there are 5 year olds coming out as transgender but I’m too young to understand what being pan and bi are.
