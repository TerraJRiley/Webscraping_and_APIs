</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background and start with 4d4 x 10 gp.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Expertise"> Expertise </span></h2>
<p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sneak_Attack"> Sneak Attack </span></h2>
<p>Once per turn, you can deal extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Thieves.27_Cant"> Thieves' Cant </span></h2>
<p>During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cunning_Action"> Cunning Action </span></h2>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Uncanny_Dodge"> Uncanny Dodge </span></h2>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Evasion"> Evasion </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reliable_Talent"> Reliable Talent </span></h2>
<p>By 11th level, whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blindsense"> Blindsense </span></h2>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stroke_of_Luck"> Stroke of Luck </span></h2>
<p>At 20th level, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cantrips">Cantrips</span></h4>
<p>You learn three cantrips: <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Mage_Hand" title="Mage Hand">Mage Hand</a> and two other cantrips of your choice from the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_Spells" title="Wizard Spells">wizard spell list</a>. At 10th level you learn another cantrip from the wizard spell list.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Slots">Spell Slots</span></h4>
<p>The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
</p><p>You start with two 1st-level spell slots at Rogue level 3, and gain more as you gain more Rogue levels.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells_Known">Spells Known</span></h4>
<p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list. The third can be from any school of magic.
</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mage_Hand_Legerdemain">Mage Hand Legerdemain</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Mage_Hand" title="Mage Hand">Mage Hand</a>, you can make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:
</p>
<ul><li> You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.
</li><li> You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
</li><li> You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.
</li></ul>
<p>You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creatures Wisdom (Perception) check.
</p><p>In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to control the hand.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Magical_Ambush">Magical Ambush</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Versatile_Trickster">Versatile Trickster</span></h3>
<p>At 13th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature within 5 feet of your Mage Hand. Doing so gives you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Thief">Spell Thief</span></h3>
<p>At 17th level, immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st-level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell, can cast it using your spell slots, and the creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.
</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

<p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certificates to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
</p><p>Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impostor">Impostor</span></h3>
<p>At the 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least three hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Death_Strike">Death Strike</span></h3>
<p>Starting at the 17th level, when you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

<p>At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Steady_Eye">Steady Eye</span></h3>

<p>Beginning at 13th level, as an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.
</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eye_for_Weakness">Eye for Weakness</span></h3>
<p>At 17th level, while your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature increases by 3d6.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Insightful_Manipulator">Insightful Manipulator</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
</p>
<ul><li> Intelligence score
</li><li> Wisdom score
</li><li> Charisma score
</li><li> Class levels (if any)
</li></ul>
<p>At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Misdirection">Misdirection</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 13th level, when you are targeted by an attack, while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Soul_of_Deceit">Soul of Deceit</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, you can present false thoughts by succeeding on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.
</p><p>Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sudden_Strike">Sudden Strike</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 17th level, if you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action.

</p><p>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
