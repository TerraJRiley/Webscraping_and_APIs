People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.",12/19/2017 06:07 AM,"{""id"":""207590682540"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":9,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207438106439"",""name"":""Osprey""}}",post-19,4473 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Osprey-11747,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000197B.png,Girl Gamers,1000

It will be true when people stop bullying girls for being girls. Until this, problem should be highlighted to be noticed and fixed.
One of the reasons some people bully girls is because many feel the need to identify themselves as ""girl gamers"", which is annoying and unnecessary.

e: I should clarify I'm not condoning bullying of any kind.

my guy I get bullied for being a girl the moment I say anything in team chat. it’s not a “well girls are labeling themselves as girl gamers so that’s why they’re getting harassment”, I’m getting harassment for just talking. I’m lucky and have a deep voice and most of the time they think I’m a boy, people with higher voices (and boys with high pitched voices get made fun of too) don’t get that.",12/19/2017 06:34 AM,"{""id"":""207591581480"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207519477502"",""name"":""issh0man""}}",post-31,2806 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/issh0man-1306,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D58.png,Girl Gamers,1000

I would not say harassment is equivalent to everyone. People will get harassed for different things and that is inherently not equivalent. The person who plays for like 1600 hours will get harassed for playing too much while the newbie will get harassed for not being that good. You can't really be targeted for playing too much if you literally have like <1 hr of play.

No, he is complaining about mentioning gender. And yes, they are doing it right by mentioning their gender - this way they are talking about the problem.

For males more easy answer is ""hahaha, calm down, there is no problem, you are exaggerating"" - just because ignoring this issue will not hurt them (us, I'm a male) and doesn't require any additional actions or changes.
People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.


If you face similar bullying you should understand how tiring it is for someone to hear your voice, once, and to immediately be faced with backlash.

It isn't a matter of muting them, or turning a blind eye, or even leaving the game, because that doesn't stop them. Their goal is to make you uncomfortable. It's not funny, it's not something you can ignore, it's freaking exhausting.",12/19/2017 07:13 AM,"{""id"":""207590482405"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207579296002"",""name"":""Poe""}}",post-45,43 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Poe-11501,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000030B.png,Girl Gamers,1000

""Equality"" hasn't been about being equal for at least a decade.

that's because everyone nowadays wants to be more Equal than the person next to them

it's one of few things that actually bother me about society as a whole nowadays

a little while back some people on the internet decided to put up signs that said

""it's ok to be white.""

even made it a point to make it as non threatening as possible handwriting and design wise

the news media villainized the whole thing treating it as if it were an act of terrorism made by the worst of the worst kind of racists

schools where the sign was placed went as far as to say something to the effect of ""we don't share the views of the signs in question""

after i saw that i just slamed my face so hard into my palm that it slipped off and broke the nearest desk i'm not even kidding you can look it up

Most of us feel that way. Especially those of us that were bullied as a kid.

It seems to me they're upset because of the specific nature of the verbal taunts, rather than the fact that they're being verbally taunted.

Most of us feel that way. Especially those of us that were bullied as a kid.

It seems to me they're upset because of the specific nature of the verbal taunts, rather than the fact that they're being verbally taunted.

Which to me makes almost no difference, but then again that's the male perspective, and you can't just overright female perspective entirely either.

""I'm not sexist, but...""

But yes, I agree, people think the same way about mercy mains & girl gamers in this community: they don't like them and treat them like trash, yet expect them to be around to pick them back up.


I'm 100% sure if most people treated mercy mains like trash they wouldn't play the game, especially not with their voice as a girl.

Especially not in this meta where she's viable. I've seen people beg for a mercy in like half my games this season, they're very much appreciated, at least from my experience this season.

In game, yes.

Because that's not how things work. Targeting specific things is how things get solved, and how in depth discussions occur.

Would you have told a suffragette that they shouldn't be focusing on women being able to vote and instead focusing on civil rights for everyone? Would you say that the NAACP and other groups that target discrimination towards specific groups shouldn't exist, because they should just all be one big group against all discrimination?Would you tell someone trying to save one forest that they shouldn't be doing that because they should save all the forests?

Yeah, all issues should be addressed, but telling them that they're wrong for wanting to address specific aspects of a problem just distracts from actually solving anything.

Activists specialize for a reason. People fight for specific causes for a reason. If everyone tried to fix everything at once, nothing would get solved. Progress is won by passion, and passion works best in a concentrated form.

I'm a Gay Gamer

I'm a Black Gamer

I'm a White Gamer

No because that's ridiculous to ask of a single person

if they have the power to save all the forests they still shouldn't stop saving the forest in question that would be self defeating if you plan on saving ALL of the forests

Only if they waste time debating it and don't actually listen in the end~

If everyone tried to fix everything at once, nothing would get solved. You can't win a war without fighting battles first.


there are a few issues with this focusing on the female side of toxicity isn't even fighting a proper battle but instead just a skirmish and it doesn't solve anything alone the problem will still persist and at some point a portion of females will start to take advantage of their new vantage point especially if it's poorly handled and trust me it will be poorly handled

the difference between then and now is we humans have access to the internet we can change things much faster than ever before we are all connected together

that whole forest thing? somewhere in the world there has to be at least 1000 Like minded individuals who could work together to accomplish much more than what that 1 person could possibly do multiplicativly

Civilrights would take a bit longer because people are insufferable sometimes especially when it comes to politics >.>

No, he is complaining about mentioning gender. And yes, they are doing it right by mentioning their gender - this way they are talking about the problem.

For males more easy answer is ""hahaha, calm down, there is no problem, you are exaggerating"" - just because ignoring this issue will not hurt them (us, I'm a male) and doesn't require any additional actions or changes.
People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.

"2-2-2 is the standard, you can branch off from there depending on who is on your team and the map, but we need it. The game to game variation is too high because the matchmaker doesnt care what hero's you play.

One team get's a good comp, one team gets 6 DPS. Whether you climb or fall that day depends on how lucky you get rather than how well you are playing.

Evenutally they are going to do it, just like when the community said that we wanted hero limits, and they gave in, the game got better for it. The question is how long do we have to put up with the most random feeling ladder that I've ever played.

You pick two, could even be the same thing twice
1. Main tank
2. Off Tank
3. DPS
4. Support
5. Flex (you pick your main role but then are willing to have any as the second role)

This would be good foundation for any team.

2-2-2 is the standard, you can branch off from there depending on who is on your team and the map, but we need it. The game to game variation is too high because the matchmaker doesnt care what hero's you play.

One team get's a good comp, one team gets 6 DPS. Whether you climb or fall that day depends on how lucky you get rather than how well you are playing.

Evenutally they are going to do it, just like when the community said that we wanted hero limits, and they gave in, the game got better for it. The question is how long do we have to put up with the most random feeling ladder that I've ever played.

You pick two, could even be the same thing twice
1. Main tank
2. Off Tank
3. DPS
4. Support
5. Flex (you pick your main role but then are willing to have any as the second role)

This would be good foundation for any team. You are free to build it from there but you atleast know you have players willing to fill the main roles decreasing the team to team variation.It wouldnt be perfect and you would still get the off meta one tricks that could put you at a disadvantage but alteast you have the rest covered.

From there you could build a deathball, triple tank, cheese, etc.

you can already find that out. The issue is when it throws to many mercy mains, to many DPS, or to many tank mains on one team when the other team has a nice mix

"even tho jeff believes sombra is fine

i still think she needs more attention, there is a reason she is least popular character in ranked mode on any rank, right?

this season i decided to main her and i got 3890 which was my highest raiting ever, but before that i trained like 30 hours on her

so i can say she really needs more work, sometimes i felt like just bein irritated coz when u play her so much u can feel how raw the hero is

my opinion on sombra:
either let her go insta stealth which will make her way more survivable and mobile, coz often enemy simply sees when u go in stealth and shoots in ur fading figure
or atleast let u receieve some specific damage to be out of stealth. Often i dont want to use my TP in order to drop behind enemy, i want to enter the point in stealth, but random fart from enemy just make u go out of stealth instantly.

Let sombra get specific amount of damage before stop her hack. Its not that simply to hack enemy coz always someon would notice u and attack u before u do, Usually the front like is the most important to hack, but the best odds to hack smn only in the backline. Worst thing mid fight u just waste time on tryin to hack smn, there is always random damage interrupts u, or rapid move of the enemy,
SO either should be more dmn to hack enemy, or atleast mili second less hack cast time.

Make her TP like tracer \ moira work. This travelin time just really really bad in terms of mobility

COnsiderin that she does the lowest damage among all offensive heroes, and her ultimate doesnt even damage, On top of that her ultimate is extremely situational and doesnt gurantee u a kill, I beleive sombra really needs a work

The best and fair way to increase her pickrate and usefullness in the game is simply lettin her hack soldier and genji ultimates.
THose are the dedliest ultimates in game, yet u can hack only the worst ulties
which are easily stoppable by anything else like mcree;s or pharah;s",12/19/2017 01:21 PM,"{""id"":""207590482577"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207578454542"",""name"":""sharla""}}",post-7,44 posts,,https://us.battle.net/forums/static/images/avatars/overwatch/avatar-overwatch-default.png,"Why is Sombra being ignored, But Mercy gets rapid changes",1000

"I know this is a subject that not many of you care about but I find this quite ridiculous. Getting the achievements is rarely about skill, and more about RNG, or actually coordinating with the enemy team, or just basic trolling.

Just now, I played Sym to get her 20 TP achievements... had been trying it fair and square for 2 days straight, but you either get rekt or you destroy the enemy before you can actually get to your 4th TP. So I just put the TP in front of the spawn and walked 6 times through it to get the achievement, not helping my team at all. I would usually report people like that, but there is really no other way.

Achievements should give you a feeling of accomplishment and make you feel proud of the spray you get along with it. Not make you feel ashamed you threw multiple games hard just to farm it. it should be a feasible but hard challenge.

Also, the game is so old now, that most people know how to react to Ult's. Getting 4x kills with Ults is more about luck than skill. You need to play against a bad team, with no Tanks, if possible no healers, and hope for them to be stupid enough to group up when they hear an Ult. Zarya is probably your only chance of seriously accomplishing those but that's still ok, it is a challenge now I guess.

However, there are achievements related to reworks that are close to impossible. D.Va's DM achievement is ridiculous now that her DM uptime has been halved, but the damage has not.

Its technically possible, just a lot more difficult. Have to send someone on the other team a private message via PSN/XBL and ask them that way. Only really works if the other team is a group of 6 so you know they can relay the message to everyone.

I managed to get that one in the heat of the battle, I was on fire and I felt incredibly proud to get that one, but just like you there are some I got which were ridiculous in the way that I got them (I got Widow's flying headshot achievment by shooting in a standing position but because I was in the middle of stairs, it counted as me being in the air... woooohooo)

Also What I don't get, why force us to get it in QP? if, in order to get these achievements we need to collude with the enemy team, why not allow us to get them in custom games? at least that way we don't ruin the matches for people that actually want to play a normal match and not farm achievements... it feels wrong is basically what I'm trying to say and I would love a reaction from the devs, but I guess this won't get enough traction to get there.",12/19/2017 12:56 PM,"{""id"":""207590482565"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207433781348"",""name"":""Rohkah""}}",post-12,812 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Rocca24_7,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000010BB.png,Achievement? more like Trolling,1000

Mass Rez wouldn’t have to be every 30 seconds. Make her ult charge slower than previous. Right now unless you have ult or your team has the advantage it’s too much of a risk to try and get a Rez off mid battle.

I think the difference is you have the ability to alter the end result of the game, where as in gambling you can do nothing to alter your odds or the end result

it's just a skin, it's not going to affect your gameplay.


Actually it does affect your game play subliminally. It's known that gamers that doesn't get any type of 'satisfaction' whether it's beating a boss, getting an item, grinding for gear etc will lose significant interest in the game over time, thus affecting how one may view and play the game in a slight depressed way.

If a player continues to play but is continually dissatisfied time after time, the players view of the game will slowly impact negatively thus resulting in multiple negative behaviours such as bad game play, bad decisions etc etc

Sure the game gives out cosmetic items that doesn't effect the heroes abilities, hit boxes etc, but it's a form of gambling and gaming retention that Blizzard offers to players to keep playing. Overwatch in itself is a casino, they gain more than losses.

But hey people don't understand human, cognitive behaviours will not understand my post and how games do affect a player and their 'skill'.",12/19/2017 06:41 AM,"{""id"":""207591083180"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":19,""voteDown"":9},""author"":{""id"":""186032272453"",""name"":""hasher22""}}",post-4,2305 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/hasher22-1879,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D61.png,1 to 1.5 hour to get 1 loot box,1000

There's no way you can get 1 in 45 minutes. Well, I never played in a group, so I'm not sure. But when I solo.. It is always 1 hour to 1.5 hour to get one.

COmp games take twice as long as QP games, so they give twice as much XP, with a small caveat. In QP, if you don't leave the queue, you'll get a small bonus that you won't recieve in Comp as often.

"I am usually playing about 1-2h per day after work which means that I gather enough items and credits to get everything I want without spending money. If you only play during events however you will probably have a hard time since you are missing so many other items that are not from the event.

I mean you've got quite a high level but when I was your level I had 16k credits to spend for example which is more than enough to get everything, if you also keep playing and get the arcade lootboxes.

Every event since the rework of the lootboxes, I had to get about 30-50 boxes to get everything from last and this year which is about 30-50h roughly over 3 weeks. This equals about 2-3h per day and if I spend credits too I'll usually hit that ""only duplicates"" after about two weeks of an event.

This event I am extremely unlucky but so far I pulled the Bastion skin and Zarya emot and have about 8k credits left after about 23 lootboxes (played about 20h over the last 7 days).

It's so disheartening to farm for hours on end, see the gold circle pop out, get super excited then it's like ""oh 500 currency"" or ""oh a skin from the base game"". With how rare legendary drops are 500 for coins seems like too little to give out.


imo legendary coins during events > non-event legendaries. at least the coins can go towards a valuable purchase.",12/19/2017 10:48 AM,"{""id"":""207591083377"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207576341911"",""name"":""tpfang56""}}",post-18,289 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/tpfang56-1858,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000F00.png,1 to 1.5 hour to get 1 loot box,1000

I can get one in 45 minutes of qp. Most times qp is stupid af that you can hard carry games. But it fluctuates to an hour sometimes.

That is the fastest I can do though, not sure if more can be done in custom or arcade.


There's no way you can get 1 in 45 minutes. Well, I never played in a group, so I'm not sure. But when I solo.. It is always 1 hour to 1.5 hour to get one. A 20-25+ minutes comp game usually give 3-5k exp. Let's say 5k. Then you need 4 rounds of 20-25+ minutes comp game. That's already way over an hour. (not counting queue time)

Well I did say I can get it with 45 minutes of quick play. Competitive it's nearly impossible to get a loot box in that time. On a bad day I'll get a box in 2 hours, with leavers delaying games.

Then how about releasing more purple skins?
You know..
The semi affordable ones?

Not just another dump of 5-10 legendaries nobody has the money for.

Or how about some actual non-timegated skins for a change, we've gotten how many by now?
I know reinhardt got one or so, but they can't total more than a couple.

I'm dead. Another day of 4-5 hrs of farming got 0 legendary. There really needs a way to farm this crap without spending so much energy in. Like in some MMO game, I could farm while watching tv.. but this? I have to actually play or I get reported and banned. yes i'm complaining. I'm tired of spending money every season to get the skins and emotes I want.

I don't have the time to play everyday, and 8 hrs a day. At most I can get is 1 or 2 legendary skin farming at 2-4 hrs a day till end of event. This is by experience from past events. I feel like the event should be for ppl that actually put in hours to get. Not luck :( Is not like we can trade skins and emotes? Why should it based on luck. There is no value in them, cuz u cant trade. It only discourage the ppl that got unlucky to continue playing. If we put in the hours, we should get at least 1 legendary in 5 hours of playing.

"These changes to Symmetra and how shield health works in the game would be amazing to test on the PTR to see how they play out, plz Blizzard, try and make Symmetra more flexible and viable, like what these changes would do.
Turrets:
1: Turret damage reduced from 30 per second to 15 per second
2: Turret range increased from 10 to 15 meters
3: Turret placing distance increased from 5 to 10 meters
4: Turret casting time decreased from 1.4 seconds to 1 second
5: Movement speed during turret casting time increased by 25%
6: Each turret now has 30 shield health (see change to shield health below)
Photon Barrier:
1: Symmetra Photon Barrier health reduced from 1025 HP to 800 HP
2: Additional Barrier added to shield to provide more protection
3: Symmetra can now choose to either toss her Photon barrier out like she does now, or place it on the ground instead
Energy Ball (Secondary Fire):
1: Charge time reduced from 2 seconds to 1.8 seconds
Shield Gen/Teleporter:
1: Ally players can now see Shield Gen/ Teleporter through walls
2: Shield Gen/ Teleporter now make no noise (call outs regarding the ultimate are the same)
3: Shield Gen/Teleporter have a brighter shield bar than normal that regen's at 20 health per second (stronger version of shield health change implemented below)

"With the recent bug fixes that Doomfist got, I see him more and more in competitive. But, it seems to me that my DPS teammates have forgotten how to counter this fisting annoyance (even if they are his alleged counters).

So, most of the time I have a choice: stay healer and be fisted all of the time or play Sombra. But, there are times when I am solo healing and I can’t really switch to Sombra and let my team have 0 healers.

My question is: how can I deal with Doomfist while I’m playing healers (and Symmetra)?

Until now, I successfully dealt with him only as Zen, if he is relatively far away from me (out of fisting range) and Symmetra (but only if I have my turrets backing me up). Sure, I know that he can be slept, but I have yet to successfully kill Doomfist with Ana after that.

"Well with Mercy, listen to adio qeues when he's charging up his fist and GA away before he attacks (takes a bit of practice).
Same with Moira, you can bait the RP with fade if you time it right and you can usually get him to retreat if you throw a dmg orb and damage him a bit. With her, you can stay out of range for most of his abilities.
Ana is difficult. You can sleep him but don't try to solo him afterwards (RP will be off CD again). I'd say just use the time he's asleep to get away, try to get to a tank which can body block or absorb his RP or uppercut.
Zen is risky, you need to hit your headshots reliably, otherwise you are dead.

However, Mercy you can bait his abilities and if you attack him from range, he has to close the gap and that lets you have a short period of time to fire at him and get him low.
Zen, discord him and do the same.
Ana has her sleep dart and bio grenade which are useful, I'd say, in ensuring she can stay alive.
Moira can bait his abilities well, as well as using her orbs to either damage DF or heal herself.

Her ultimate (shield generator) should add +50 health shield (instead of 75 currently) but to everything :

-Her allies
-What their allies are summoning

More precisely :

-Sym Turrets got +50 shield generator (not OP as it seem : check heroes damage such Winston, Moira orb, Biotic grenade etc.).

-Torbjorn turret

-Orisa Protective barrier & Supercharger

-Winston Barrier Projector

-Mei Ice Wall

-WM Venom Mine

"According to most, the roles are meant to tell how you should play a hero and if they suit the playstyle you want. However, some heroes like Symmetra and Sombra could fall into multiple categories, and heroes like Hanzo and Junkrat can work on attack despite being defense heroes. I think that slightly reworked categories could more accurately pin what a hero's playstyle is and their role.

There could still be 4 categories, but it's instead divided into:
Assault/Offense: Role is to do damage, get picks, and storm the objective. Includes most of the same heroes in offense like Tracer, Reaper, etc., but also a couple added in like Hanzo and Junkrat.
Support: Role is to ""support"" the team by guarding objectives and assisting allies. Includes builders, defense heroes, and other back-line heroes, like Sombra, Symmetra, Mei, etc.

not sure if there is a dedicated section to discuss this kind of stuff, but I had this idea in mind since a while, and when I saw the Luc hero prototype it just came back.

In short, my idea was a character able to ""resurrect"" the enemies instead of the allies: they will behave as a kind of ""Zombie AI"" for the duration of the re-spawn time of the player, and then they'll decay.

It's a sort of ""spawn minions"" kind of ability that I think we all wants, but plus it helps to mitigate and counter the Mercy's rez.

The problem with this is that then what happens if you kill someone who is under half health. You can get some 49% of their life gone, get the final blow and then someone else gets the credit. It sounds good the way you phrased it, sure, but in an actual match you could get a triple kill with an ultimate and no credit for any of them. How is that any more fair than what we currently have?

Aren't there a number of maps which certain heros excel on? Like a couple of the Lijiang maps are really good for Pharah/Lucio. Illios Well is pretty good for Pharah/Lucio/Roadhog and Orisa. Blizzard World is going to be pretty good for Widow and Hanzo. Some heroes are just really good on certain maps, it's not just a thing in Chateau.

This is a cool idea. Though it would make heroes like Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat stronger there, as they could set up traps to earn them points from anywhere on the map.

Also, how would the points be dished out. Like, the heat you get from a kill gives you points. So a max of 100 points per kill, first to 2000?

or would it be based on the actual health you took out from someone.

"Let me preface this discussion with this. This discussion is based purely on a mechanical and game play context... Hanzo's pick rate or role in the current meta are irrelevant for this thread thank you.


Scatter arrow was clearly intended to be an Area of effect ability to deal moderate damage to multiple targets but unfortunately it has been abused to be an absurd one shot kill mechanism effectively becoming a ranged super shotgun on a mid range archer hero. What are the issues with this?

1) It dissuades heroes that should be countering hanzo to play effectively at their intended purpose. Nothing worse then seeing a flanker who should be wrecking a hanzo hanging too far back get one shot.

2) Its completely counter intuitive to basic fps design. Imagine your new to overwatch you haven't read any guides or how to play videos etc its your first game. You pick hanzo because his aesthetic and concept appeal to you and someone watching you play says ""Hey cool your playing hanzo. Wanna know how to one shot people?"" Immediately you reply ""Yea hit in em in the head"" and this stranger laughs and says ""no.. shoot the ground in front of them."" Wait what? I should intentionally miss to instantly kill someone?

3) Hanzo is a defense hero but not quite a sniper (missing proper magnification) so he needs better area denial. Just being a person in an area with potentially powerful single shots does not make you a defense hero. The one thing that makes Hanzo feel like a sniper is that the damage drop off is non existent and that given proper accuracy he can one hit kill a majority of the roster.

So I propose the following ideas for a rework that will make scatter arrow reflect its intended purpose and solve the 3 issues above.

1) Scatter arrow now can only hit a single hero with a maximum amount of projectiles.

2) Scatter arrows cool down is slightly reduced for each unique target hit by scatter arrow. (turrets and mines included)

3) Scatter arrow now has a slight homing effect within a radius of its impact to facilitate hitting multiple people in open spaces.

4) Adjust the cooldown timer/damage of projectiles to compensate for said change. Scatter arrow should still produce more damage to a single target if potential AOE opportunities do not present themselves often enough but only with proper accurate shots. If you miss the shot you don't one shot a player because luck.

So these changes will accomplish the following:

1) No more ridiculously deflating one shots by your opponent missing with an ability fixing the unintuitive design via poor game mechanics.

2) A chance to reward players who use the ability for its intended purpose and a buff to hanzo's area denial and aoe damage more reflecting his role of a defense hero.",12/19/2017 11:30 AM,"{""id"":""207590282591"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""184500163664"",""name"":""Minerva""}}",post-1,2389 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Minerva-1533,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008C3.png,The rework scatter arrow needs,1000
"Time to make him a viable at least in a slightest. Why junkrat gets so much love and hanzo keeps being crap for years. We need to make his regular bodyshots do like 200 damage. It's projectile hero and his projectile is non-aoe. You can never hit heads reliably on a moving target. So his sniping just makes no sense. But if we do his regular shots kill, we can also rework his scatter arrow that people still complain about. Think about it, what's the reason to pick hanzo over a pharah right now, her rockets hit splash, and she's hard to hit herself. Any hitscan is better than hanzo, because is so much easier to aim and hit on a hitscan reliably. Snipers are underpowered in this game. Why in cs sniper is viable? Because he doesn't need to hit pixel headshot, he just needs to hit his target once. Still team usually has only single awp with max of 2 sometimes.

Many already have for a long time. Or something quite similar if not better.
You will not make it fair this way. You can either give hanzo mobility, give his arrows splash damage or hitscan lol.

"ATTENTION THIS IS LONG AND DETAILED POST ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH SMURF ACCOUNTS IN COMPETITIVE], If you don't like reading long posts, then maybe this isn't for you, the whole point of this post is to shed light on this ongoing problem in competitive overwatch]

Now before I speak on this matter, this post is not calling out people who actually try to win on their smurfs, this post is about calling out the people who carelessly throw on their smurf accounts whenever they please.

Why is smurfing a problem? What's wrong with Smurfing? Questions like these may pop up in your mind as you are reading this post.

I'll tell you why smurfing is a problem, because people feel like they can throw away games on a smurf whenever they please, because it's not their main account or it's one of many smurf accounts they own.

This creates an unbalance of competitive games and sr, this also creates a ripple effect that in turn tilts people the next match, especially people who continuously try their luck again and again hoping that they don't have another thrower, toxic person on their team, or just a loss in general the next match.

This kinda explains why people throw so much (aside from just being a disruptive player) in competitive mode.

The reason I say kinda, because I know this isn't the whole issue with throwers in competitive.

But I think it's at least half.

Most of the throwers I've encountered are just smurfs for the most part. I'd find this out by looking at their profile and noticing that they are level 30-300 in mid-high diamond and have only played one or two competitive seasons, and only have a couple of hours played for each season. Something along the lines of 3 or 5 hours playtime max. Or sometimes people would just straight up say ""I don't really feel like trying anymore, this is my smurf account so I don't care if we lose"" or something like that.

Now it may be easy to see some holes in my previous statement because of the whole placements thing where you can get placed at mid-high diamond if you do well on them. So let me provide a better example, a level 45 player is a platinum in S4, in S5 they are a Grandmaster but they have fallen to diamond. See what I mean?

Now I know it is possible for some people to just pick up a game and quickly get a grasp of it, but let me tell you when I first started playing Overwatch competitive in Season 3 I was no pro right away, I had to really learn this game in order to get where I am now. But maybe that's just me.

2 things I would like to add to my argument before I wrap this up. I can tell most of the people that smurf end up in somewhere in diamond, because I see so many bronze borders or just pretty much blank borders with little to no development on them. Also this kinds explains why the reporting system feels like it doesn't work most of the time, someone can throw on one account and go do it on another.

In closing this is a complicated subject to discuss, I tried to explain this to the best of my ability and just my experience with throwers in general.

I think this problem can be solved by only allowing one or two Overwatch accounts on a single ip or just a single account, for both PC and Console.

Yes I know on Console it would be a little trickier to do because people can create multiple Playstation acccounts for Overwatch, but I think the reduced toxicity will be worth it in the long run.

Now I ask 2 two things of you, the reader.

Please don't get upset with my statement about only allowing one or two Overwatch accounts on a single ip. Yes I know you bought the game and you feel like you have the right to own as many Overwatch accounts as you want, but do you really need 3 or 5 accounts to play on? Isn't one or two enough?

Also please help me shed some light on this topic, because I feel like if this is brought to the Overwatch Team's Attention this will be a start of getting rid of toxicity over the course of time.",12/19/2017 09:44 AM,"{""id"":""207591183166"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":7,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207509919385"",""name"":""BattleAx""}}",post-1,607 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/BattleAx-11594,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001403.png,Smurfing Has Become A Problem In Overwatch Competitive,1000

"The other day I needed the last game for Master.

I searched for a Ranked match and found one on Hanamura.
Each team had 5 Masters and 1 Diamond (4/5 of those were low level smurfs).

As soon as the Setup time starts, I start getting harassed in voice chat.
""Oh poor Koru, little Diamond... would be so bad if you'd lose your game for Master.""
""Koru is going to carry us, right? I'm damn sure he is.""
And on and on.

I just ignored everybody and thought I would play as I normally would, but I got tilted and couldn't concentrate.

So my team mates switch from a Dive comp, to Mei, Torb (building turrets in spawn), Hanzo and Widow, no healer and were laughing so hard as they purposefully threw the match just to leave me in Diamond.

Jokes on them, I eventually got Master anyway after two games, but damn I felt so frustrated and powerless that match, and seeing all that toxicity, I honestly thought at some point that Diamond in the end wasn't so bad.",12/19/2017 11:02 AM,"{""id"":""207591681752"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207454281874"",""name"":""ƘǾRU""}}",post-5,73 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/%C6%98%C7%BERU-2527,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001401.png,Smurfing Has Become A Problem In Overwatch Competitive,1000

Not true. I think there should be some balance of power when playing a hero that doesn't require aim. Currently you can jump in as Junkrat and do really well with very little practice. Same with Mercy, Symetra, and Moira (sp). You can do really well without once having to worry about whether or not you're actually looking at the target. (hyperbole again, relax!)

"Lawbreakers says hello.. at least it would, if it hit the wall as hard as it did. It's a huge example of ""hardcore shooting, no gimmickry here"" completely flopping.

Face the facts, OW has a lot going on for good and/or ill,but it bridged the gap by allowing hitscan aim-intensive heroes, with other characters relying on positioning or negligence from the enemy to thrive.

If aiming with a mouse is the paramount of skill, then outplay those ""no-aim"" types. Don't cry about the kits being ""too good"", stomp those chumps. Or demand nerfs instead of outskilling your opponent.

Remember when you actually had to play skilled heroes like Tracer, Widow, McCree and Soldier to be rewarded?
No, because Tanks and Healers always existed in this game, and you didn't need to be an MLG Hitscan Pro to play any of them. A few DPS classes who don't fit your idea of ""skilled"" slipping into the meta doesn't change the fact that there have been hundreds of players in high ranks who wouldn't pass your ""skill check"" either, and they've been there since launch; they've just been shielding you and healing you.

If you wanted a game to be ENTIRELY about mechanical skill, Overwatch has literally n.e.v.e.r. been the game for you, period.",12/19/2017 05:00 AM,"{""id"":""207590382881"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207418898522"",""name"":""Result""}}",post-17,3995 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Result-11444,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000159C.png,Is Blizz trying to make OW a low skill game?,1000

"I'm on the fence with this one. I get that this is an FPS hybrid and so it's not all about aim, and for that reason I totally respect players who use characters that need to utilise positioning and game sense more than tracking, like Sym or Winston. Got no problem whatsoever with those characters and their primary fire.

I do have a slight worry though, I don't like spam at all. Something about it just irritates me, it almost feels like you are just punting, even if it's a calculated punt it's still hoping to get lucky, and I just don't like that or think it should be rewarded. Junkrat is obviously the epitome of this but I also find myself getting a bit tilted by Moira's damage orbs sometimes, just feels very chancy and irritating to die to (play as Tracer so the orbs can be a real nuisance when thrown down a choke). I'm actually trying to change my mindset though, because thinking this way makes me tilt and play worse.

"1. Play Moira.

2. Attack any ""invincibly-placed"" object with a damage orb (Translocator, Biotic Field, Barriers or Shields, even another Biotic Orb, and Ice Wall of both friendlies and enemies).

3. Watch how it will try to attack those items and slow down instead of ignoring them like last time. This minor stealth nerf impairs the very purpose of the orb - damaging enemies. This means that if there is a reinhardt on the enemy team (or even your team) and an orb is thrown, all that will need to be done is put up a shield to completely burn it out with little damage to enemy team mates. The same goes with Mei's ice wall, both friendly and enemy objects will burn out the orb.

The problem is that since the orb prioritizes barriers and objects over players now, all the enemy has to do is place any one of these objects down to completely negate the damage orb affects.

So just something that has been catching steam as of late. Thoughts? A good nerfing? Bad nerfing? Will this bug change your gameplay of the hero? Post in the comments below!

She has had bug after bug on the PTR, but people still think these changes are intended? Doubt this was intended in any way.

It's kind of ironic that Blizzard's most balanced launch hero has also been one of their buggiest. We get the best and worst of Blizzard game design wrapped up in one hero.

"First time posting anything about bugs or the like.

Personally a little conflicted. When Moira First came out i got excited seeing a hero who could trivally disarm Symmetra's turret (Sym is actually one of my mains). When she was released and i found out I couldn't do that it made me a bit sad.

This also was strange to me when i realized my ""Evil hand"" on Moira wasn't able to target Torb's Turret and i ended up died before I realized.

So these most recent changes addressed those two issues. What came off to me as a bit of a downside was seeing how this most recent change impacted the biotic orb though especially with shield tanks. Rein, Winston & Orisa have become measurably much harder to fight since the change/bug came into play.

Additionally those same heroes also make it much more difficult to use the biotic orb to try and hurt the intended prey of Moira low HP targets like mercy, Lucio, Ana, Tracer, Genji, Hanzo ect. who are fairly known for hiding behind those barriers becasue i might get lucky and with a well placed shot I see the orb only do 50 damage despite the whole thing bouncing into a room.

I feel Moira is a VERY enjoyable hero and i personally love her I really hope that this auto lock on undesirable targets is fixed but I could almost see Blizzard keeping the changes but it really will pull a lot of my love of the hero as she felt about perfect till this change.

if having her orb not interact with turrets is acceptable I'd prefer to revert to that change than have the orb get mitigated by shields and items because it just incentives her healing orb instead which is already very strong int he first place.

This change hasn't stopped me from playing Moira in comp atm but it means Biotic orb isn't used unless I am a 1v1 or no shield scenario and I might be able to finish off my foes.

I think if blizzard was to make these changes official then I would still play her for sure but would like to ask the biotic orb replenish her healing meter slightly to offset the mitigation/ effectiveness drop off.

Either way i'm very interested to see what they do with this as Moira has been my main this season so far and I don't plan to stop till I see a reason to.",12/19/2017 11:09 AM,"{""id"":""207591581639"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""186147217594"",""name"":""Zombiebait""}}",post-23,9 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Zombiebait-1679,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C7F.png,Steath Nerfing of Moira Breaks Biotic Orbs,1000

You didn't deserve this tragic end.

I've talked many bad things about you when you killed me many times, but a few months ago I discovered a true reality behind your character. You were lonely and your lack of power made people not playing as you, and I wanted to give you some love by trying to play as you, or helping a friendly Symmetra. Not a Symmetra main, but I tried to support them.

I've loved each skin you had.
A very beautiful woman.
The Vishkar Indian Princess.

But the last patch came.
Now you die very easily. Your counters counter you more than ever, your turrets are more weak than ever, and your teleporter and shield gens are more killable than ever.

Blizzard never adressed you. You just passed away.

My heart goes to Vishkar Corporation and all Symmetra mains who fought for a perfect society, by protecting people with their armor shields, and shortening distances using teleporters.

The game creators just let her die.

"1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.
sombra translocator is really clunky because if you put it in a bad place, you have to wait 19 seconds until you can place a new one, or you're forced to tp to it for a new one, which is very frustrating when playing sombra. letting her cancel translocator will make her feel much more smooth.
bonus: unlocks a new distraction strat for sombra- throwing at enemies trans to distract them while your team sets up, and sombra can cancel it and get it after 1 second. before, the strat wasn't good because you had to wait for a full 19 sec to use it again.

2. 20 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

3. damage threshold for cancelling stealth and hack- 20 damage. while stealth and hack should be cancellable by damage, every little point of damage cancels it currently, even one point of damage from a random d.va bullet 100 meters away.
giving it a threshold will require enemies to be in their effective range in order to cancel it.

4. reduce the delay of entering stealth to 0.15 seconds. while I do understand the delay of exiting stealth, there shouldn't be a delay for entering stealth. the delay of entering stealth makes the ability too situational- you can only use stealth while you're hidden from the enemy- you need to be stealthy in order to use a stealth ability, which sounds strange to me. every other stealth ability in any other game is instant, even moira's fade is instant, only sombra requires a delay, which is kind of annoying.

5. translocator travel speed increased by 25%. the current travel speed is a bit too slow. making it faster will make her feel better to play.

6. hacked players now have a big sugar skull above them that displays the duration of the hack, while making the hacks more visible.
hacked enemies now have purple particle effects around them, while teammates have red around them (for some reason it's the opposite on live). hacked enemies will be way more visible now.

7. movement speed increased to 6 meters per second instead of the standard 5.5. this will put her a bit more in line with the other flankers (genji and tracer).
part of the problem with sombra's fighting is that she has no in-fight mobility to close distances, like genji and tracer can. while she's not supposed to be a full on flanker dps, this will make her better at fighting.

8. spread reduced by 5%- sombra's spread is too large currently, but any higher decrease in spread will focus her too much on killing, while she is a dps hero, people forget that part of her gameplay is a calculated tactician, that has advanced strats and is hard to play, she's not supposed to pop behing the enemy and murder them all, that's not the intention that blizzard has for her, and I agree on that part.

feels short because you place it 9000 meters away from enemies making it impossible for the majority of the cast to counter it.

1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.
sombra translocator is really clunky because if you put it in a bad place, you have to wait 19 seconds until you can place a new one, or you're forced to tp to it for a new one, which is very frustrating when playing sombra. letting her cancel translocator will make her feel much more smooth.
bonus: unlocks a new distraction strat for sombra- throwing at enemies trans to distract them while your team sets up, and sombra can cancel it and get it after 1 second. before, the strat wasn't good because you had to wait for a full 19 sec to use it again.

2. 25 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

3. damage threshold for cancelling stealth and hack- 20 damage. while stealth and hack should be cancellable by damage, every little point of damage cancels it currently, even one point of damage from a random d.va bullet 100 meters away.
giving it a threshold will require enemies to be in their effective range in order to cancel it.

4. reduce the delay of entering stealth to 0.15 seconds. while I do understand the delay of exiting stealth, there shouldn't be a delay for entering stealth. the delay of entering stealth makes the ability too situational- you can only use stealth while you're hidden from the enemy- you need to be stealthy in order to use a stealth ability, which sounds strange to me. every other stealth ability in any other game is instant, even moira's fade is instant, only sombra requires a delay, which is kind of annoying.

5. translocator travel speed increased by 25%. the current travel speed is a bit too slow. making it faster will make her feel better to play.

6. hacked players now have a big sugar skull above them that displays the duration of the hack, while making the hacks more visible.
hacked enemies now have purple particle effects around them, while teammates have red around them (for some reason it's the opposite on live). hacked enemies will be way more visible now.

7. movement speed increased to 6 meters per second instead of the standard 5.5. this will put her a bit more in line with the other flankers (genji and tracer).
part of the problem with sombra's fighting is that she has no in-fight mobility to close distances, like genji and tracer can. while she's not supposed to be a full on flanker dps, this will make her better at fighting.

8. spread reduced by 5%- sombra's spread is too large currently, but any higher decrease in spread will focus her too much on killing, while she is a dps hero, people forget that part of her gameplay is a calculated tactician, that has advanced strats and is hard to play, she's not supposed to pop behing the enemy and murder them all, that's not the intention that blizzard has for her, and I agree on that part.

If anybody noticed it, those changes focus around making sombra less clunky, which is the major problem with her currently.
hopefully sombra gets some of these changes in the future, she does need some attention from the devs...


So you want to be rewarded for messing up your trans? in that case i guess i want widow grapple to reset if i dont like where it latches on to :D
Thats not my intention... currently any other escape ability is instant, doesn't require any setup, and available all the time (except cd, sombra has a cd too).
sombra's trans is not like this though, it requires setup, if you didn't set it up it's far from instant, and when set up, it has a limited time that it can be used. If you didn't notice, no other mobility or escape ability has that much downsides, while trans is technically one of the best escapes, the limits on it are too harsh.",12/18/2017 03:42 PM,"{""id"":""207590182245"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-9,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.

means characters that wait for you to translocate can no longer counter you and makes junkrat's trap useless

2. 25 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

feels short because you place it 9000 meters away from enemies making it impossible for the majority of the cast to counter it. The balancing factor to this is that you have a very short window to do work. Your buff removes this balance.
sombra can't know if someone actually found her translocator, unless she was near it when the enemy was there, then obviously she isn't going to tp to it anyway. you are wrong about the trap though, this is not the only use it has, it's one of the way more minor ones, junkrat's main priority should not be searching for her trans to place a trap on it. and will you say it isn't fair that it disappears after a short duration, making the junkrat trap placed there useless?
your arguments counter eachother... about the trans duration I already answered about it to someone else.
If you're placing the trans 9000 meters away from the fight, you're doing it wrong. sombra needs to be very active in order to be effective, she cannot afford placing it so far away, so she places it closer to her team, and mind you, flanking exists. also, sombra is a flanker, she plays behind the enemy team, not behind her team, she cannot appear with stealth 10 meters away from the enemy and hack them easily, she uses high ground and hidden places to hack people, and if her translocator is behind her team, she has a hard time getting there in almost all maps unless she runs through the stairs for a bunch of time after waisting a ton more time to get from 9000 meters away (like you said), and until she hacks someone her trans is down, even with the increased duration. I don't know how you play her, but that's not a proper sombra play, maybe that's why a lot of people think sombra is complete F tier...",12/18/2017 03:54 PM,"{""id"":""207590681686"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-10,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

"As a Sombra main I really like the things in your opening post. It is more or less exactly hwo I feel too.
While I can understand the intentions and situations behind it, I'm not so sure if a spread decrease or the option to cancel the translocator is really needed.

What I would really like to see for Christmas is
5 translocator travel speed - always feels hilarious when you see how good old Ana can throw a nade and then compare it to how our young mexican friend is throwing the translocator

6 Better visual effects for hacked enemies!!!! MUST HAVE since release!!!!!

7 Speed buff - makes totally sense that she gets the same speed like the other flankers. It fits the character, the lore and cinematic, the playstyle, ...

"You can remedy most of what you're asking for just through practice.

1. Failing a translocator is simply down to the player. Essentially this buff is dumbing down a skillful component of your kit.

2. 15 seconds is more than enough time to get a lot done. This simply depends on where you're leaving your translocator and what your positioning is like.

3. Again dependent on positioning. Make sure to assess the situation before hacking/stealthing.

4. Can be completely mitigated through the throw,stealth,teleport combo. Arguably one of the most important things to know as a Sombra player.

5,6 and 7. Sure decent buffs.

1. if someone failed a trans, he's just going to teleport to it again and wait for the cd again. this is on of sombra's clunkiness, the cd waiting, no other character in the game has downtime because their abilities are on cd. this is to help solve the issue. if the enemy found the trans and sombra saw it she is obviously not going to tp to it, she is just going to have more cd waiting.
+if the enemy sits there for 15s to wait for sombra to trans, it's bad play, unless she has emp, but even then, the long downtime for the possibility sombra will translocate is not good. this change will go against those strategies, so players won't do stupid stuff.
2. 15 sec is nice, but as I said- the limits on trans are too harsh, 5 seconds more will not hurt her. she needs her handicaps lowered...
3. yes it depends on positioning, I know how to do it, but when you flank and a d.va shoots you 50 meters away when she comes out of spawn and cancels your hack isn't fair, the change still lets enemies cancel it with damage, but more fair for sombra. as I said, lower her handicaps
4. yes it's a combo, but trans isn't available most of the time, especially if you don't want the ability to cancel it, and when you have it you can't always waste it like that, you need it to get to high ground.
8. I can actually aim with her pretty well (after a year of practice with her...), but her spread is too large, requiering you to be too close to an enemy in order to shoot them, 5% decrease is very slight anyway, she'll still have large spread, it will just reward good aim more.",12/19/2017 10:19 AM,"{""id"":""207591183188"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-15,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

"Hi guys.

As you can tell by my stats, my skill level is very low at the moment but I want to improve.

Overwatch is my first fps game and at first I really didn't care much about being good because I tend to play videogames sporadically when I have nothing else to do and I always end up getting bored of them quickly. This wasn't the case this time and I ended up liking it a lot and therefore, playing a lot more than I had expected, but thanks to this I developed some bad habits.

Recently some friends of mine decided to buy the pc version of the game so we could play together as a team. They're quite good players with years of experience on other fps games and I don't want to be carried by them, I want to be useful and help them win, but my lack of mechanical skill and game knowledge prevents me from doing that.

Right now I'm focusing on exploring the maps to understand how to defend/attack each one of them in a more efficient way, where to place turrets and what spots I can reach with mobility abilites to make the best use of them whenever I can. I'm also trying out heros I usually don't play to learn what their strengths and weaknesses are so I can be more flexible and to counter enemies more easily in the future (It may not seem like a lot, but I think baby steps are better than nothing.)

I'll start working on my aim once my first gaming mouse arrives because I don't want to mess with the game settings now only to change them again in a few weeks when I have it.

So... is there any tips you can give to someone who has never touched another fps game before? Thank you in advance.

Yah, I like triple DPS if there's 2 supports and 1 tank. I usually play Zen here because the best defense is offense with this kind of comp. Discord really helps a lot with the murdering, and he can help sustain someone who's a bit too far for the main healer to get to. That's only if there's a shield tank though, otherwise it's a bit dicey to pick Zen.

It is the pro's jobs to do exactly that though, they should be hitting every headshot that is humanly possible... I am just saying in this case Hanzo's max potential should theoretically be higher than Widow's or any other hero in fact.

"Hanzo effective range though is far shorter than Widow's because no matter how mechanically good you are, a delayed hit will fail a lot because of the enemies movements from the time you rleased the arrow to the time it reaches the target.

Hanzo is also far less self reliant in terms of getting away from dire situations (even less than Widow) and in a game where Tracer and Genji exist you are most likely dieing to them than killing any1.

Because it is impossible. Projectiles are unreliable in nature. Being a god of projectiles is to have 40% accuracy and 8-10% critical hits. Widow is capable of reliably killing any target in the line of sight without the possibility of a counterplay except shields and DM.

wallclimb as a passive

Hook is objectively better. Wallclimb allows you to reach interesting positions, but its capabilities are noticeably lower. Hanzo can not do trickshots with the help of wallclimb, cannot quickly change his position, can not avoid two dive tanks at once with little help from healers. With this, you could argue when the hook had 12s cd, but after the buff, this ability is absolutely superior to anything Hanzo has to offer.

The difference between Widow and Hanzo is that Widows potential is achievable, and Hanzo will always be a super risky choice.

Not only that, but we will restore full HP always by using recall, just analogously to how they removed the ability to self-damage yourself with our ""culprit hero"" in a previous patch. If we had any armor in the last 3 seconds, we will restore that as well to the maximum value we had at any point in those 3 seconds. This should enable some new strategies and allow for more diverse team compositions. Besides, Tracer and Torbjorn are friends. Didn't you read the comic?

- Tracer's bomb now has 30% larger detonation radius. Nobody asked for this, but her ultimate feels kinda weak and is easy to destroy, so a buff is in order.

While we're at it, let me buff Genji a little as well (2 buffs for him):

- Genji now has 2 dashes. Getting a kill will reset 1 dash, This gives him immediate unconditional 100 burst damage, but after all, he needs this buff, he isn't even the best DPS.

- his Dragonblade hitbox is now 30% longer. Just so that you can make sure to kill that annoying flying Mercy and have finally a true counter to Valkyrie.

it takes 12 Junkrat direct hits to get RIP tire.

"It seems to me that a lot of people have a big misconception about sombra, I'll cover some of them and why they are wrong.

1. sombra isn't a support
this is a half misconception about her, while she isn't a support, she is a dps with strong utility, but people seem to forget the part that says utility.
you can compare her to zen, in a way. both can deal high damage, have utility that is weak healing and very strong debuffs to enemies. both their ults are supportive, zen's is making his team invulnerable (to some extent), sombra does the opposite- she makes the enemy team very vulnerable.
there are 2 groups of sombra players: one that says that she is dps, the other says she is a support.
both of the groups need to understand that she is a hybrid, but leaning a bit towards dps, though still has strong utility.

2. sombra needs buffs to her dps
as a fact, she doesn't. she already does 160 dps, she doesn't need any sort of increase, the only thing she needs is a 5% reduction on spread.
It seems that people are trying to turn sombra into an easy no-brain tracer, instead of managing blinks, thay want to pop out of stealth instantly, and be able to slaughter everybody easily.
this is not blizzard's intention, and I agree on that part.
Sombra is built to have complex and advanced uses of stealth, hack and translocator, not being another but easier tracer.
if somebody wants to delve into the real potential of sombra, search in youtube fitzyishere, watch his guides and gameplay on youtube and twitch, you'll see what sombra is really capable of- far more than just killing.

3. blind pro following
this is not really a misconception about sombra, but part of the reason there is a misconception.
while pro following is good and helps your gameplay, there is also blind following, which is bad.
what is it? people doing what the pros do, without realising why they do it, or not understanding the balance of characters, their weaknesses and strengths, and their counters, just doing what they say.
heroes that they play should be the only ones who are played.
heroes are op? slap them with a nerf, doesn't really matter what is op about them.
heroes aren't used by the pros? buff them without realising what is weak about them, just give them some sort of a buff.
example: the pros say that junkrat is op (he is, to some extent. reducing his ult charge rate will balance him more). a blind folllower, that doesn't realise what makes him op, what are his strengths and weaknesses, will just pick him up, and play him because the pros say he's op, so it'll be an easy win, right?
no. the player will keep running junkrat against a pharah, that player who plays against him, does understand that pharah is a massive counter to him, and will feed over the fact that junkrat doesn't realise it, and will not switch.

that is part of the effect of not realising what is wrong with sombra.
she's an offense hero and the pros don't use her as a dps? buff her damage! (don't!)
this also affects sym, people don't realise what she can do, so they flame sym players for playing her, as they themselves, have no idea of how to use her, as the pros don't use her.
this is a problem, people have no idea about the balance of a hero, but they still try to do balance changes.

so as I said, damage is not the actual problem with sombra, the problems of sombra are:
1. she feels clunky to use, and her handicaps are too harsh, preventing her from doing her role effectively.
I made a thread regarding that problem
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760746368#post-1
2. how sombra is used as a support.
first, I want to say that there is no problem with sombra being used as a support in the pro scene. the utility part of her kit is the more complex part, and pros can utilitize it perfectly.
the problem is about how she is being used as a support, it's just farming healthpacks. while hacked healthpacks are part of her kit, I think that hacking enemies should be the main focus of her utility.
so the problem is: hacking enemies is often unrewarding. there are two changes that can change that, but you can't add them both, it'll make sombra too powerful.
1. when a hacked enemy is killed, the hack cd is reset-
this puts a big highlight on the part of rewarding good sombra play, but there are two problems with this change:
-it only buffs one of the hack uses: hacking to make an enemy vulnerable.
there are other uses to hack- denying the use of an ult at the right time, hacking enemies to see if they have ult and inform your team, cancelling a channel ability.
buffing only one of the uses has the possibilty of making the other uses useless. why hack an enemy if you can't get the reset for it? it will make the other uses worthless.
-it can become very op, being able to hack a bunch of enemies without emp has the possibility of becoming too powerful

2. when a player is hacked- the cd timers stop and he can't charge his ult, resource meters don't charge automaticaly, but moira can still charge it with attacking, genji can still get resets on dash while hacked.
this is actually a very good change for sombra: it makes all uses more powerful, it even adds another use for hacking- hacking to delay cooldowns.
this is a change that will add counters to the meta, reducing junkrat mine spam, stoping tracer from getting blinks, reduces orisa barrier spam, and much more.
this also solves another problem with hack: sometimes hack is useless because the cds of the enemy are longer than the hack duration anyway, now it will stop the cds.

to sum this up: sombra is a dps-utility hero, with complex uses to her abilities,
though what she is currently lacking isn't damage.
blizzard designed her as a weaker dps hero but with utility, she was never meant to be a full dps easy flanker hero.
her handicaps are too harsh and she feels too clunky to use, while hacking enemies is often unrewarding.
hopefully some of the changes I suggested will be added, or some other ones because sombra is currently lacking...",12/19/2017 09:42 AM,"{""id"":""207591782592"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-1,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,HUGE misconceptions about sombra in the community,1001

This changed in the past couple of days.

Take Temple of Anubis (left room) as one of many examples, one Orb and the whole room is cleared.

Hey, everyone.

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.

We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).

We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.

Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.

Your teammates can respectfully provide their opinion and suggest using a different hero for the gameplay situation that your team is experiencing, but the final decision about which hero you want to play with is yours alone.

We built Overwatch around the concept of teamwork, and we believe the game is much more fun for everyone in a match when we’re picking heroes that contribute to the overall success of the team. At times, this means we’ll be playing our mains; other times, we should be trying to help the team by choosing heroes that round out the team’s composition. We won’t be actioning you if you only play your main, but we also don’t believe this is the ideal way to play Overwatch—especially in competitive settings.


Finally. Blizzard has finally addressed the one-trick problem. TL;DR Blizzard is saying that one-tricking is not a bannable offense, reporting someone for one-tricking is, and while the game is should be played with people swapping to round out the team, trying your best with the hero you choose is all that anyone can ask of you.

Hey, everyone.

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.

We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).

We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.

Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.

Nobody expected a response that would state that one tricking should be banned really. People just needed (and still need) explanation on the definition of ""throwing"" and what is bannable.

There are tens of situations I can give as an example with the question:""But is this not practically throwing/feeding/griefing?"" Coz nobody knows what is bannable. Yes one tricking is not bannable (that is clear) but a countered or feeding one trick that is trying his best, does that fall under that category?

Nobody finds just that a player should be banned for playing a certain hero. The problems start when they are being outplayed. I wouldnt know the answer to that either.

If your team has to change comp because the enemy is destroying and you cant because you are an OTP that wont change 100% of the time you are basically refusing to work with your team for no absolute reason besides ""i dont want to and i dont care"".

"Ana and Hanzo, buff them!

Ana and Hanzo are meant to be high-skill heroes, performing the best at high ranks and the worse at low ranks due to their high mechanical skill requirement and game awareness BUT THEY DON'T!

Ana and Hanzo actually perform worse comparatively at higher ranks. In bronze Ana has the 4th lowest winrate and Hanzo the 3rd, in GM Ana has the lowest winrate in the game and Hanzo has the 2nd.

This is a massive problem, it's not just the fact that they never have a positive winrate across all tiers of play but the fact that mastering said hero is not letting people climb.

Heroes that have high-skill ceiling's should naturally perform best at GM but if there is not enough value in their kits to justify mastering them to this extent it all becomes pointless.

Ana is one of our precious healers, she should be a lot more viable than she currently is at higher-ranks, Hanzo is precious in his own way.

The difference between Ana and most of the other healers is that she has to put way more actions per minute to have the same impact on the team as the rest of the healers (with the exception of possibly Lucio).

Ana is the third or fourth highest heals per minute healer in the game. Mercy and Moira can outheal Ana easily, while Zenyatta is often outhealed by Ana. Lucio, however, is a toss up. Depending on the comp and the map, Lucio can heal more than Ana. Not only this, Ana is the only hero that has to be near pin-point accurate to be an effective healer. So if the Ana on the team isn't the greatest of shooters, her effectiveness drops drastically.

When it comes to survivability, Ana is the second to last. Lucio has his speedboost, Moria has her fade and Mercy has her ridiculous health regeneration as well as Guardian Angel. Yes, Ana has her Sleep Dart, but considered how hard it is to land, I'd say the only healer with a worse survivability is Zenyatta.

Aside from healing, only Lucio has less of an effect on the enemy team than Ana. Mercy has her damage boost, Zenyatta has the discord orb and Moira has the damage orbs as well as a 15m range damage semi-lock-on attack. Again, Ana has to be pin-point accurate to have any effect to the enemy team. Being countered by Dive? She's countered by any shield. Whether it's D.Va or Winston diving or just Reinhardt or Orisa standing in the choke, she's rather helpless. The biggest effect Ana can have on the enemy team, however, is her Bio-Nade. Landing a big Bio-Nade can be the deciding factor in a team fight, but consider what the opportunity costs are. Zenyatta doesn't lose anything by having his discord orb up, Mercy loses on healing but can quickly switch back and Moira actually gains healing charge by using her damage orbs. Ana loses out on her only means of self-healing, she puts herself in a big disadvantage against flankers and loses on a large amount of potential healing.

So when you're saying buffing Ana makes her too powerful of a support, especially in the wake of the current Mercy meta, I don't know what you're talking about.

Zen has 150 shield that auto regens when he doesn't take damage, he has the ability to discord players and track their movements further increasing his survivability. He also has an ult that fully heals him and makes him invincible for a few secs allowing him to contest the objective or save his team from a barrage of ults, whereas ana can only stop 1 ult if she lands sleep dart and we all know how much skill is required for that.

So when Blizz said they couldn't add a PTR on console I just believed them and moved on. Then Fortnite BR came around and they became my new golden standard for patching games. They recently said they were going to test out their new aiming mechanics on PTR but then they changed their mind and decided to make it an extra game mode so console could participate. So I ask why Blizzard never put the PTR in the arcade so console players could actually not be left out in everything. Also there's no FOV slider on console and that's a problem.,12/18/2017 05:20 PM,"{""id"":""207590582098"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207458374879"",""name"":""SladesSpades""}}",post-1,31 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/SLADES%20SPADES,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001645.png,PTR on console solution,1001

Junkrat has two mines that do damage.

I love how you use this as an example, then complain when others use the same example for other characters in a fair way. ""Give everyone two of everything and its all fair""
But other than that-

We all know the translocator doesn't do any damage, and is there for mobility and confusion for the other team.
But giving Sombra two would just be confusing.
She would basically be an invisible Tracer. The idea might sound fun to play as for a little bit but eventually, she will become most likely become hated enough to be called for deletion by the fandom.
If you really want to buff Sombra I would say to listen to the person earlier

The fastest I could see it working is after you throw both you always go back to the 1st one placed such that; Button Press Tele 1 set---> Button Press Tele 2 set -----> Button Press return to Tele 1 ------> Button Press Set Tele 1 if off CD OR go to Tele 2 if on CD.

"Rather than two translocators, she should be able to cancel her translocator.

Sometimes you see it being camped, or you realize its not going to work, or you throw it wrong, or you need to get the high ground but it's already down, etc and are faced with two options. Option A is to translocate to the bad spot and start her entire process all over again, or Option B just accept you can't translocate and go about your business with an ability that is effectively one of the longest cooldowns in the entire game. It is clunky and time consuming on a kit that is already hampered by numerous other issues.

Having two translocators would fix that problem. But it would also be a bit broken because her translocator when working correctly is already one of the best movement abilities in the game. It would allow her to do broken stuff like invisible-toss-translocate behind an enemy team, EMP, and then immediately translocate out. That is stupid overpowered.

"I am begging the devs to read this..please..we desparately need a Mei rework...
Mei was my very first main and she holds a special place in my heart. I even had my first battletag called Mei because I loved her so much. Back then was dark times though, with literally every other game someone commenting how I'm satan or how they hate mei, etc. I stuck with her though, even though her kit was lackluster. Bullying got so bad though that I eventually did write in to support and they gave me a free battletag change, they were really nice. I stopped playing Mei after that...

Now it's almost 2018 and Mei is still in her exact same state at the game's launch..She is not the best at anything other than walling off a small choke after one person comes in..She's not even average at anything else..literally anyone else is a better pick over her and can do more. Need to snipe people? Pick widow or hanzo (mei's icicle has horrid falloff and is the hardest to land on people due to having two separate waiting periods) Need pure damage? literally anyone in DPS category is better. Need to contest the point during overtime? Tracer is universally better and can actually kill people consistently. All mei can do is iceblock for 4 seconds then get instantaneously focused by all 6 ppl when she pops out.

Her kit is really in need of revamping. Not tweaking numbers, but remaking or replacing skills entirely. All heroes need a reliable and consistent method of damage output. Mei does not have this. She has to rely on securing solo 1v1 kills with her freeze+icicle combo on squishies to be of any use to the team damage/kill-wise. Do not even think about using icicles for a whole game, they are the hardest projectile to land in the game. I have nearly 80 hours on her and still miss 80% of my icicles, they're just too inconsistent with a chargeup period that can't be held like hanzo's arrows but fire instantly after charging, air-travel period, and falloff damage.

Her ultimate can be escaped by 75% of the cast extremely easily, meanwhile zarya's grav just got buffed to prevent this, so why doesn't mei's joke of an ult get the same treatment?

After all this, she still has bugs that are unaddressed. Literally yesterday I played her and had hope that 'Ill do good with her, I will actually get some gold medals this time!', and got that silly hope in my heart like I do from time to time that she will actually be good in a fight, and we were pushing the final objective and I was lined up to save the day with a blizzard and threw my blizzard towards the point and.........
it disappeared. It literally disappeared into another void. There were no pitfalls in this level and even myself and another person on enemy team both stopped and was like 'wtf whered it go?' in match chat. If youre determined to make mei keep her mediocre and broken kit, at least fix the bugs so it functions like it says.

This is my final plea for Mei's life, Blizzard. She is an amazing character and I love Mei-Ling Zhou, but something's gotta change to her kit, I can pick literally anyone else and do more for my team quite easily.

Well, I've experienced some new (and strange) ways people might be toxic in your games. In fact, it's worse than that: a way that you might look as the toxic one.

Last night, a person decided to pretend to be me on the chat a bit before the game started. How he did it? Well, I suppose he just typed a normal sentence and went for a [Name-of-his-target:] or he just hacked somehow.

The worst part: most people bought his ""prank"" and really thought that I was throwing/trolling the game.

"Let's assume that all heroes are currently balanced. What could a hero stand to lose in order to gain more power in another area and be in a better place overall?

I think Ana's heal block could be reduced in power, maybe reducing healing by 75% instead of totally blocking it, in exchange for a shorter Sleep Dart cooldown. Sleep Dart is her only real means of defending herself, but it's incredibly hard to land and has a lot more uses than just self-defense. Ana is expected to have it in her pocket when she gets jumped on, when the enemy uses an ult she can cancel, to set up kills for her teammates, or save teammates from abilities like Roadhog's hook. Her grenade would still be really powerful, but Ana would be a lot safer.

Or another hero, Symmetra. Reducing the health of her Photon Barrier in order to also reduce its cooldown would help Symmetra out a lot. The barrier is virtually never destroyed by an enemy. 1000 HP is too much to burn through before it hits a wall, so the enemy just lets it drift away. Its primary use is to block line of sight and block burst damage, which a weaker barrier could do just as easily.

She's a 200HP squishy with low DPS, she's not at risk of face tanking anything.

Uninterruptible hack is exactly that and she can actually ""tank"" a fair bit on a health pack.

Thing is, besides it being completely counter to her play-style, hack isn't a solo ability. It may be worse than shooting in a pure 1v1, but it disables those abilities against her entire team, not just Sombra herself.

I really don't understand why you are so focused on this. Yes a headshot is way harder to pull off than a hack. Sombra can stealth behind enemy lines while Widow can't.

She needs her spread decreased, her stealth to be more stealthy and maybe even have her hack time reduced. Something along those lines. But you should still be able to interrupt her hack. She has her ultimate for easy instant hacks already.

You act like we all disagree that Sombra needs help. This is just not the best way to go about it.
Because shooting is already better than Hacking under most circumstances. Improving her SMG therefore makes Hack worse again and risks making it even more redundant. Hack is where she needs improving.

tip1: not everyone enjoys playing DPS and I had games where I had to fill as DPS before (normally these games start to happen from Masters onwards)

Many people enjoy Mercys playstyle, many don't. That's just the reality of it.

Step 1: go into competitive
Step 2: be the last to pick
Step 3: take a look at what's missing. Maybe a teammate will even be kind enough to suggest it

I'm just nitpicking but sadly, if you play to win, the ""27 unique heroes"" becomes ""5 or 6, but usually Mercy if you fill""

"Let me start off by saying I believe both these heroes definitely need some kind of buff as they are 2 of the lowest pick rate heroes in the game at the moment.

Now, for Mei, I honestly don't know what I would do to improve her. She is fun to play in quick play but feels pretty useless in comp (I could be wrong, but I don't have a ton of time on her)

For Sombra, I don't think her spread should be adjusted as mentioned in the post above mine. People argue that her spread should be reduced to do more damage but if you can track your enemy well Sombra actually does a fair amount of damage. Instead, decrease reload time to get that extra bit of damage if you really need it before you translocate out.

I do agree that there should be a sugar skull on hacked enemies to point it out to teammates. I like the idea of a hack threshold but I feel it might be too OP.

I also really like the idea of having her hack reset after confirming an elimination like Genji's dash.",12/19/2017 07:31 AM,"{""id"":""207590382984"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207522397220"",""name"":""MACHINE""}}",post-3,15 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/MACHINE-12531,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001401.png,Mei and Sombra buff idea,1001

"My friend just got silenced for 47 days from multiple reports. Seeing how toxic this game can be getting reports from all sources like when you're losing, hero choice, abusive words, communication or enemy team upset at ya. It comes down to the point why even bother banning when the cycle continues? I've seen my friend get upset when ally teammates starts ridiculing. I gave advice saying just turn off all communication, but then what is the point when you're still going to get reported?

There is no way out of this mess like this game is report frenzy zone no matter how light or strong it is. You'll get ban no matter how much you love or hate it. The reason I play this game less and haven't touched it much as my friend is because of these stuff. This game brings nothing, but the worst out of people and the developer staff promotes instead of trying to solve the problem. I heard bans are done by a automated system which gives a user whether innocent or guilty a hard time to appeal.

I know nothing can do be done about this, but check out the report if it's legit or not. False reports are toxic and seeing how innocent players who can get trigger by a troll's trap means this game promote toxic instead retaliating. Ban those who make the false reports the ones who starts the problem. The ones who play devil's advocate.

I already know my friend isn't innocent and my friend doesn't own a mic sadly. However I don't think even staying quiet won't help much when players just start getting trigger over anything. This is why I play this game less now because of how my friend gets baited easily which leads to report zone act 1, but at the same time still willing to support the team. I don't know why when it's easier to quit.

...She's far and away the most difficult support and yet has the lowest win-rate out of ALL heroes in Grand-master (where she should be excelling) and the second lowest preforming support (Lucio) is 6 ranks up and has an almost 4% higher winrate, I think you can make your own conclusions.

Her damage is still 10 lower than it was, speed boost was completely removed from Nano, her nade was already nerfed once, she has zero self-heal, no mobility or positioning tools, the most meta tanks counter her hard, and again, she takes infinite amounts of skill compared to the other supports.

Why is it so difficult for people to understand how completely removing or invalidating something is a bad design choice?

If you played her you’d know why the anti-heal is fine as it is instead of calling for unreasonable nerfs.

sombra’s hack or emp can completely invalidate some ultimates once they’re started. is that bad game design?
mccree’s flashbang and roadhog’s hook can do the same as well.

zenyatta and lucio’s ults can invalidate soldier and genji’s ultimates on top of others I’m sure. is that bad game design?

dva’s dm can eat all hitscan and projectiles, so she can just straight up delete things from the game. is that bad game design?

It's not absolutely blocking, there actually is counter play (recall, zarya bubbles, shadowstep, etc.)

It's super powerful for sure, but one of the only things that makes Ana playable. If you nerfed this, you'd have to give her very large buffs elsewhere.


50% healing reduction is powerful enough. If you can't kill someone who's being healed by only 50% then I don't know what to tell you.


You have to take it in context with the rest of her kit. It makes a huge difference in 1v1s like hog. 50% takes it from a 1v1 you can sometimes win to one you lose every time. Similar story with the lucio 1v1 (normally in your favor, would now likely be lucio favor), the 76 1v1, and in a bunch of other situations.

She's already at the very edge between playable and leaving the meta. This is a massive nerf which will push her well over that edge. She already struggles to keep up in healing with mercy and moira, her advantage is her utility. If you lessen her utility, there's no reason to play her over moira.

And it does matter that you don't play her. You don't understand her match ups and you don't have a sense for what it's like playing the hero.",12/19/2017 07:32 AM,"{""id"":""207591681659"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207511154047"",""name"":""VPLewboski""}}",post-25,635 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/Cato%20the%20Wise,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008E8.png,Ana's Biotic Grenade healing block,1001

"Can't win the lotto if you don't buy a ticket lol. For real though, probably not working is not throwing. It's grasping as straws, it's desparate, it's a gamble, it's questionable, it's a lot of things, but it's not throwing.

As for the OPs example, if the player picked Sym out of spite/anger because they knew they would suck and it would hurt the game, and proceeded to suck and hurt the game? Yeah, it's throwing. If they happen to be angry, pick Sym, and then try their hardest to win? Even if they still suck and hurt the game? That's not throwing. It's dumb maybe, but not throwing.

It kind of depends really. Did they play Sym for a bit, realize the pick was out of anger and switch? Did they play Sym the whole time, and do alright? Did they play Sym, put her turrets in right places, spam her orbs in the right chokes, etc, but still just didn't cut it? You can't determine if they are throwing without the entire story.

I honestly don't know if this is a popular opinion or not, but I think most would have to agree that waiting an entire year for these special modes to come around is quite annoying and pretty unnecessary.

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, because I love this game to death aside from issues of toxicity and whatnot, but the game is pretty low on the content department and there isn't a whole lot to keep both casual and the more competitive players interested for extended periods of time.

Hence, I think that keeping these modes permanent would grant more overall longevity to the game. Wether it would be in the custom modes, or part of the weekly brawl rotation, it'd be a really awesome Christmas present for sure!

Oh, and on a side note, keeping competitive Lúcioball permanent (although separate from standard comp) would be a real game changer, as it would allow the more casual players to get a taste of the competitive feel without being too burdened as well as having the more competitive minded players the ability to try something new or different, the possibilities are endless.",12/19/2017 06:04 AM,"{""id"":""207591182995"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207515778971"",""name"":""Crossfade""}}",post-1,55 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/steelerssuck12,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000009E1.png,Should seasonal event modes be permanent?,1001

I just wanna play uprising again and having to wait a year feels like BS. They should rotate season events weekly in the arcade.

Hello, please understand I only mean to ask.

I'll try and keep this short, but I think you all deserve the context in which I'm coming from. I'm not intending to sound like a whiner, or thinks I'm better than I am. I truly just want to explain and hope there's a light at the end of the tunnel. With the recent changes to competitive I would like to have my story heard.

I currently am a platinum player in competitive. I have been gold and stayed in plat on the verge of diamond. However the season I have a problem with is Season 2,

Now I know what you would say just get another account, however I love my items I've worked hard for, I would be happy to if I know it's the only way but you don't know if you don't ask.

So please blizzard help me by just letting me know what to do.

Thanks for the game and the experience I have had.

??? Bruhh moira literally has the lowest primary dps... bruh seriously... no one is disagreeing that Moira has insane levels of range but that s literally the trade off of her very smol 50dps...

Bruhhh moira literally has a 200 damage orb + right click + self heal leeching + a better dash than tracer

Bruhhhhh I literally saw a moira walk into a full health reinhardt and he died in 2 seconds. Bruhhhhhhhhhhh i played Tracer on a koth map and both Moiras beat me to the point bruhhhhhh!! ??????

Do the math, a moira solo killing a rein at full health is impossible in two seconds. Moira's primary does 50 damage per second. Moira's orb does 50 damage too. So at max potential, Moira's highest possible damage output (without outside interference like being Damage Boosted, etc.) is 100dps. It'll take the her 5 solid seconds to kill Rein with his 500 overall health. 5 seconds, theoretically. And that's without considering the slight damage reduction Rein has from his initial 200armor. Nor does it consider the fact that theres a high chance of Moira's orb leaving the 5m radius that it tethers to damage Rein. Nor the fact that her orbs will only deal a max damage of 200, meaning at best if tethers it self solely to Rein and deals 200 damage to Rein for 4 seconds and that Moira is also using secondary fire on Rein for that 4 seconds to shave off 400 of Reins HP (again calculations neglecting the minor damage reduction from Armor type hp). After that 4 seconds Rein will still have 100hp and Moira, having only secondary fire to deal damage, would take 2 seconds to finish him off. So at best it would take Moira 6 seconds to solo kill a Rein. So your statement of a Moira solo killing Rein in 2seconds is nigh impossible.

Moira's Fade apparently has a speed of 18.75m/s with a duration of .8, giving Moira a maximum range of movement during Fade of 15m. After Fade, Moira has a base speed of 5.5m/s that she'll have to make do for 6seconds while Fade is in cooldown.

Tracer's Blink moves her 7.5meters into the direction she wants practically immediately. This ability has a 3 second CD. Outside of abilities Tracer has a base movement speed of 6m/s.

So let's recap. Moira has a 15m dash at a 6second CD, Tracer has a 7.5m dash at 3seconds CD. In these values both Moita and Tracer has the same speed. But Moira's dash isn't as instantaneous as Tracer's, in fact as I've said Fade has a duration of .8 seconds. So effectively, in these of abilities it takes Tracer 6seconds (in terms of ability CD) to move 15m. While Moira can move 15m every 6.8 seconds. That .8 seconds stacks up over time so Tracer moves faster than Moira in terms of Fade vs Blink.

Not only this, Tracer has a higher movement speed. Let's take the 6s CD (the gap it takes between Moira's Fade and Tracer to have two charges of Blink, which allows both to move 15m not considering the .8 difference due to Moira's fade duration) again for example. During that 6seconds Tracer would be able to move 36m while Moira is able to travel 33m. So again Tracer is obviously faster.

But wait, there's more. Tracer has a whooping 3 charges of Blink at the start of the match. Giving her a total burst dash of 22.5m at the start of the match. That's 7.5 more than Moira's initial dash.

So basically, Tracer is very much able to reach the point on a KotH map, where both spawns are equally distant from the point, against Moira. The difference is that Tracer would often save her Blink charges after the inital 3 bursts, while Moira has to use her Fade every 6seconds to put it on CD. This gameplay differences are a not a fault of Moira's kit.

In recap or TL;DR
You first point is bogus as it will take Moira to solo kill a Rein roughly 6seconds not 2 seconds like you claimed.

And your second point is situational. Tracer is faster and is very much able to reach the first point in a KotH map before Moira.

So, bruhhh, do the math.

Bruh...

Edit: bruh, my dude, she does 50 damage per second. It literally takes her 4 seconds to kill a 200hp hero. Bruh... you had 4 seconds to get out to find cover, get a health pack, find your healer, hide behind a tank, anything really. Her hp is 200, you can literally just 2 shot her... bruh...


At eichenwalde at the first point I was at the ceiling with pharah AND SHE COULD STILL HIT ME!!! There aint much cover in the sky and I think its kinda bs that you can attach a damage dealing attack to a pharah at that hight all her mobity is focussed on staying in the air and avoiding attacks.

> Complains about a hero who has 20meter range ticklebeam that cannot pass barriers and can be LOS'ed
> Plays a hero who can fly and has no falloff rockets which means infinite range and less ways of LOS'ing rockets doing 120dmg per direct hit and 80dmg huge splash

Think pharah players lately are just super salty that there is now a hero who doesn't need gm level aim in order to hit them lol. Even if it's just with a ticklebeam.

Just beg for a mercy pocket why don't you if you have so much problems with a single support hero.


GM level aim to hit a Pharah hahahaha funny.",12/19/2017 07:33 AM,"{""id"":""207591782523"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207573387531"",""name"":""TortleTurtle""}}",post-34,4 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/TortleTurtle-2362,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000012D4.png,Moira's range...,1001
"I had originally posted this as a reply to a thread regarding widow noire, but it didn't get much attention. I think it deserves some.

ORIGINAL POST
I have a very unpopular opinion, but as someone who did nexus challenges from the first oni genji i was quite disappointed when the same thing came back because people protested not being able to get it. And then, if two times wasn't enough, it was added to loot boxes. And then (don't get me wrong here i'm ok with this) duplicates stopped being a thing so if you open enough boxes you'll find the skin.

So oni genji, which since last january i felt so proud of owning, became a regular skin. Ok. But at least do a promotion for widow noire or something! I know, you'll say that I was lucky to get oni genji for free a good 4 months before everyone else, but people with widow noire got the game BEFORE ANYONE and got rewarded with a skin. If they released it now, even just for game of the year (although I bought origins before it was game of the year so don't try that WELL PEOPLE WHO PREORDERED DIDNT KNOW IT WOULD BE A SUCCESS), people would have it a year and a half before everyone else. I'm pretty salty about being on the losing side for oni genji (i also got officer dva through the nexus challenges but it's not as important a skin) and widow noire.

Sorry for all this wall of text, but I feel everything i wrote is significant and can't be summarised. I know i'll receive dislikes, you just have to name the noire skin to get dozens, but i don't care. This is my opinion, and nobody will ever change it.",12/19/2017 07:23 AM,"{""id"":""207592579202"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207416904609"",""name"":""Markar""}}",post-1,503 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Markar-2254,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008C1.png,Another VERY unpopular opinion,1001

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season

""During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.

It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.""",12/19/2017 07:26 AM,"{""id"":""207590482416"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207529923708"",""name"":""Terx2""}}",post-9,801 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Terx2-1856,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001321.png,Beachrat,1002

One of these things is not like the other, one of these things doesn't need to aim damage.

Symmetra is really good at punishing.

Bad aim? Punished by a gun that does not require aim
Bad position? Punished by close range power
Bad priority? Well that charge 3 gun is pretty intense if you leave Symmetra unchecked.

Symmetra starts with a measily 7.5 damage per instance, and 4 instances per second (30dps)
Soldier can deal 38 damage with one headshot, and iirc deals 8 instances per second?

Sym also has a very very short range (7-9.5 meters) and most heroes have the mobility to escape that.

Bottom line, Symmetra only really gets kills by punishing poor play. Which is a good design for a support hero whos main objective is not geting kills, its mitigating damage to allies.

Even if you don't have the greatest aim, it's not hard to just stay away from her. Nobody runs up to reinhardt with no fear (unless he's already weak, or if you're reaper/junkrat)

Sombra? Whatever. I agree she could also use some buffs, but i dont think she is in as bad a place as sym right now, sym is very easily countered. Sombra isn't extremely counterable, she's just relatively less effective compared to other options",12/19/2017 07:07 AM,"{""id"":""207591481852"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207533699587"",""name"":""Creati""}}",post-4,493 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Creati-11923,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C3F.png,Symmetra & Sombra have 3 things in common,1002

That's true, you start to notice the completely opposite differences, like
- how you pointed out - Symmetra works with no coordination, Sombra works with heavy coordination.

You get praised for killing streak as a Sombra, you still get toxic slurs with Symmetra.

>take genjis small sword or what ever it's called, lets just call it a sword.
>stretch your arm out as far as possible, hold the sword so the tip is away from you
>woah? do you see how far that sword is a way from your body?

that's how genjis hitbox works. The animation and visual effects are COMPLETELY OFF from the hitbox so it seems ""big""

yes genjis deflect is getting a nerf where if the hitbox goes through a wall, it can't deflect. That's great.

Deflect isn't even OP or huge. I am currently a hard stuck diamond player and I can't tell you how many times I deflect at a good time just to have the enemy player look at me like ""okay..."" it's not difficult to stop shooting a deflect, it's loud, the visual effects show that he's deflecting. so there is NO REASON for you to shoot anywhere at genji, or anything around him. It takes 5 minutes of playing against a genji to see the size of his hitbox and memorize it's size.

about 95% of the players who complain about genji are in a low rank
and yes i am bringing up the rank argument because the lower rank you are the less game sense you have, the less aim you have, the less reaction you have and it's a simple fact.

I played genji at my friends house (he's in silver) and i can't tell you how many people literally shoot at my deflect at a point blank period. If I tried that in diamond nothing would happen, deflect is only good to break shields when everyone is spraying (enemy side) and deflect is good for a surprise deflect like on a widow or mccree flash. But if genji deflects and YOU are still shooting him then clearly it's your fault, not his ""hitbox""

""but if i shoot genji from the back it deflects to the front""
yeah that can be changed i don't see why it should shoot at the front of him but if you're shooting genjis sides, the deflcet should stop further damage or velocity if it hits his deflect from the back (makes sense)

""but genji can cancel deflect with shift and it's unexpected""
well if a genji is in a dashing distance and you are at a low HP then it's actually extremely predictable that he is about to dash at you and it's your reaction that is going to get you saved or not

""genji is OP, over loaded kit, too OP""
well that genji that's kicking your butt is going to climb out of your current rank and go to a rank he belongs in.

If you don't play genji in competitive (this does NOT include quickplay, arcade, custom games) you can't say he's OP. You need to play him in comp to actually get his real strength and weakness. If you're crying about genji and you have like 30 minutes on him in comp then you clearly never played genji. You clearly never experienced how difficult his kit can be and how annoying it is to get countered a lot. Don't say something is OP if you never played it competitively.

""GenJi Has 2 CouNTers""
no he doesn't, he has a few counters and when he gets hard countered It's extremely annoying to play genji (this is coming from a genji main)

One game I played had a winston (i was a genji) and my team told me ""swap off genji they got a winston"" i said ""im not swapping unless hes countering me""
btw, that winston never jumped on me once while I was wrecking their team. If a winston catches you off guard (dash on cooldown) you're pretty much dead.

""stoopid genji main just doesnt want his main nerfed""
lol idc if genji gets nerfed, idc if any of my mains get nerfed. There is 26 heroes and I can main any of them. i mained doomfist and I was all with the hitbox nerf and his rocket punch nerf but really these ""nerf genji"" threads are insane ""nerf double jump"" ""remove dash reset on kill"" lol??? just simple troll threads that will change. Yall remembered the mass nerf doomfist threads? now it's genji and nerf genji threads are actually dying, it's becoming nerf junkrat threads. You know the nerf junkrat threads only started to appear after like 2 months of junkrats buff lol. People just started to play junkrat more and started to realize his actual strengths. not many people were even mentioning his double bomb as OP, just junkrat itself was ""OP"" it's because not many people were playing him and when ever a hero gets a rework/buff more people play them and realize how good junkrat actually is. what if symettra got a normal buff and you started to see her A LOT in your games and then you're going to see ""nerf sym"" threads talking about how her beam is super OP and how her turrets are OP. this forum is a joke honestly.

why does everyone play genji?
hes a fun hero, he has a fun kit, he has high mobility, requires high reaction speed, hence why i started to play him.

but in all honestly, stop crying over a hero you never played competitively with then people will actually start taking your ""nerf genji"" threads seriously.

"Deflect hitbox is ridiculous and broken and it should not be that big, even if you're not shooting at him he still Deflects it. Deflect hitbox should match Genji size and not the size of a tank. Plus he has too many advantages like double jump hides his critbox, double jump makes it easier for him to land headshots, forces u to wait out Deflect even if there's other people shooting at u because if u try to shoot at them he Deflects it, and there is no way to dodge his dash. I can confirm that it takes little skill for Genji to kill u but it takes HIGH skill for u to kill

"QUICK MAFS

The shortest length of a Wakizashi is 30cm

Genji's height is 5'7 which converted to metric is 174cm

Let's assume Mercy knew basic proportions when rebuilding Genji

In that case his wingspan should also be 174cm

From some of Genji's official designs, I'm going to estimate his torso takes up 2/7 of this wingspan

(174÷7)x2=50cm (torso) (174-50)÷2=62cm per arm, so with his sword he has 92cm of reach.

If u don't believe me, watch these videos even his ult hitbox is ridiculous too

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-91CXd6vCsU


>Take genjis arm
>photoshop it so his arm is pointing 90 degrees
>photoshop his small sword in his arm
>his hitbox range

that's exactly how his hitbox works. I've already seen those videos and his hitbox looks fine to me, the only issue is that the animation and visual effects are completely off from his hitbox which should be fixed.


Of course you think it's fine, you're Genji. Anything wrong with him is good, anything bad needs to be fixed or we riot.

Secondly, who cares if it's anatomically correct for his range, it's broken for a video game. Heck, we got robots and people shooting some magical beams that heal and crap. For the game, he has a completely broken hitbox on it. It requires no skill to jump in front of an already shooting target and deflect everything back at them.

thirdly, you can stop shooting him and think you have a clear shot on another target and BAM, shot yourself for some stupid reason.",12/19/2017 06:54 AM,"{""id"":""207590982307"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""184563541828"",""name"":""TooLateNow""}}",post-17,2753 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/TooLateNow-1933,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001153.png,GenJi DeFleCt HiT BoX Is ToO BiG,1002

His deflect hitbox is the same size as doomfists rocket punch when he was first released.

There is a forum post with a lot of video evidence of this.

Not to mention if he is behind a hero you are shooting and he deflects, you can die. Makes sense right?
Fortunately that can be avoided altogether by not intentionally shooting at (or around in some cases?) a deflecting Genji. I don't think there were many precautions to Doomfist's truck sized one shot fist.


how can you avoid it if he’s deflecting behind you lmao. the hitbox stretches well beyond the animation, expecting people to just stop shooting in the general vicinity of him is outrageous. you could be aiming at someone next to him and he’ll still be able to deflect it.

just give us a better/more accurate a visual indication of the hitbox or nerf it, idc which one.",12/19/2017 07:01 AM,"{""id"":""207592381992"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207519477502"",""name"":""issh0man""}}",post-19,2806 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/issh0man-1306,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D58.png,GenJi DeFleCt HiT BoX Is ToO BiG,1002

if he's deflecting behind you then it's your teams fault that they are shooting him. It's really common in gold that people shoot genjis deflect and or around genji all the time.
""expecting people to stop shooting in the general area"" the area isn't that big or to imagine his hitbox size. This is probably what's stopping you from climbing out of gold. Try to deflect in low diamond - top 500 they will just stop shooting at genji in general. It's only what, 2 seconds to stop shooting around him?

""you could be aiming at someone next to him and he’ll still be able to deflect it.""
so look how far genji is from the enemy. do you need to question if his hitbox is near the person? then dont shoot him. if you dont need to question it then shoot him. It's literally common sense, I don't know how hard it is to figure that out. It only took me 10 minutes of playing against a genji to realize the animation and visual effects didnt match his hitbox and it only took me 3 minutes to figure out not to shoot around him. YOu can do the same.

If that's your mind set then you can easily climb out.

Do you understand the concepts of positioning, zoning, pressuring, body-blocking, peeling, etc. that are all relatively less tangible than something like ""Damage done""?

Stats only matter within context. If you are excelling and helping your team win games in ways that are not accounted for in the specific stats that influence your SR than you're being punished for not stat padding.

Why create an incentive that baits people into playing worse so they can hedge their bets on the SR system treating them favorably?

Why do people think individual performance based gain/loss is bad? I see no downside to keeping it. You should be judged on how you play, not on how you team collectively plays.
Do you understand the concepts of positioning, zoning, pressuring, body-blocking, peeling, etc. that are all relatively less tangible than something like ""Damage done""?

Stats only matter within context. If you are excelling and helping your team win games in ways that are not accounted for in the specific stats that influence your SR than you're being punished for not stat padding.

Why create an incentive that baits people into playing worse so they can hedge their bets on the SR system treating them favorably?

If you're having a net positive effect on your matches that will show up in your W/L given time.

It will hopefully get rid of the 20 point gains, 40 point losses. All in all I think it will be a good thing.


Perhaps I was mistaken, but I thought that was because of MMR.
I think both factor in, but if you consistently play and place in mid diamond for example and had a particularly bad game the losses in sr could be ridiculously harsh. That I think has more to do with the personal performance than mmr.",12/18/2017 08:59 PM,"{""id"":""207591381342"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207452182968"",""name"":""ShadowHunter""}}",post-9,204 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Cross_Nomad,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000015AE.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

That guy would eventually just drop out of your rank because there is a good chance he isn't winning that many games. At first it might suck but they are all going to trickle out of the super high ranks after a while.
You would hope so, but the fact that throwers are even in higher ranks at all indicates for sure they aren't necessarily throwing all the time. The particular game I mentioned was in mid-high Diamond, on the Xbox. My point focuses on the specific game you're in where someone else happens to be throwing, and minimizing the losses you take from that game. It doesn't matter what rank you're in (or what platform you're on), you can always run into someone who's going to throw.",12/19/2017 07:00 AM,"{""id"":""207590782758"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207430680585"",""name"":""MofoMan2000""}}",post-10,4120 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/MofoMan2000-1452,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C79.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

Edit: Yes, downvote me without answering my question. I don't have a bad opinion, I have an ignorant opinion. Downvoting won't change my opinion, answering my question will.


The reason is that the system is flawed. There's some inherent bug in it, due to how it was designed, comparing peoples performance specifically based on the character they play rather than their performance relative to the people in the game they're currently in.

I'll admit i like it too, because it motivates people to not give up, which you see in other games CONSTANTLY (LoL), but even though they fixed the character I was concerned about, it's probably for the best they dropped the system they have.

Currently I'm feeling like i'm getting too much elo now on Soldier. I was getting royally screwed for 2 seasons, now i'm getting too much and it doesn't feel fair. This eases my conscience now that i've noticed it probably being overtuned that I don't have to go around making posts to the devs because they're already a solution in the works.",12/19/2017 07:08 AM,"{""id"":""207592579198"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207422285238"",""name"":""Dolphin""}}",post-13,1729 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Dolphin-12537,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000009EB.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

I'm a girl that loves playing ana. I like to help my team out and I play ana well. But I keep getting flamed to play mercy bc she's ""so much better.""

In a way my team is right mercy offers so much right now. This makes me sad.

This is a competitive game after all and typically the team that can play better win.

I don't think is all her fault junkrat makes it impossible to heal tanks and his tire always kills me.

I hate that other heros have to get nerfed for others to be good but this is all really unfair

I got crapton of SR playing ana once i got like +40 SR from carrying the game where i had like 2 deaths and 50+ offensive assist. Like i said if you play ana incorrectly you'll have super high healing but low damage, low offensive assist, low defensive assist, low elimination and most likely low sleep dart target.

Thus is the reason why you have low SR gain. You boast one stats and has every other thing a low as possible.

It's not because of golden weapons that I play comp, it's a plus, but not the reason. I like trying, apparently you don't. Giving them to QP just makes them super prevalent and since there's nothing to lose in QP people will just grind them their because it doesn't even account for skill so a smurf group can just crush games for them.",12/19/2017 06:58 AM,"{""id"":""207592579191"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207468489387"",""name"":""Terranguard""}}",post-2,9904 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Terranguard-11978,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000005F8.png,Remove Golden gun from comp,1002

"Sometimes you can deny a lot more damage by shining your matrix where it'll be going, rather than where it's coming from. For example, if a friendly Pharah uses her ult, you can be pretty sure several enemies are going to start shooting at her. It's almost impossible to be in a position to block all the shots from their source, but you can cover Pharah directly.

That's probably the easiest example, but being aware of any time a teammate is about to be focused down is what D.va is best used for, and no other tank is nearly as effective at this play style. Always be ready to boost over to cover a teammate getting focused and prioritize this over almost everything else.",12/19/2017 06:18 AM,"{""id"":""207591681628"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""196469401190"",""name"":""Sneepy""}}",post-7,97 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Sneepy-1908,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000657.png,What do I need to work at as D.va?,1002

Prioritize your meka's survivability over others (unless its something obvious like a stunned or hooked teammate) and play her more agressively focusing their unhealed dps or zenyatta/mercy.

"Its pretty clear that compared to the ""healthy"" healers (lucio Zenyatta ana) Moira provides the most stable high volume Healing AND Damage. Additionally for no reason at all her Orbs have high utility capable of penetrating shields and clearing poor underpowered Symmetra's turret nests with no risk or skill.

The Orbs should either have narrower effective ranges or be slowed down by shields to mitigate that only 2 characters(genji and diva) can stop Moira's orbs both of whom were considered top tier without being necessary to counter the new Super healer. Otherwise perhaps shooting them should alter their trajectory?

Overall having the new strongest non-ultimate ability have very little counterplay seems like a decision that should be reviewed",12/19/2017 06:10 AM,"{""id"":""207590883040"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":15},""author"":{""id"":""187538520250"",""name"":""JonSnow""}}",post-1,192 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/JonSnow-1881,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000002488.png,Moiras Orbs are OP,1002
