Info about a ~paid~ relationship + sexual health study for male couples! :),"Hello! My name is Arielle and I'm a queer researcher and relationship skills coach at Northwestern University. I want to give you guys some info about 2GETHER, a project we have going on for male couples.

2GETHER is a paid research study that involves a relationship education program-- where you and your partner can learn skills to strengthen your relationship, like improving your communication, sexual health and satisfaction. We have a national online program and an in-person program for people who live in Chicago.

There will be follow-up surveys and free at-home STI testing before and after the 2GETHER program. Because we're a university, all data we collect is protected by IRB and federal regulations. If you and your partner are eligible, you'll get to read over a consent form, which has more information about your privacy rights.

And obviously we're going to pay you for your time-- specifically $250 each for completing all parts of the study!

Want to find out if you qualify, or learn more? Check out our eligibility screener: [https://redcap.nubic.northwestern.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=YXKMW9JFXY](https://redcap.nubic.northwestern.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=YXKMW9JFXY)

[Academic] Survey Exploring the Impact of Discrimination Against Atheists,"  

Hello,

My name is Jacob Miranda. I am a psychology graduate student at Angelo State University, San Angelo, TX. I am posting in regards to a request I would like to make. To date, there is very little research about atheists, with one study documenting only 100 articles within a span of 10 years. Most of these studies were focused on outsiders‚Äô perceptions of atheists. In addition, out of those 100, only one incorporated the intersection between sexual orientation and atheism.

I would like to survey atheists on their experiences with discrimination and investigate if those experiences impact well-being. Below is a link to an online survey, with an informed consent for that has more information about this study. This is on a strictly voluntary basis. No personal contact information will be collected (names, addresses, e-mail, IP Address).

The only requirements we have is those who participate **must be:**

**A) 18 years or older**

**B) Self-identify as an atheist**

Please use the below link to access the survey‚Äôs consent form. The consent form provides a description of the nature of the study, as well as information about your confidentiality. 

The survey **takes about 15 minutes** to complete.

World of Warcraft - LGBT+ Guild (EU Horde),"**The  Admiral Duncan is the WoW guild of the London Gaymers, based on the  Draenor (EU) server playing on the Horde side. It was formed in 2016 and  is one of the largest European LGBT+ guilds in the game, but thankfully  with the new World of Warcraft Expansion we can now have a community no  matter what realm you are on.**

We  have members from all over the United Kingdom as well as from Western  Europe. We want to ensure London Gaymers has inclusive IRL spaces as  well as online communities to help foster relationships with people from  outside London, with the WoW guild forming a key part of that.

As  a part of London Gaymers it‚Äôs important that we continue to embody and  support the values that LG uphold. To enable this we don‚Äôt have a  requirement to join the guild as we see ourselves as a safe community  and home for WoW players from all walks of life. As well as the online  events and raids we run, we organise events for players to come together  and enjoy their time in game. The majority of our events are ‚Äúopen‚Äù  which means anyone who wants to come along, can come along, as the aim  of the guild is to foster a safe place for people to enjoy a game that  we all love!

With the next Battle For Azeroth Expansion, we are also ensuring that LGBT+ people who are in  other guilds and other EU Realms (and playing Horde) can join in to our  events by joining our community and using this to find new Dungeon, Raid  and Questing partners from all other EU realms.

Can I give some feedback to Star Trek Discovery?,"HI 

Also Spoilers!!!!!!

TL;DR
pls stop killing queers as plot points/ character development 

Just wanna say I LOVE this show. I loved all the Star Trek shows because of the story-driven narrative, great characters (with the exception of an unnamed Talaxian) and progressive attitude.

The one thing I was saddened by was the death of Dr. Hugh Culber. As a geeky little gay boy, I was desperate as a child for any representation in my sci-fi of queer characters. Scifi was my way of imagining a future where gay people were equal and treated fairly and it was something in was rarely able to find. My heart nearly exploded when the series revealed the Dr. Culber was in a committed relationship with LT. Stamets. FINALLY GAYS IN SPACE.
I allowed my self to get really invested in that relationship even though it was sidelined for more heteronormative relationships storylines (which is fine, the showrunner relationship deserves more attention), and also traditionally queer relationships often end horribly in television and cinema RE: Bury Your Gays Trope. But i was sure that such a progressive socially aware show wouldent fall into boring typicall tv tropes....... and then..... sigh.

So I'm so incredibly sad that once again there is no happy ending for the only queer characters so far. I'm sad that such an overused trope was used to tug my heartstrings. BUT I get it, queer people have to die in media sometime, it's ridiculous to say "" NO GAYS CAN EVER DIE IN MEDIA!"" 

What is really killing me the most is the underwhelming reaction the other characters have to Culbers death. No one seems to care! More attention is given to Michael and Ash's relationship troubles which pale in comparison to Lt Stamets losing his LIFE PARTNER to MURDER. I found it hard to care about their couple month long relationship coming to an end when Paul loses the love of his life.

So if I could feedback to the writers I would like to identify the behaviour of killing queer characters and not giving the death the proper emotional weight as other characters deaths/ relationships. The impact this behavior has on the queer community is that it makes us feel that even our most traumatic/ painful experiences aren't equal to straight people relationship problems. it makes us feel like our lives are dispensable as long as it carries forward the plot of straight characters.

Element collecting,"I was wondering if there are any other gay geeks out there collecting the chemical elements.

Here's my story: I built a 7 foot wide wooden periodic table shadow box (with arduino-controlled lights), and started making YouTube videos about the elements I've collected. I set this up as a challenge for myself though:

Challenge #1: I'm not ordering any elements or chemicals off of the Internet.  I'm getting everything from real-world places in Portland, Oregon. (Glassware is an exception. I haven't found affordable test tubes in meat space)

Challenge #2: Samples obtained must be reasonably pure elements, not compounds. (I may make exceptions for elements that are both unreasonable to obtain in pure form, and unreasonably difficult to extract in visible quantities.)

Progress so far: I've just published my ninth episode, and put my ninth element on my table. In order of acquisition, I have:
Aluminum, Lead, Zinc, Carbon, Tin, Bismuth, Magnesium, Copper, and Silver.
I plan on adding Gallium in this weekend's episode, and Hydrogen, Chlorine, and Manganese in the coming weeks (not necessarily in that order)

Anyway, I hope it's ok to post a link to my channel, for anyone who wants to see the videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsup2khgX7Ol70qqXhRHwGQ",gaygeek

Creating a Board Game.,"Hey everyone, my friends and I are big board game geeks. We play many all the time, we get together about 1-2 times a week and play. 

We have played games such as:

BSG
Alchemists
Shadows Of Brimstone
Mage Knight
Student Bodies
Pandemic
Catan
Betrayal at the House on the Hill,
Legend of Drizzt
Eldritch Horror

So on and so forth. I decided in my spare time I wanted to develop a board game. I am very creative and love the idea of creating something of my own.

The reason I am posting here is because I wanted to ask you all. What are your favorite mechanics in Board Games?

Preferably games like Shadows of Brimstone, Legends of Drizzt, games that you can play multiple times with multiple stories and missions.

I really want to make an awesome game that I can bring to not only game nights with my friends but other places around Chicago to show people and get feedback and develop it even further!

Thanks everyone!

**EDIT** 
I really wanted to make a Zombie game loosely based off Shadows of Brimstone. With the tile placement and Characters. I love that game, but I think a zombie version would be awesome because the possibilities are endless. I just want to know what kind of mechanics people have liked in the past.

Tineye and Google image search - Good for busting liars?,"Wow, I'm a bit frustrated right now. Never trust anyone on the Interwebz is the lesson I just re-learned tonight. Sorry for this rant and I'm prepared to be downvoted, but what the hell...

I was chatting all afternoon with a nice fellow on an IRC channel. He was interested in becoming a nudist, just as me. He was bisexual, just as me. He seemed like a pleasant fellow and the exhibitionist in me took over and I sent some frisky pictures that he responded that he liked.

I started to get curious how the guy I was chatting with looked like and asked very nicely if he could send me a picture. I said it hadn't have to be a nude one. And if he did not want to share a picture, I would be okay with that too.
But he complied and in return the most beautiful man showed up in a photo.

It was a bit too fucking good. The geek in me commanded me to run the picture through a simple image search.  I just had to run it trough Google Picture search and Tineye. Just. In. Case. 

And of course... It was a picture that had been plastered over the whole god damn Internet. A whole bunch of Tumblr-blogs, a Pornhub account with the picture as an avatar (were it seemed to belong to a single dude from Britain, while the guy I was chatting with was Canadian) and a bunch of other places.

I called him out and said I would be more than happy to be proved wrong. But instead he said good bye and disconnected. Busted I guess?

**TL;DR - Be careful sharing pictures on the Internet. But please don't fucking lie when people try to be nice. :(**",gaygeek

Matt Smith has tons of gay sex in pre-war Germany,"Seriously. The movie's on Netflix, it's called [Christopher And His Kind](https://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70178688?trkid=200250783), and it's the story of author Christopher Isherwood's time spent in pre-war Germany as a sex tourist. 

It was a [BBC TV movie from 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_and_His_Kind_%28film%29), and I'll be damned if it doesn't play like an episode of Doctor Who meets Tales Of The City meets Cabaret. There's quite a bit of nudity, so if you've ever shipped the eleventh doctor and various background characters from history, this is the movie for you.

It's also a fascinating portrait of the rise of fascism, the place of homosexuality in a society in turmoil, and the economic roots of prostitution. But don't let that stop you... Matt Smith! Mostly naked! With naked guys!",gaygeek

When it sees the url of a company that it has a match for in the database it inserts an icon to let you know. The icons are colored green, yellow and red to correspond to the companies score.

"The Pride, an LGBT superhero comic series, has a new issue out: The Pride Adventures#2!","""I highly recommend this smart, charming, wonderful book to anyone who likes good comics. It's absolutely a pleasure to read and a clear labor of love."" - Gail Simone (Batgirl, Secret Six, Red Sonja, Tomb Raider)

The Pride follows a diverse cast of superheroes who are all LGBTQ as they come together to improve representation in the superhero community. In the main series, The Pride, they come up against resistance both of the normal and supervillainous variety, and in The Pride Adventures, we get lots of shorter self contained stories expanding on the characters and world of the series.

We've just released the first new issue of 2014, The Pride Adventures #2 featuring four new short stories, as a digital first comic.

You can learn more about The Pride and see art by our incredible team of artists including Kris Anka, W. Scott Forbes, Chris Wildgoose and more over at the Facebook Page (www.facebook.com/ThePrideComic).

You can buy The Pride online from the store at www.thepride.bigcartel.com

It's all about having more characters out there for the LGBT comic fans to relate to, and exploring ideas of diversity, representation and 'gay issues' in such a way as to show them as what they are: human issues, which affect everyone. 

Anyway, please check us out, and please let us know what you think :)",gaygeek

There are people of all races, disabled people, non-monogamous, hippies, business types, people just out for sex... the basic variety you'd get if you put an ad up on Craigslist. What aspects of dating do you think are underrepresented in dating sims? What aspects of gay culture do you think are important for this type of thing, if any?

How Strong is Your Kung-Fu?,"Surely, I simply cannot be the only gay man who has a thing for kung-fu movies?

Not just classic Kung-Fu, with the three saints of Hong Kong cinema (being, of course, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Sonny Chiba).  Not to mention ""Ol' Dirty"" Yuen Siu-tien and the lot.  A thousand iterations of the same story, but you still love the same ol' story every time.

Not just the middle era with all the ""cable-fu"" - movies with Aaron Kwok and other dancers-made-fighters flying through the air.  With disconnected, dyspeptic stories that make *no sense* are just one long non-sequitur.

And not just the recent Kung-Fu revival, with Stephen Chow bringing back the old guard, with stories that make sense and are actually slightly different from each other.  I don't just mean *Shaolin Soccer* or *Kung-Fu Hustle*, but also stuff like *Detective Dee* or *Taichi Zero*.  With the exception of maybe jumping off a building and gracefully landing, or maybe hitting someone so hard they go flying, the special effects and cables are really toned down and actual fighters with actual skill take center stage.

Now, I'm sure I accept the fact that I'm one of the few gay men out there who also has a thing for the classic Luchador films (Vampire?  screw garlic; jump off the top ropes.  Werewolf?  screw silver; suplex.  Evil sorcer?  headscissor takedown), but I somehow refuse to live on assuming there are no other gay men who collect kung fu movies.

Or is this more of a /gaygeek topic, or more for the /gaybros?  Kung fu from the 60s and 70s makes me think ""geek"", though I suppose the fundamentally badass nature of the genre perhaps speaks more to ""bros""?",gaygeek
"A more ""pure"" geek?","There's an idea that's been bugging me for a while, and I just wanted to see what other people thought of it; does a geek obsession get ""ruined"" by sexualizing it?  I mean... if it's already sexy, then obviously not.  Sexualizing John Creighton from Farscape or 7 of 9 is just... proper, really.  I mean really now... Ben Bowder....  

But anyway, let me explain.

I remember when Queer as Folk was first remade in the USA, and the change in geek obsession really bothered me.  In the original UK version, Vince was all about Dr Who, and had every episode made so far (this was before the ultra-cool reboot, and even seemed to have the episodes from the 60s).  Although he wasn't exactly averse to getting laid, there were other times when he was like ""can't screw now; sci fi is on"".  His loving Dr Who wasn't about sex or fetishes or any of that - he was just a fan of the thing.

Then in the USA version, Mike's character was obsessed with comics, but not because of the politics or story-telling or speculative fiction side or any of the stuff that most geeks who love comics love them for.  Oh no.  They made it seem like it was all about muscled guys running around in spandex.  I don't recall them ever once talking about metaphors or social commentary; just bulges.  It didn't seem authentic to me.  There's sex and romance and whatnot in comics, of course, but it's only half the story.  If you ignore the content and only focus on the superficial fleshy bits it seems to me that you're not really a ""geek"" so much as you are just a soft-core appreciator who happens to enjoy alternative sources for titillation.

I haz a dating question...,"I'd ask r/gaymers since it seems to be more active, but I think I identify myself more as just a gay geek, so I'll ask you guys.

I'm in my mid-20s, average looking, mild stutter, never been in a relationship, never gone on a second date with anyone. I'll meet a guy (generally on Grindr or OkCupid cuz I'm terrible at meeting guys) who seems to be relationship material, sometimes the guy doesn't just want sex. We'll text a lot, he is either interested or is just nice, then maybe after a week it starts to take longer for him to respond to texts, or he just doesn't respond at all. If I do get him answering, he says he's busy. This happens A LOT! In fact, I'd even venture to say it happens every time.

I'm 95% sure what I'm saying in the texts and the frequency of the texts are not what is driving them off. How do I know the guy just lost interest, he really is busy, or I actually am crazy? I met the basically perfect guy (he's in my league, he has my dream job, he's really nice and funny, etc) but he takes a LONG time to respond to texts, or he doesn't respond at all. I finally went on a date with him and it seemed perfectly normal; we both equally talked and laughed and such, we didn't kiss or do anything more at the end, and he TOLD me to keep texting him, but he continued to 'be busy.'

I have many people who can vouch for my sanity, so am I just meeting assholes or what?",gaygeek

There is so much LGBT allegory in the Lord of the Rings. 

And at the center of it all is a relationship between two people of the same gender who care so deeply for each other that it sustains them against all odds. Their relationship may be platonic but it is intimate and substantial in ways that if I found romantic relationship that was half that, I would be not for want.

Sci-Fi and Homophobia: Should I care? ,"I've taken to publicly denouncing Orson Scott Card every time that something on reddit comes up that's associated with him. Lately it's mostly been with the movie recreation of ""Ender's Game"". 

OSC is a deeply homophobic man and uses his position and fame to promote discrimination and disinformation against the LGBT community.

Some would argue that I should let his work stand on his own... but i have a problem with financially supporting a man who's goals are to inhibit or eliminate me from having the same rights as other people. 

Am I too hardlined? Ender's Game is pretty consistently in the top 10 sci-fi novels of all time. ",gaygeek

Canton Everett Delaware III: Possibly more badass than Captain Jack (mild Doctor Who spoilers),"Canton Everett [Delaware](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw/characters/Canton) III, companion to the Doctor in the first two episodes season 6 with strong hints that there will be more.

He is a Nixon era renegade former FBI agent, a suit wearing gun carrying smart-mouthed supreme badass.  And as much as I love me some Captain Jack, I think he's winning as the most compelling gay characters I've ever seen on TV.  On what is technically a *children's* show, maybe the most iconic children's show in history, he's absolutely fucking astounding.

Introduced first as an old man who clearly has had extended interactions with the Doctor, then again as his younger self; the ex-FBI agent in 1969, great as his job but fired for unspecified reasons.  He says it was because he wanted to get married, that his marriage would be a crime, with implications of an interracial relationship though in 1969 this was two years after *Loving vs. Virginia* struck down miscegenation laws.

They save the world, and the Doctor exits Nixon's office while saying that Delaware just wants to get married and maybe Nixon could do something about that.  Nixon asks, ""This person you want to marry, they're black?""  Delaware replies ""Yes Mr. President, he is.""

I was worried when RTD left that Doctor Who would rejoin 99% of the rest of science fiction as a universe where straightness is the universal default and everybody is white.  I underestimated Moffat entirely, and I am so excited to see where he takes this character.",gaygeek

As a side note, it's interesting how The Last Herald Mage dates itself depending on where you read it in your coming out process (Wether its emotionally impactful or not) and Flewelling's Nightrunner series is  but she really doesn't focus on the relationship anyway which comes across like she's not entirely comfortable with writing about it even though her intentions are noble.

Anyone else notice that the gay community really likes Star Trek?,"Maybe it's just me... and I admit that's becoming less relevant given that there isn't a show on the air.

However, I would say that the vast majority of my gay friends and acquaintances *aren't* geeks by definition (and still consider ""geek"" a dirty word) but somehow Star Trek seems to have transcended that particular boundary.

Undoubtedly the show paints an idealized world/culture in which we'd all like to belong where one would hope that same sex relationships are not only accepted but are entirely status quo (though the show never actually presented same-sex relationships as such).

I think its appeal will continue some... if for no other reason than the appeal of Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine . :D (and a reasonably compelling story by J.J. Abrams)",gaygeek

What character/actor in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy film made you realize you were gay?,"When I was around 14/15 I was a nerdy, sexually confused teenager.  I felt that there was something different about me, but I couldn't quite understand what it was.  Two movies helped me to pave the way for me accepting that I was gay:

At age 14, I rediscovered the Goonies on VHS, and the film was was revelation.  The nostalgia factor was high, and I noticed something new - I felt strange feelings for the character Mikey (Sean Astin).  Days afterward, I kept thinking about him, so I rented another film that he starred in, White Water Summer.  This was the film that made me practically obsessed with Sean Astin.  I bought a Cutting Crew tape so that I could re-listen to a song prominently featured in the film.  I even bought a NY Yankees hat hat just to be like his character.  Looking back, I realized that I was just horribly attracted to Sean.  He was my first nerdy crush.

My second crush came at age 15, when I watched Star Wars.  I hadn't seen the films since I was in first grade, so re-watching the trilogy felt like the most epic thing I had ever experienced.  I loved it so much that I found myself wanting to live in the galaxy of Star Wars.  The other thing I discovered was that Luke Skywalker was incredibly cute.  I wanted to give him a kiss on his cheek (just like Leia in Ep 4), and I really wanted to watch him parade around with his skimpy shirt in Empire.  

Without any gay characters on TV or in films (that I was aware of at the time), I was forced to look elsewhere for inspiration; anything to make me feel like these feelings were normal.  Fortunately, these films (and characters) somehow helped me to accept that I was gay.  

Anyone care to share their geek-filled moments when they realized that they liked boys/girls?

PS, my gay inspirations:

[The Big Bang Theory] Should Raj come out?,"I preface all of this with the fact that Big Bang Theory skirts (read:clubs you over the head with) being offensive when it comes to how it treats geeks as being the butt of jokes vs celebrating geek culture.

One of the not-so-subtle-subtext of the story is this idea that Raj is ""sensitive"" and ""one of the girls"". It's the butt of the jokes but it's never so malicious that I find it horribly offensive (perhaps I have thick skin). Certainly, they make all these gay-subtext jokes with Raj and his relationship with the group (particularly his relationship with Howard and later Stuart)

However, they have done it so much that I'm left wondering if it's more offensive or less offensive if he were *actually* to come out. If Raj came out, it would be playing to all the stereotypes of being gay by the fact that he lived up to them. If Raj remains straight, they miss out on an opportunity to demonstrate that even within a subculture, we have diversity. BBT would do well to have a gay character. 

I mean his character doesn't have to be a 6 on the Kinsey scale... clearly he can be sexual with women. (No amount of alcohol short of being unconscious would get me to have sex with women) but Raj may think that he has to as a result of pressure from his parents. He's a wrapped up bundle of psychological issues.

I doubt it will ever happen. Chuck Lore doesn't strike me as a person who is socially progressive in his story telling. He's out for a cheap laugh most of the time.

I'll post again on Wednesday (at 3PM) with the voting details, but I wanted to give you a heads up now so you may be prepared in advance. I think we have a real shot of winning, and it could be huge!!!

Thanks for reading my wall of text. I'll have another tomorrow.

P.S. To further entice you, I even 'acted' on camera in our pitch video. At the very least you should appreciate my bad acting!!

The horny-ness graph...,"Sorry, not equipped with any visual aids. Maybe a mathematician out there can plot this out for me?

So I liken horny-ness to be like a value on a graph... That has a periodic drop off (pleasure, self-induced or otherwise)... And I was thinking about its rate of growth... (LOL, growth)

Is there an upper limit to the value of horny-ness, so it's logarithmic or is it more asymptotic?

If it was asymptotic, does that mean someone can be ""infinitely horny"" given enough days of denial?",gaygeek

help a homo out?,"I know nothing about comics. 
But I watched X-Men: First Class and my interest was piqued. I guess you could call me curious.

Can I get some pointers/tips for a budding gay comic geek? I'm already super geeky about the interwebz (memes, etc), I'm also a gent. I'm pretty sure I can't get into video games, but I want to give this comics thing a go. It'll solidify my gay geek/nerd status!

So, what should I do/read/buy?

NOTE: I go to a big university with a huge library (fifth largest in the US, whatwhat), so if there are books/graphic novels you think I should checkout, lemme know!

Another NOTE: I was really into the queer identity/rights undertone of First Class, so anything that taps into that would be greatly appreciated.",gaygeek

"Hey, is there any way to set 'it' so that youtube automatically goes for the 480p option?","Hi there, first post, well, no, first reddit? and here I am trying to suckle on your collective wisdom like some sorta leech or whatever.
So yeah, i'm asking my fellow gaymers, i assume, but in the gaygeek category, you know, cos its more of a technical thing... is it bad that i assume there is some sorta crazy link goin on there? 
But, you know when you load a video on youtube, and its cool, in 360p, so you maximise it, then the whole thing has to start buffering again as it reverts to 480p.. 
So, I was wondering if anybody knows a way how I can get it sorted so it automatically selects 480 from the get go, so my demand for instant gratification is met!
I'll offer a premature, if enthusiastic (as in so many other things, how very droll) cheers! and also, you look wonderful today, no, you really do! its true!",gaygeek
