<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pact_Magic"> Pact Magic </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cantrips">Cantrips</span></h3>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock_Spells" title="Warlock Spells">warlock spell list</a>. You learn additional warlock Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Slots">Spell Slots</span></h3>
<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
</p><p><b>Spell Attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Focus">Spellcasting Focus</span></h3>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eldritch_Invocations"> Eldritch Invocations </span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pact_Boon"> Pact Boon </span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pact_of_the_Chain">Pact of the Chain</span></h3>
<p>You learn the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Find_Familiar" title="Find Familiar">Find Familiar</a> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pact_of_the_Blade">Pact of the Blade</span></h3>
<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extra-dimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extra-dimensional space when the bond breaks.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pact_of_the_Tome">Pact of the Tome</span></h3>
<p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ability_Score_Improvement"> Ability Score Improvement </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mystic_Arcanum"> Mystic Arcanum </span></h2>
<p>At 11th level, choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as an arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Eldritch_Master"> Eldritch Master </span></h2>
<p>At 20th level, you can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

<p>Starting at 1st level, as an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throw are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dark_Delirium">Dark Delirium</span></h3>

On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
</p><p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.
</p><p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing_Light">Healing Light</span></h3>

</p><p>As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bonus_Proficiency">Bonus Proficiency</span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with hacking tools.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information_Surge">Information Surge</span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, as an action, you can target a computerized device within 30 feet of you. If the targeted device is held or otherwise actively used by a living creature, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the targeted device cease to function until the end of your next turn. If the targeted device is not held or used by a creature, the DM makes a special saving throw for the device with disadvantage and a +0 modifier. Certain shielded devices might negate the disadvantage, at the DM's determination. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wire_Walk">Wire Walk</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can touch a device or socket connected to a hardwired network and teleport along this network to another device or socket within your line of sight. Once you use this feature, you can't  use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_Encryption">Personal Encryption</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws against scrying, thought detection, or any other method of magically learning your whereabouts or reading your thoughts. For any such effect that does not  grant you a saving throw but which requires the creature targeting you to make an ability check, the check is made with disadvantage.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technovirus">Technovirus</span></h3>
<p>At 14th level, you can use an action to make a melee attack against a humanoid creature using your spell attack modifier. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC as a techno organic virus quickly spreads through its body. On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, if the target fails the saving throw, you can use an action to issue it a single command, as if you were casting the command spell. The target makes its saving throw against your command with disadvantage. You can issue this command at any time while the target remains infected. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, at which point the target is cured of the technovirus. The infection can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell.

<p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
</p><p>Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hexblade.27s_Curse">Hexblade's Curse</span></h3>

</p>
<ul><li> You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
</li><li> Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
</li><li> If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Armor_of_Hexes">Armor of Hexes</span></h3>
<p>At 10th level, if the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Master_of_Hexes">Master of Hexes</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when the creature cursed by your Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.
