"Hi everyone, We've continued to see a heavy influx of conversations revolving around today's hero balance updates impacting Mercy. In an effort to consolidate feedback and create a consistent location for users to share their impressions or opinions, please use this thread. MercyValkyrieNo longer makes Resurrect instantNo longer grants a bonus Resurrect chargeThe speed bonus Guardian Angel receives when activating Valkyrie has been decreased by 50%Duration reduced from 20 seconds to 15 secondsDeveloper Comments: Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her, but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes. Additionally, we’re toning back the amount of mobility Valkyrie provides through Guardian Angel and reducing its duration to overall reduce the power of this ability.We appreciate your feedback, as it will assist us and provide insight on improving your Overwatch experience.

We recognize that people were having fun with the exploit but it caused server instability and negatively impacted other players which is why we have removed it. We really want to bring functionality like this to Overwatch and we’re doing research now into how we can support these custom game settings.

"Hi everyone, We wanted to take some time to explain the recent movement changes in depth (with examples). Hopefully this will help everyone better understand what changed, and what did not.Incline Changes:There were two persistent issues with movement on inclines that we wanted to clean up.First, while moving diagonally on inclines you would end up being slightly strafed left or right even if you were only attempting to move forward. This can be a subtle source of aiming issues for many people, and now the player will properly move forward in this situation.  Second, movement up and down inclines had inconsistent speed as compared to the ground. Running both up and down an incline would be faster than walking on flat ground.  However faster movement (e.g. McCree’s Combat Roll) would be slower when going up and down inclines. Having consistent character movement speed is important for many reasons, the biggest of which is it allows you to be able to reliably know how to aim your hitscan shots or lead your projectile fire.Acceleration changes:The characters in Overwatch have a fixed acceleration (how fast they can change their movement velocity) depending on if they are in the air or on the ground.  Previously, this amount would get reduced if you were attempting to change your direction by 90 degrees or less, and was more pronounced if you were going faster than normal (e.g. Winston’s Jump Pack or Doomfist’s Rocket Punch). One of the consequences of this was that if you were in the air travelling forward and wanted to move directly right, you could reach full speed to the right faster if you accelerated backwards to a full stop and then moved to the right, as opposed to simply pressing to the right. Having to do a non-intuitive movement to reach your desired direction as fast as possible is less than ideal, so we made a change to allow you to more consistently use the air acceleration you already had to reach the direction you'd like to be moving in.The new acceleration can feel like momentum is no longer conserved like before, but the forward velocity is just more efficiently being converted into sideways velocity. The direction is changing faster but your overall speed isn’t being slowed down.  Examples: If you're flying as Pharah, you can now just press forward and you will properly accelerate moving forward, instead of having to counter accelerate to stop sideways drift. If you’re leaping as Winston, you can more effectively redirect your velocity around corners. Prior to this rework it was possible to achieve similar mid-air turns by always facing your current velocity while strafing, but this was also unintuitive.You can now press forward and right directional inputs after a Winston leap and you will actually move some to the right, whereas previously you would have to only hold right if you wanted to get any acceleration to the right.It does mean getting used to the new strafing power. No longer do you have to hold strafe for a long time to get a small adjustment to your movement, you can simply short hold or tap it as needed, and pressing forward with a left or right command will do smaller adjustments than if pressing left or right alone.This does not substantially affect movement when trying to change movement direction by >90 degrees.Additionally, left and right strafing on the ground and air will be the same along with attempting to accelerate against a knockback will be the same.We’re keeping an eye on these changes to make sure everything is working correctly. Any feedback would be appreciated, and would be especially helpful with any screenshots or videos.","

"Hmm, so it doesn't sound like it's too impactful for heroes just jumping up and down to avoid being shot, which is good. Don't think people would accept a Genji buff, as he primarily goes left-right-left-right during battles, and that's >90.","

Possibly if players wished to do something other than 2/2/2 they could select other options like 1/3/2.This system seems to work in other role/class based games and I feel like it would greatly decrease toxicity and encourage players to play other roles (DPS would probably have a slightly longer que).Im posting this idea to receave feedback and possibly be noticed.","

"- His play style favors pushing a team around them, her's is about making a   blockade around her.  I.E. He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.  Orisa shield 900 health, CD.Both have their purposes and usage, so I see both as interchangeable depending on the team needs and situations.","

"i stopped playing Comp when your SR effects your QP match making. I noticed that smurff accounts with almost NO gametime are winding up on QP, with an SR rating similar to mine. I made the motion to STOP climbing with my SR because of my direct feelings of Discrimination in Comp. Comp is very ""grey"" in color with no diversity. I thought this game was about diversity, comp does NOT reflect these same values that blizzard states they are about. I watched on youtube,  their Director of game design and their voice actor hiring person talk about diversity in this game and how important it was to blizzard. However since Comp does not respect this business model. I have silently protested this season for this reason.The other reason is, we are given SR only based upon w/L, which means are outcome has been pre-determined by blizzard, BEFORE we started the game. I should be awarded for efforts, NOT win/Loss. I don't know of ANY game out there, other than overwatch that does this.For example: Blizzard determines the best team for you to match with, the player skill rating for them is good. However 2 or 3 of these randomly at will, these players decide that spending 90% of the time T-bagging someone in the comp-match is a better use of their time. Guess what, you just lost the game and not because you chose to. No matter how hard you played, those 2 or 3 players that are bagging around, have costed you, your game! ""so report them"". Yeah thats great, they get banned, I still get the loss and the penalty.","

That being said, it's not always easy to get others online to play with you as everyone has different schedules and ect. There's apps and stuff online that you can use to find others to play with as a team. If that's not up your alley though, then just try the best your can.

"02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonHi, I'm here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a player can have: Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little, and it seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Throughout the entire Christmas Event, I kept trying to get some new skins that I liked (Like Hanzos and Soldiers) but in the end, I got ALL the Voicelines, sprays, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes (Except Orisas). No new skins at all.02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonit seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Same happened in the Summer Games ;-;","

"02/20/2018 10:08 AMPosted by Akigokubut isnt it the flankers job to kill the supports??More like deal with supports; not be easy kills.Why I prefer the Medic from TF2. His weapon wasn't the strongest, BUT could still punish bad plays on people trying to flank (Mostly Scout)This game, the flanker characters have so many escapes and tools to make the fight THEIRS that it's insane to me to think that any support should have such weak self defense tools.If you engage on a Moira in an enclosed space, you should die.If you engage on an Ana with both cooldowns up, you should die. But that isn't the case in this game. Support characters should feel powerful and impactful; they're the ones who HAVE to hold the team up. The Medic felt that way; while not a huge killing machine, he was both a game changer AND able to defend himself when needed. The Übercharge was the most powerful ability in the game, it defined the competitive meta.Soon as a support is deemed too meta defining, they're nerfed and nerfed.Yeah, some of the nerfs WERE needed (Ana's Grenade, Mercy's res issues) but then are left weaker and unfun until the next Witch Hunt begins.Where's the Witch Hunt for Tracer? She has almost always been the BEST pick for DPS unless of a cheesy strat (Bayblade or Pirate Ship) or another DPS was just buffed too much (Mei's ult charge, 76's 20 damage, McSniper, etc.). She is in almost every single competitive game, and in 79% of OWL. I get it, high skill high reward; except what about Ana? She has arguably a much higher skill floor than Tracer, yet has been the worst support since March 21st of last year.","

"Not having fun playing against this heroe because:A)	His normal attack has too much range and his ball does too much damage.B)	His mines in combination with his ball attack does too much burst damage.C)	His Ult Riptire has too much HP and his Ult in general can be performed with little harm to the player.  Just hide.For point A. I think that he should be good at primarily close quarter damage.  I don’t see the need for him to be able to spam his ball attacks from super far away.  Furthermore, I think the ball attack must make contact with the enemy before doing any type of damage, so no splash damage.  For point B. there is not much you can do if Junkrat got you with one hit, his mines will finish you off.  My suggestion would be to change the effects of his mines from doing damage to doing movement displacement like Pharas knockback rocket. For point C. Not every hero can take out the Riptire on their own, it requires incredible reaction and precision for what this ult can do.  Furthermore, it has very small weaknesses that a good player can remove with proper positioning and movement.  I would suggest reducing the HP of the Riptire and making it so that is slows down after each second time spend running.   Alternatively, the Riptire can be made to follow a straight path like Hanzo’s ult and be detonated at the users request.These are my opinions, I know I am not high ranked and I don’t know everything about this game. I just proving my feedback from my ranks perspective.  It is not fun for me and my friends to play against a player that know how to abuse this hero’s abilities. It takes too much effort to take him out from certain hero’s perspectives.   Thank you for reading and have a nice day.","

"Generally, fighting and losing against enemy isn't fun. Though from what you describe, its more on your tanks needing to switch to D.Va to create space for them to move about and deal with Junkrat or adopting their methods in response to Junkrat.Though on the opposite side, I'm also pretty darn sick of seeing Winston/Zarya and D.Va combo whenever I run Junkrat simply because of how well they can shut a Junkrat down. I can also tell you that I absolutely despise tracer, genji, winston and D.va simply because of how little you can do against that comp.Junkrat has weaknesses, its really up to you and your team to adopt against it. If you want to win(If that's how you have fun.), then either you or your friend has to step up.","

That is not Junkrat's fault however. It's just that he can get a lot more value when people just let him do his thing. Wich at our rank is the case way to often.It's a shame that blizzard doesn't reward people for counter picking, and doesn't punish getting destroyed by one of your counters in some way.

"Edit: Since Symmetra has now been addressed, I have updated the section about QoL adjustments with discussion within the megathread to make it easier for the developer team to read.This is extremely long, but I want to illustrate Symmetras problems and how to fix them, hopefully to enlighten the devs on how to fix her. There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Overwatch&utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]Discussion consolidated:These are the biggest things that needed to be addressed according to the megathread.Defensive assists for shield gen, as well as the ultimate voiceline ""flashing"" the ultimate location and radius to teammates for 5 seconds.More assists in general for Symmetra, perception of teamplay is just as big of an issue as how much is within her kit. Offensive assists could possibly be added to teleporter (while the visual effect is active on teammates) as well as turrets.Photon barrier is a handicapped supportive utility compared to other support utility that is meant to protect. Most things will spawn past it when you use it (roadhog hooks, flashbang) and you can't really aim it on teammates. Please look at improving it.Her ultimates incentivize her to play alone and practice nesting rather than play with her team, please give her more options for teamplay in the actual kit. Her killing potential is strong, so this should be a minor utility that can compete with healing without being as strong as healing as to not raise her winrate but make her ""feel"" better in a team game. People have suggested everything from an opposite of discord, to decaying shields, to reworking photon barrier so that it can supply decaying shields to teammates with a lower cooldown (either passing through, or activation like orisas ultimate)Teamplay is her biggest issue, by far. Her killing potential is decent for a dps offsupport. Number adjustments may make her too strong at lower tiers where she is considered better balanced.","

"(reserving this post to edit in other suggestions from the community, not the point of this thread, but here to voice any suggestions)FIRST OFF: I want to caution that reworking ideas are not the point behind this thread. More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools.","

"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact.","

"To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs.","
							 (Edited)

"Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect.","

"Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team.","

"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die.","

"Seriously, you guys need to lay off the Symm change ideas.. especially a lot of this complete reworks.  Symm is near perfect the way she is.. it is the community toxicity and the lack of use in the pro scene that holds her back.The pros don’t use her because she take a lot of practice and committment to the hero and lets face it.. the top pros would rather practice on skills that are easily transferable to other heroes, then practice a hero (like mercy who before she became a reworked OP mess— remember she was NU in pro play before her rework) who has a unique playstyle to use at a high level.  She could use some tweeks to help at higher level.. like making her ult silent.. or turret deployment improvements.. but anything else would make her way too dominate at the lower levels.","

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest.","

"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754867190#post-1I made a post about this in May and trying to bring it back now.Saying sym is a no skill hero is fukin stupid if people dont play her. People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad.","

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :(","

"I feel like for her Photon Barrier, it could get the Orisa treatment, just make it curvier to the sides so it can help block damage.Just curious OP, what do you think of this? Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility.","

Finally, she has a reload time.

So apparently players of my skill level are players with SR 200 or more above me, always on the enemy team. My team are actual similar skill level and often times lower. Yeah sure you could just say ""get gud"" I'd love to but it's really hard to ""get gud"" when these games are so one sided there's no way for me to possibly improve when my team is just rolled over every time. And in the rare case that I get all the high skill level players on my team, there's again no way for me to improve when my team just rolls over the enemy with little to no effort.I don't mind one tricks, I can deal with smurfs, but when I'm losing because the game itself has terrible matchmaking pitting one low to average skill team against a high skill team, it really demotivates me from playing.I used to say ""I don't think I'll ever want to stop playing this game."" I mean heck look at my level I'm level 1294 currently almost at my second gold star. I clearly put a lot of time into this game and loved it. But recently this matchmaking has been getting worse and worse, and I'm finding myself playing this game much less than half the time that I used to. I miss having good and even games, having close games that go into overtime, and awesome team fights. But now it seems that games just last 1-2 minutes because one team just rolls over the other. Or max time because one team can't even push past the first choke. Sorry for this ranty post, you can ignore it, downvote it or whatever, I just needed to vent about this. I'm probably still going to play the game but likely just stick around for just events, and very few times in between. Until matchmaking actually makes fair games, I just can't have fun with this game anymore.","

"Because I'm genuinely getting sick of being backfilled into games that are already on the results screen and not even getting that tiny amount of backfill XP for it.https://i.imgur.com/iKePUfK.jpgI soloq a lot, so the matchmaker seems to prioritize me for backfill. Don't get me wrong, I understand why the matchmaker needs to do this, but so many games, I'll join and instantly be faced with a DEFEAT screen before I've even had a chance to lock in my hero.I understand the very nature of the matchmaker will stop this issue from ever being 100% solved, but here's a few simple changes I propose to reduce the impact and make matchmaking far less stressful:1) Do not allow backfill during overtime, unless it's an ad hoc connection (a player actively choosing to join that specific game from the menu) or the player is already spectating and waiting for a slot. Let's be real, the odds of you being able to change anything in a 5v6 overtime are slim to none, about as high as the odds of you backfilling onto the winning team during that time.2) Give me more than a few hundred extra XP. I don't know what, maybe you could double my base XP during my next game, then maybe I won't get as frustrated when I do end up in these games.3) Put a cooldown between how frequently an individual can be backfilled. The amount of time I spend in queue jumping from endscreen to endscreen because the matchmaker repeatedly backfills me into impossible scenarios is directly impacting the amount of time I'm able to play. It would be nice if whenever I finish a backfill match, there was say, an hour during which time the game would lower or completely eliminate my odds of being backfilled.I'm not asking for a matchmaker overhaul, I'm asking to be able to play the game without getting salty before I've had a chance to play.","

"Mercy 1.0 was fun, but actually only a little less underpowered then she is now.  The reason why: Mercy had no abilities in her base kit that let her actively participate in the fight.  This railroaded Mercy players into basing their entire playstyle around the only active ability Mercy had: her ult, mass rez.Adressing hide n rez: this tactic came down to two sources - SR abusers and people who went waaay out of their way to hide in buildings, rooms below the point, and generally areas that took a while to get to (but was still in range of rez, since it didn't require LoS).  The SR abuse problem has been retroactiely solved with the removal of preformance based SR in diamond and above, and a LoS restriction would force Mercy to put herself out in the open to rez (giving enemies a chance to cc/kill her and eliminating the hide-and-seek minigame).  And one last thing: most Mercy players hated doing hide and rez - it was THEIR TEAMMATES who demanded it, and got toxic if the Mercy didn't.  The standard playstyle of Mercy is to stay with your team as long as possible, only ducking into cover if your team is taking more damage than you can heal/if you see an ult wipe incoming.I don't want to go back to a version of Mercy that doesn't have the GA bunnyhop, but I also hate rez on E with a passion and don't even consider Valkyrie to be an ultimate.  The best solution (to me) seems to be putting a balanced version of Mass Rez on Q, and figuring out an E ability that incentivises Mercy to stay with her team and use it to directly participate in the fight.","

Hide-and-go-Res wasn't LoS abuse.  Far, far from it.  It was where unskilled Mercy players would basically only play with their teams until they got ult, then they would hide away in some corner of the map far away from the teamfight.  They would probably instruct their team to all die on point, then wait for everyone to die before swooping in virtually uncontested for a huge res.  They did this to boost themselves into high ranks, because Performace SR rewarded players who performed more huge reses.I'm well aware of the predominant Mercy strategy to hide when enemy ults come.  The best Mercies I played with Tempo-resed all of the time.  But that doesn't change that poor Mercies were abusing SR gain from huge res by hiding regardless of the situation.And no, it wasn't retroactively solved by only removing performance-based SR in the highest ranks.  It will need to be removed across all ranks for Hide-and-Res to become less of an issue.  Want to know why?

"OH i enjoyed Mass Rez, except when the enemy teams' mercy popped out of nowhere on a Team kill and screamed her infamous lines in German, for resurrecting the whole team on the Payload and having them finish the fight. It did make mercy the wildcard in the game, because if you didn't kill mercy or find her in time, she re-started the fight. I look at this from both aspects: Positive and negative. I think the fight dynamics were most interesting before the single target rez and Valkyrie.Valkyrie though, has opened up a box of snakes. It encourages battle mercy. The community HATES this, but battle mercy IS fun this way. I just hit Valkyrie, yes the team is spamming I am ""Prick thrower"" for not healing. but I just mowed down the entire enemy team with a pistol. As for Widow VS Valkyrie mercy, its gg for widow. Even with well-placed headshots, mercy is still going strong. Valkyrie allows for Revenge kills with mercy, she can fly around anywhere and go after the player she has a grudge against.","

I only hope Blizzard would actually succeed and fix it.And this is coming from a big fan of new heroes. While new heroes do affect the rest of the game like change the meta, the broken/bad stuff we currently have is ruining the fun.A few things I can remember right now is when you disconnect 1 second before the match ends, even if you win you will receive a defeat and -50 SR. If the server dies and you get kicked, defeat and -50 SR. Disconnect, come back 10 seconds after and win the match? Defeat and -50 SR.  It takes months and months to make a simple change to a hero. Took 2 years to fix a Mei bug. Competitive is a mess, it's random, a lot of the times you can't play what you want unless you disregard what the team needs, and lots of people who play Competitive completely disregarding what the team needs.It's not fun when 95% of effort gets put into new content and 5% into existing content.","

"For one, even a decent Widowmaker requires a lot of mechanical skill, which is rather noteworthy. Someone who can track well with a sniper is most likely going to be a major asset to the team and cripple the enemy when played right.Also, Widowmaker has a lot of weaknesses in close quarters, hence her need to stay away from the brunt of the fight. I get that it sucks to be one-shot (a legitimate one-shot, not just multiple damage sources in short time-frame), but there are strengths and weaknesses to each character. Do remember that she is a Defense hero: she specializes in zoning areas. Having the possibility of being one-shot or losing a major amount of health is usually enough to encourage shields, strafing, or just outright avoiding the area.You gotta choose your battles.","

"The best course of action is to be mindful of the info you're given. Once the match starts you can check to see who's on the opposing team, and there will be audio queues from your character and/teammates letting you know there's a sniper. If you do get killed, watch the kill cam. It'll let you know where they're hiding, and you can plan accordingly.","

"Stream Sniping:  It's an intentional act to try to queue and get placed in the same game/match as the Streamer with the intention of ruining the Streamer's game/stream.  For example, Timthetatman was targeted by that stream sniper who would either get on his team, and throw.  Or be on the enemy team and would target Timthetatman over everyone else.

Not to mention another ape-based hero would be SOOOO underwhelming. I can hear the giant sigh of disappointment in the player base already. Every character that has been introduced is always different than the last. I expect the trend to continue.","

02/20/2018 11:04 AMPosted by Meowcenaryhttps://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Jetpack_CatLikely never gonna happen tho unfortunately. The idea was scrappedSuch a missed opportunity if they dont make it so. The reasons Jeff gave just dont sell it to me. He said the idea of a flying cat was too outlandish even for Overwatch but we have a talking scientist gorilla...he also said they ran into trouble designing the paws to work with the jetpack controls but I feel D Va's in-mech view is exactly this. So...why the difficulty? He said it was a scrapped idea but I would not be surprised if it was a hint of things to come. I just dont see it not being feasible and another animal hero would be a pretty bad !@# addition to the roster.,"

"Ok I was thinking a while back: What if jetpack cat was in the game. How would you make a cat with a jetpack a fighter? This is my take on it:Name: JetCat (because jetpack cat may be to long for the character select screen)Class: DefensePrimary Fire: 50 Damage ScratchSecondary Fire: Opens Up a Scope, Shots do 90 Damage a hit. Scope has a laser sight showing where the shots will go. Special frequency of light that only cat eyes can see.Ability 1:Tangle: Places A hairball on the ground in front of them. Anyone who walks through them will be slowed to 50% speed and mobility abilities are reduced by 50%. Can have 5 out at a time, must wait 5 seconds before placing another one. Does not stack with other hairball.Second Ability: Prowl: Jetpack Cat Becomes invisible all except for its eyes, similiar to a cat in the dark, for 5 seconds. Can shoot while invisible. 8 Second cooldown.Ultimate: Flight: JetCat's jetpack flies off and can either attach to an ally, who then gains control and can use it however, or can attach to an enemy and carry cool down.Thoughts?","

"Coming up with ideas of how it would work is the easy part. He/she could be a flying character similar to Pharah but without as much up-time (somewhere in between DVa's boosters and Pharah's hover). Maybe a hit-scan flyer but with slow mobility while airborne but when on the ground much faster however a different weapon, ability is used.","

"D.Va's accuracy is really not that important. For lots of heroes it isn't since there are a ton of factors that can inflate/deflate it. My D.Va accuracy probably hovers around 20%. She has lots of spread and a lot of her time shooting is spent just poking at enemies, so you cannot expect it to be too high. As for tips, try to find a nice medium between offensive and defensive with her. Only peel off for enemies who are all alone and you know you can get without your mech being destroyed. By and large you want to stay with your team. D.Va is not indestructable and her biggest weakness is how easy it is to melt her mech, so you must work around this weakness. D.Va's mobility and tankiness isn't to charge into the enemy team and try to assassinate an enemy while their entire team is around. You have to punish out of position enemies and go pick off the flankers. Having a high sensitivity isn't important and you need to find the sens you are most comfortable with. Sensitivity is all about preference so if you're having a hard time tracking enemies, I'd consider lowering it! Mine on console is just 65/65 and I find it works great for me tbh.","

I try to emulate the Dvas who get kills by launching it into the air but can never seem to get anyone with them unless they are stunned by other ults.For the bombs I would suggest working on sliding the bombs off of walls/objects. Those will be the sneakiest bombs since they get caught on the wall for a second until they slide out into the open and explode. Shooting the bomb off into the air at an angle also works well for me. I have little luck shooting it straight up into the air (it's just so predictable and differing sky boxes means where the bomb ends up detonating isn't consistent since it may hit the sky box or may not) and I would suggest you never ult to salvage your mech except for in the rare cases you /know/ your team can still win the fight and having you will help. Your best bet is to go into custom games and check out the best walls to slide your bomb off of (watch out because it can get stuck on some!)","

					",,,,,,,
One of D.Va's biggest asset is her mobility. Jump in and out of fights and punish when you see opportunities. When your team is pushing use her to create space. When you're under fire always try to show your back to minimize damage. Mastering this will make your DVa a lot more durable. Mix that with your DM too ofc.Always focus on the high priority targets or the ones that D.Va easily kills in a single rush missile combo.,"

"Tips for Dva, her DM should be saved for eating orbs and enemy ults.  You really shouldn't be using it to ""tank"".  Its more of gobble ults and occasionally protect allies out of position or allies pulled by hog.  You can also use DM when you are diving in on the enemy.  Dva is meant to be played aggressively, when you see an opportunity to dive on an enemy support do so.  Dive at them rocket in their face while shooting them and then melee.  They are typically dead with this combo.","

"This would cause more problems than it solves. People would click the category with the shortest wait time then play what they want anyways (invalidating the entire system). If you force them to play the role they select then DPS would have insane wait times. You'd also open the doors for throwers to pick support and just troll DPS players who waited ten minutes for a match (And giving a fast-lane for griefers). You'd also run into the issue of DPS players unable to hit Pharah due to no experience on Hitscan. But if you have supports who can, the system wont let them swap mid game. That is of course you allow a system to bypass the initial system... which then defeats the purpose of the role select system from the get go.","

I solo que.Not to mention I CAN play other heroes and so could most people on my team. Being a one trick is playing one sole HERO not one sole role. It's just that we all had all of OUR hours on support except for me and the tank guy. Also I'm a tank AND support main. -_-I just call myself a support main because people call me that even though I play more hours on tank than I want to.And last I checked you don't have to be great at every hero in the game. There are a ton of players that climbed with only 3 to 4 heroes (I can play 7 hereos comfortably). Plus I dont like being dps, I like having large health pools and being able to heal myself before anyone else.  I could go into detail on why I don't like playing most dps heroes in Overwatch but it's really just down to none of them have a playstyle that I've liked so far. Oh I can play dps. I'm just not consistent. Sometimes I do really well and other times I'm just there to feed the enemy. Not to mention in every game people instalock dps. And I only play comp. If I were to play dps in comp people would report me for throwing because they see my hours aren't on dps. I can't play quick play because it's boring to me. I guess I could Smurf and instalock dps on a second account, otherwise it really wouldn't be wise for me to practice in comp. Plus don't forget the fact that I would be hella bored playing characters I don't want to play. I didn't have this problem playing Paladins. At least in that game there were about 3 champions in every role that I liked and was really good at. Tyra, Viktor, Lian...Ruckus, Fernando, Torvald...Seris, Ying, Jenos...Can't wait for a ""then go back to Paladins"" comment.I don't know why I'm so different in Overwatch. I guess no matter how similar the characters seemed on paper, in actuality they play very differently.","

At least when a genji or tracer steals my kills they have to be somewhat aware of the situation unfolding and have the cognitive ability to either aim their cursor or press swift strike and most importantly of all the person they are killing is actually on their screen. Moira on the other hand doesn't even need to be at their keyboard and that isn't an exaggeration. You can fire the orb in a random direction,get up and go get a drink and come back to multiple kills.","

"One, five-stacks become impossible.Two, this leads to extremely long queue times and higher chances of imbalanced matches for anyone not solo queueing. In fact, as of now, there's quite a few people who regularly play in groups that think there's a bias against them, which is that the matchmaker will assume groups are stronger, and find more skilled solo-queue opponents to make up for the assumed difference if it can't find a more equally sized and skilled group.And this is longer queue times for everyone, mind you, regardless if it's solo queue or not.Unless a whole new competitive system is introduced (hi, guild system?), this just can't feasibly happen for every single match. Solo queuers are the easiest to get into games and fill into matches, removing them and putting them into their own queue just can't work without ruining the experience of the other half. Right now, you just have to enter the games knowing you're always at the risk of being placed into or against stacked teams -- but the matchmaker considers that already, so, you know, this just feels like one more excuse to say ""the game made me lose, change the game for me."" No offense.","

"Agree / Signed.1. Solo (1/1/1/1/1/1)2. Mix It Up (2/2/2 or 4/2 or 3/3)3. Full (6)No 5/1 unless you check ""will fill"" which would allow any of the current combos. If you are in a duo and check ""allow fill"" you can be teamed with solos. Otherwise, you're with other small groups.The ""versus"" would have a different metric, similar to what it is now. Solos won't go against 6-stacks, but might go up against Mixed Stacks. You don't get to choose your opponents.This, along with an ""avoid joining team with this player"" will affect your queue time. That's OK if that's what you want.For 6 stacks, allow an alternate player in the case of disconnects. This player must be in the group (which means that groups can actually be larger than 6) and the team sorts out who is in the game during the load time. If you don't choose in time, it's random. The 7th player spectates. He can't be ""tagged in"" though... if someone leaves, they can't come back, and they get the leaving penalty. This could only be done for groups though. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't sign up for a fill unless I really trusted my team. And if you allow a troll on your team who comes in and throws, that's on you, and only affects people who willingly grouped up together.","

"What has been one or some of your funniest moments in Overwatch so far, whether it be in Training, Skirmish, Competitive, Quick Play, or Custom? One funny moment I had, I think I was 76. We were attacking in Hollywood, and the defending team was spawn-killing us and the match was 3/4 over and we were losing. Somehow I managed to dash past everybody by going through the building on the left outside the attack spawn point (ran down the stairs, through the archway past their Reinhardt, and went behind the building next to the point), and was literally just crouching behind the car on the point the whole time, captured about 90% before they figured out someone was on point and they all came after me and killed me. That was amusing. We did win in the end, because of that. ;)Another funny moment was during the Army of One brawl, in Skirmish.

Instead I landed in this little crevice in the rocks. I couldn’t get back up without someone to fly to with Guardian Angel. I couldn’t climb or jump over the rocks to fall, die and respawn. So I’m in this stupid friggin’ grotto on Illios, and all I hear from my team is “I NEED HEALING!”So (having no mic) I start spamming the text chat.  “Help! I’m stuck down a hole! I can’t get out!”  And I take Mercy’s pistol and start shooting into the sky, in bursts of three, the universal signal for “I’m in the sh*t” in gun language, hoping to lead one of my teammates to me.So I hear footsteps above me, and soon friendly Widowmaker falls past me and dies, bless her heart for trying. Another minute goes by and I hear Sombra’s “Hello!”  And I finally look up, and there’s my friendly Sombra looking over the edge down at me, waving hello.So I was finally able to use her to GA out of the hole, and she and I both died about 2 seconds later by enemy Roadhog.

I think they were just as shocked as me that no death blossom was forethcoming as we all know what it means when you see a Reaper jump down behind your team. I couldn't figure out what happened until I saw my Ultimate guage with the number 98%.Time slowed down and we must have stared for at least a few seconds. Then we remembered that we were playing Overwatch and on different teams.

It will be like Reddit and how they can control things. So basically if you get down voted a ton of times your going to have a higher restriction on how many times you post and what your post are allowdd to have.Posted a few times on a subreddit for hunters x hunter and the reddittors downvoted it to hell(I forget what post I was probably oblivious to information) I have a 10 minute restriction for post.

"I truly and honestly believe Blizzard is getting their act together. They revamped the report system., They made the rules clear, they've made a point out of 2 popular streams for false reporting one tricks, and Jeff himself has said on the forums that throwing is reportable and one tricking is not, and that reporting one tricks is bannable.While there's definitely room for this implementation of silenced users not being able to post on the forums to be dangerous, account silences are never permanent the first time. So if it happens once you will most definitely get to speak up when the chat ban runs out. if it happens again, well.... Idk man I can only say it's most likely your own fault.And there's always blizzard customer support (like actually contacting them instead of just responding with a ticket)","

I'm glad Blizzard has the pro games. It makes it easier to spot the cheaters. I'm just supposed to believe that 1 out ever 100 players just happens to be better than any pro I've ever seen. And they all happen to play quick play instead of competitive? (only saw one super absurd aim player in comp). Blizzard needs to do a better job of finding and banning these players. It's not enjoyable to both play against and with these people.,"

"(WARNING: LONG RANT) So I’m having a nice game in Junkertown on Quickplay right? Minding my own business as Tracer, and our team is really dominating. Like we managed to push it from the beginning to the second point without being stopped. So in my head I’m thinking, “Yes! I might actually get a bunch of free XP!” since it’s really hard to get when solo queuing like I’m left to do 99% of the time I play Overwatch. Then suddenly I see a Reinstancing sign at the top of the screen because 3 enemy teammates left. And just like that I’m kicked from the match I was in. WHY? Just because my team was winning and some salty players left? I get it, they left and gave the enemy team a disadvantage. But that’s why you’re already forcing people to be backfills for games like these. So why, why do I and the rest of my teammates have to get cheated out for our hard work? It’s just so frustrating to have to lose XP like that, especially when it means I’m closer to another Lunar Event Loot Box. Sorry for the long rant.","

"Honestly there's probably some fun psychology behind what types of personalities gravitate towards particular hero types.But in general, I'd imagine tanks really want team play, so they're people who often want to succeed and enjoy multiplayer games the most.By contrast, and I'm not !@#$ting on DPS, a lot of FPS games do not require any teamwork and you can just lone-ranger your way through it. Some people just want all the kills, all the damage, and don't want to protect healers, tanks, divers.

Absolutely. I play Zenyatta a lot. I rely mostly on tanks for survivability in the game. Especially barrier tanks since I usually got no means of escaping. I've had Zarya's saving me from getting pinned by Reinhardt also hog not getting that shot after hooks.  Sometimes I've had hogs hooking enemy Mccrees after using their flashbang on me or even completely shielding me while taking a breather (thanks to this 50% damage reduction buff). These kinds of players truly understand the awareness of the games. Also being a big hitbox hero also makes you vulnerable.,"

Not to mention a lot of ""healer mains"" are not healers by choice, but because nobody wants to take the role.DPS mains... well, are Dps mains, If they are under-performing or just being countered, they start pointing fingers at each other for not healing or not doing whatever rather than picking another hero or try a different approach. Tanks on the other hand, are somewhat dependent on their team, but can still carry regardless of what the rest of their team are doing. they have the mentality of a support, they know they require their team to be of any use, but are still capable of getting kills themselves, and so, they don't get as frustrated as other players.

"It's because tanks get the least amount of crap from their teammates. Most of the player base has no idea what they do and they aren't willing to do it better so you get less flame for playing tank. Playing on a tank only account VS my main where I play DPS, I get a crazy amount of flame playing DPS. Even if I'm playing poorly on tank, no one will say anything or blame DPS/support.If you consistently treat someone badly, they will act badly. This is why Hanzo mains have the stereotype of being sour, they get flamed on the daily.","

because alot of people who lack aiming skill are playing supports like mercy and moira and if ana becomes balanced (not op or anything just balanced) they would be wrekt therefore blizzard keeps ana underpowered and mercy and moira overpowered.,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"Ana's value is about staying aliveAs the only support without a clear way to stay alive (Healing passive, high damage, or high mobility) she struggles in that sense.Ana's BEST tool is her Grenade; it is also her ONLY tool to heal herself. If you take a stray rocket or explosion for 120 damage, you use your grenade to heal. Yet it leaves you STILL under full health meaning you need to leave the fight for a health pack OR take focus from your other support.Ana is a character that thrives in slower, closer games BUT with how the game has been mobility creeped (Doomfist, Sombra, Moira, Mercy, Widowmaker, Junkrat, new Hanzo*tm*) and how much faster the game is played, Ana doesn't really have a leg to stand on anymore.She has ONE tool that has a 0.5 second delay before it is shot off to defend herself. It has a 12 second cooldown. Every single movement ability has a lower cooldown than that.Ana's ONLY self healing has a 10 second cooldown. Every support has one that is faster and more consistent that CAN'T be blocked. Even Moira, if she can't life steal has her biotic orb that has the same cooldown BUT heals for MORE (Not to mention fade)Ana needs at LEAST a form of healing passive at this point. Buffing her Sleep Dart or BioGrenade are VERY dangerous; they have the potential to be VERY overbearing if they're not kept in check with their restrictions.","
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"It's dumb. You have heroes like Widow, Soldier, McCree who become really powerful if you have the aim. A skilled Ana should absolutely be outperforming other supports.  Moira is at the power level a practised Ana should be at. Moira should be a robust anti-flanker healer who sacrifices output. The balance decisions in this game drive me wild.","

"She has the tools to be the most powerful healer (sleep dart is obviously good if you have the aim for it, and her nade is criminally underrated) what she currently lacks are the passives to take her that step further. She needs a better way to get health back other than wasting her nade on herself, and it's ridiculous that a sniper-healer is best rewarded for basically sticking her rifle up her tanks behinds - she needs to be able to get to better vantage spots faster than walking around up stairs forever. Other than that the current meta just doesn't favor her. Winston is brutal on her with both his attack and his shield, and Tracer annihilates Ana within seconds unless she gets a lucky sleep on her. If we get a tank-heavier meta that relies more on death-ball you will see her more.","

You're trying to tell me she doesn't ?Not at close range. Not at shieldbreak or mobility or self-sustain. She can kill people faster and from farther away, which is huge, but she crumples pretty fast in a brawl and can be pretty hard countered.[Ed: My point, in case it isn't clear, is that even if Ana is buffed (and I think she probably should be), she will always have some drawbacks compared to the ""easier"" supports as a tradeoff for her hugely valuable utility]","

"Low survivability causes heroes to hide before ulting. Why does Reaper hide before ulting? Well, ironically, he can't use shadow step in a fight and not expect to die. Same for Mercy, if Guardian Angel was reliable enough, which it isn't, she hid as an unhealthy exploit, and used res as her ""hehe sorry but I'm back"" button.Same reason McCree is encouraged to hide before using his slow-movement ult? Same reason Pharah has to sneak in Barrage.I GENUINELY don't understand whats confusing.","

"What you fail to understand, is that NOT having a support present, to heal people was the reason for people dying. Back when mercy had mas res, you had 2 options.Either you picked ana or a mercy.If you had ana, she could have kept your team alive, be a part of it and contribute.For mercy, She would hide somewhere. Not heal anyone during that time. Cause everyone to die only for the possibility of mas res which most of the time, was immediately shut down by higher level players. Which is why mercy never saw even the slightest bit of usefulness for grandmaster lvl and above. At least now she's more engaging. She contributes during fights and she doesn't hide somewhere and is actually more viable than before.","

"Yeah, I LOVE the generalization that many, not all, of the DPS mains put out about Mercy. The BAD Mercy players played ""Hide and Rez"", the GOOD ones didn't. Not ALL of the videos on YouTube show Mercy doing Hide and Rez do they?No, they do not. Yet that is what we are ALWAYS accused of. But the Original Post DOES have a point! 1) Reaper, McCree, and often Soldier 76 and Junkrat would hide then pull their Ult to maximize damage to the enemy team.2) Hanzo just shoots through walls with HIS Ult, basically hiding but not quite.3) Tracer can ZIP in, drop her mine, then ZIP back out quickly.4) D.Va can turbo her Meka in for her Ult.I could go on, but you get the general idea. Yet Mercy, due to a few bad players, had her Ult removed and replaced, then nerfed into the ground.Just saying that if any DPS hero had been treated THIS harshly, do to a few rotten apples in the bunch, the game would have already folded up tent and no one would be playing anymore. Yet do this to a Healer, and YEAH we can still kill stuff and play...Ready for the down-votes...","

That is just the way Death Blossom and Shadow Step are designed. Even if Reaper had good mobility (which he doesn't have), you would still hide if you want to pull off a successful Death Blossom.","

I would imagine having 0 hours played as her you wouldn't know how she was used. I had a quintuple rez as Mercy once, defending point A of Temple of Anubis. I heard about two or three Ultimate callouts from the enemy team, so I knew there were going to be a few deaths whether I was trying to heal them or not. So I did the smart thing and hid on the other side of the arch. Sure enough, a couple more enemy Ultimates were sent in and they wiped all five of my teammates, and again, it would not have made a difference if I had been trying to heal them, I just would have died as well.So I waited for all that mess to clear up, swooped in and got the easy 5-rez. We hard held point A because they had burned every single Ultimate they had. It was extra sweet because the team had asked me to swap off Mercy at the start of the round. Boy did they feel stupid.","

Especially given the utter lack of counterplay of 1.0.Lets see, counter-plays to Mercy 1.0 HUmmmmmm? This was BEFORE she was given temporary invulnerability because more than half the time she would die pulling Rez in the first place.1) as always KILL the Mercy by:...A) in the ult ...B) before you pull ult...C) while she is flying in (Widowmaker/Hanzo mains)2) AFTER she pulls her Ult by:... Saving 1 ult to take care of a recently Rezed team. BUT, this took coordination an with one person pulling their Ult, and the other DPS not wanting to be outdone, the other DPS/Tanks would pull their Ults doing all that Showboating.... ummm.. I mean ""Hard work"" to get the POG.You blow 3-5 Ults at the same time, not saving any Ults JUST IN CASE of a Rez, then it is YOUR OWN DANG FAULT and your team should be punished for it.I had this one game, running back from spawn for about the 5th time because my DPS couldn't be bothered to take out the flankers that were targeting me. I come back to where they all are, after 3 people on the enemy team had pulled there Ults at the same time to take out my team. I fly in to the middle of them and pull an absolutely PERFECT 5 man Rez, it was BEAUTIFUL!!! Anyway, everyone knows how small a Tracer bomb is right? This one VERY smart Tracer threw her bomb into the middle of us and my 5 man Rez turned into a 6 man wipe. QUITE DESERVINGLY, the Tracer got PoG. So don't you DARE say there were ""No Counters to Mercy Rez"" because there sure were before, during, AND AFTER.","

I did not say Hiding from your Ult, because getting clear or being clear of it is not hiding. Now you, and other HEAVY killing Ults have one less defense against them. An, quite honestly, many of Mercy 1.0 Rezes were Tempo Rezes of 1 to 3 Heroes, not Huge Rezes of 4-5 Heroes.

"I don't think he's bad but he's such a niche dps compared to the others. Even as a tank buster Bastion is usually just a better pick cause he shreds them faster, can do it from a distance and can break shields. His abilities are also kinda lack luster. Teleport is way to slow, leaves him vulnerable for 2 seconds (also kinda buggy sometimes) and is very map dependent to get value out of, wraith form is okay but kinda one note and easy to play around.Again I don't think he's bad but he could stand to see a little love, maybe make wraith form a bit faster, let him teleport whilst in wraith form, re-work teleport into something a bit more practical.","

Only that people attempted to use it to do that.I avoided a player the day the Overwatch servers went live. In the two months before it was removed I played games against the player I avoided maybe a dozen or so times. I would chat in ALL chat with them before the match started. The person I was playing against did not know I placed them on Avoid Player, and I did so because of game philosophy disagreement, I play to win this person did not. I know each and every time I was against them it was the same person I avoided, and I confirmed that they were still on my list to make sure I had not removed them.The avoid player feature was removed because Blizzard figured out before it was too late, that some players were becoming so bothersome other people did not want to play with them. Eventually these individuals would not find a game in a timely manner. Blizzard admitted that the system was working as intended. I am guessing they just didn't know how well it would intend on working, or how fast it would remove the unwanted from the player pools.","

And tbh, with this restriction why should anyone avoid some awesome player from being on your team at all?2.1) Set the avoid player function on a list of ~30-50 player.This way you can't just avoid anyone for eternity because if there is someone else you want to avoid and your list is full, well then you just remove someone from your list you haven't seen for ages.OR2.2) Set the avoid player list unlimited but remove players automatically after a while (72hrs/1week/1month/1season ) this way you will be able to avoid certain players for a while but they will be ""unavoided"" after the time frame you put them on your list is gone.","

In 13 years playing Blizzard games, and the same amount of time following topics on the forums as well as Blizzard design philosophy. Blizzard has never made a change in any game ever based on the experience of one player. Blizzard has always made decisions based upon how inclusive a change can be. ""Avoid Player"" was an exclusionary option. It allowed you to not have to play with people you did not want to play with. This pretty much goes against everything I have ever seen Blizzard do.I will still defend my opinion. ""Avoid Player"", even with a minor glitch of increasing the queue time of some people unintentionally, was working exactly like it should have. The only people who do not want an Avoid feature are people who would be avoided, and probably are in every facet not just Overwatch.","

I have used controllers before so not super alien to me but for some reason no matter what settings I do on Overwatch the controller just feels bad. I feel like the controller has ""mouse acceleration"" It sometimes moves slow then sometimes moves too fast, and motion blur that can't be disabled makes it even harder. Does anyone know the best optimal settings for Overwatch on PS4 or is it just something I gotta get use too? (Also if there is a way to disable motion blur?

Maybe the motion blur is caused by your tv/monitor? I don't know much about that, so maybe try tweaking the tv's picture settings.","

"Which one do you use most often? Left click:Pros:Better dps at 0.4 sec between shots (2.5 shots per second)You can spam chokes and the battle field to contribute to team damageCons:You stay in line of sightLow burst damage (so you might not get kills)Right click:Pros:You can tuck behind a corner and stay safeBurst damage potential to one shot people and don't allow them to get awayCons:Worse dps at 0.6 sec for each charge (1.666 shots per second)Lower spam potentialBut here's the question: I have been using primarily the left click because of higher DPS. Basically, unless I am being chased or I have a particular target that I want to burst down, I use left click. Typically, I stand a safe distance away discord, harmony and just spam the battle field with left-click, at the head level (okay, I try to predictive but it is hard and I don't think I have the exact mechanical or timing skills for mastery).But I am wondering if this is the best way to do it. So my question is, assume, you are playing Zen at a safe distance and nobody is jumping on you and there is a fight going on in front of you. Do you use left clicks or right clicks?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"left click in the fight. right click for shooting at span, a genji jumping over you, a tracer, anything where you think you can burst someone. some pros have compared right click to scatter(i dont think) but right click is def more powerful than left click, its just left is more consistnt so you have to use it more","

"IMO it depends on how important transcendence is.  If the enemy is running grav-dragon or some other wipe combo, I usually prefer left-clicking their tanks in the fight to build ult faster.  If trance isn't that important, I'm more likely to go for r-click snipes.","

"Interesting opinions. The trans angle is definitely a good point. Left click has higher DPS potential and it is easier to charge up using tanks but even if I have trans, I prominently used to use left clicks. But is the sniping potential of right click that makes it better or the safety offered by being able to charge behind cover? Assume there are no snipers, otherwise, I agree charge shots are definitely better.","

"Left-click for fighting mobile targets.  Also, it's faster to stop shooting to assign Healing and Discord Orbs.Right-click for corner-peek shots, spamming corridors, smashing high HP targets.  Fully charged Right-click corner-peek shots are also good for destroying Torbjorn turrets which can generally shoot Zenyatta down faster than he can destroy it.  But avoid charging shots all the time as Zenyatta is locked in his animation and can't assign his orbs while doing so.","

If you can't kill Moira and she kills you over the course of four seconds, yes, you got outplayed.For reference, Tracer at maximum range can potentially unload 240 damage into a Moira, making the self-heal worthless. While I admit you need near perfect aim to do this, it's not unrealistic given Tracer can negate most of Moira's damage by using 'E', thus potentially prolonging the fight to 10 seconds, giving a much larger margin of error for Tracer's aim.","

More damage, though? That's not true at all. Zenyatta and Symmetra outdamage her by about a mile and a half, and even Mercy can do better damage than her if you can land headshots. And she's no tank, either. She's just as susceptible to burst damage as the other supports are.

She’s best against weak but sustained damage(Sombra, Soldier) but helpless against burst. Can’t outheal a Tracer’s clip to the head, since her pistols fire so fast. Also, all tanks have armor(not Roadhog, but he gets about half his health back when he uses TaB, so there’s that) and Moira doesn’t. I also forgot when exactly they gave her a large tank-sized health pool. She has the best consistent damage, but not the best overall. Zen and Sym melt poorly coordinated teams like butter in an oven, and Mercy’s pistol does more if you can consistently land headshots.","

The lowest dps in the game. If she has her damage orb on a target long enough, she can do 100 dps. Which only puts her above Ana in the support dps department. She then matches Mercy. However, the balancing point then comes between Moira’s soft-lock beam which can’t crit but is consistent and Mercy’s ability to crit which takes more aim. Lucio and Zenyatta our dps Moira. I will say if Moira is flanking to play dps and take out low health heroes - the other team must be makjng some really poor choices.","

"Below are some ideas that the community or myself have requested to the devs, but have never been added to the game. The following changes are sensible and well thought out, be sure to comment your opinions and suggestions as I will be updating this a lot.ChangesSombra Translocator Cancel; Ever been waiting around ages or have to use the teleporter when you could just simply hold E (or another key) to cancel it?In-game Alerts; Picture this, every time you get yourself caught in junkrat's trap, the enemy team gets notified that someone has been trapped- rather than only the junkrat being notified. This makes it so you don't have to shout it out on voice chat, and allows players who don't use voice chat or text to communicate what is happening. This doesn't just stop here; as you can be notified say if- Torb's turret was destroyed. I know that most characters have voice lines which say that something has happend; but for the competitive side it's much more convinent for the average player. This change will allow players to be more cooperative and work as a team to perform combos.Symmetra Shield Health GUI; In a recent patch Winston was given the ability to view his shield's health with a small GUI. This is a nice touch and suits the game as other characters like Reinhardt can view their shield's health. So why is Symmetra left out on this?! OK, sure- maybe it's not as important as Winston's, but it really isn't anything too hard to do and can help in some situations.Heal/Damage Numbers; This could be a toggle on/off option which allows you to show how much healing/damage you are doing. This may be useful for people who want to test stats or change settings in a Custom Game.Extended Sombra Invisiblity; If you read the title, you probably already understand my message im giving you- why does she only get a limited amount of time? You go to chase someone and.. it runs out? Or you become visible when you didn't want to? She's a stealth Hero! Not a visible Hero!More Custom Game Options; And you wonder why no one chooses the Custom Browser which you put on the main page of the gamemodes, if there isn't any settings to change within the game- then its just boring. Sure you added some settings like no gravity, but us creative players we want more options or we can't create that perfect huge roadhog boss battle that we all wanted to make!Clans; Wouldn't it be cool if we could all create a clan, lets say if you have a lot of expirence with the game you can! So like once you reach level 50 or so, or maybe a star (level 101) you can create a clan with a custom profile picture and start adding your friends to it. Sort of like a very minature village.Torbjorn's Hitbox; Nuff said.Detailed Scoreboard; Right now people just say ""4 gold m9 lol im doing GREAT im so pro"", but imagine if you could give players detailed information on how awful they are playing. (im just joking this will lead to more toxic behaviour but it would be cool to view more detailed stats).Changeable Weapons and Skins; Look ok, we all know we want Widow's Cote D'azur skin but at the same time having her Nova Skin's Gun.Updated Hero Information Screen; This hasn't change since the game launched for the old heroes, so this means that new players who follow the video instructions learning how to play Symmetra will try and give people shields by using the E key (second ability).New Training Zone; We all know it hasn't changed since.. well.. the game launched- at all. Look i'm sure Symmetra can use hard light to craft a new Training Zone.Higher Skill Cap To Play Competitive; Tired of getting matched with a guy that only knows how to place a turret as Torbjorn?","

I don't think Sombra needs extended invisibility but tanslocator cancel would be great. Sometime I throw trans to a bad spot it takes forever to get it back,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"The Translocator cancel isn't relevant unless you always put it on a health pack and expect to teleport back to it. Just save your Translocator for when you need it and then throw it, so you can stay in the vicinity of the fight, and don't have to run back and forth while abandoning your team.This is basically the same thing as the Translocator example. You're just using it without considering what you want to use it for.  Set yourself a goal, such as you have to use Stealth to flank around and kill the healer, or you have to use it to chase down Genji trying to go for a health pack. Using Stealth this way means that time won't be a problem at all, because you won't be running aimlessly all over the map.It seems to me like Blizzard is adding new options to custom games with every other update. I really don't see why this is a complaint other then players being impatient.Yes, a guild system is the most requested change in the game. I don't see how anyone can disagree with this.There needs to be a disadvantage to always running around in crouch. A taller target is always going to be easier to hit then a smaller one. Torbjorn can practically hide behind is turret.I don't see this ever happening. The weapon skins are a part of the skins as a whole. The ability to change color scheme on your weapon skin would be more realistic.I don't think a training zone is a big priority for Blizzard, even though it would be nice to have for the hardcore wannabe pros, so they can spend hours shooting dots.Blizzard are improving on the grouping system all the time, they have said this often. It will never be perfect.","

She feels like a Generalist in a Specialists body. She has a lot of different abilities and they don't feel like they line up together with each other. She's a support but really only supports by using her shield SOMETIMES and using her ultimate. (Which in my book isn't enough. You could make Widowmaker a Support for the same reasons. Venom Mine reveals a target that's affected and her ultimate reveals all targets.)She's called a defensive hero because she has the DPS for it AND she has defensive capabilities.I know you said the roles were ""guidelines"" but I truly wanna know what direction you aim to take Symmetra in.","

She is a jack if all trades, and that's not a bad thing.Sym can fill in the gaps in poor team comps e.g. Low of tanks? Sym can block damage and create space. Low on healing?

"I agree with ShinyPants, she actually has a lot of utility, it's a shame that people don't realize that. I play symmetra quite a bit, and I'd say she is actually a viable pick in many cases, both on attack and defense. She is a high risk though, when played good she can delete whole teams and carry the game, but also when properly countered she can be completely useless.The biggest problem with symmetra is that people don't know what to do with her and how to use her. She has a very odd design, unlike any FPS character, and in the meantime has developed a reputation of being somewhat of a troll pick. I get regularly harassed for playing her in comp before we even leave the spawn room. It's a shame, I really find her fun to play, precisely because she's not you typical CoD character. It was this fact, that OW is not like every other shooter out there, that has drawn me to it in the first place.","

"The game is balanced and designed for PC more than console, as well as receiving updates at the same time or faster as console, in addition to having the PTR.Also, from what I know at the high ranks on console most players use a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller with a special adapter, which gives them an unfair advantage on console while being standard on PC.So I'd recommend moving to PC if you can make the transition (like DSP Stanky did) but if console is your thing where all your friends are you should probably stay there.","

"Usually, the tactic is simple. When looking for a first pick to snowball from, the healer is your best target. The first team to kill the opposing healer has the greatest advantage for the team fight. Moira, however, is a new beast in that regard. She is not just a simple pick. She is ruthless by design. She opposes the aging tactical staple of “kill the healer first.” Instead, she is a close range healer that encourages high health pools and tight knit groups. With multiple teammates to guard her and a high sustainability she is not going to be that simple pick. That “Overwatch Old” strategy falls apart. This means tactics from this character must change and adaptation is finding new life in my favorite game. Since Moira encourages tight knit formations, the strategy changes from “kill the healer” to “divide and conquer.”  Moira, being a close range healer, needs to be separated from the majority of her team to disable her healing. If she is too far away, she cannot speed boost, Guardian angel or snipe to heal her mates. Instead, she will be forced to use her fade. If she does this, she becomes much more predictable and easier to focus down. If she does not, she will only have her healing orb to provide aid to distant allies, which is far better for the opposing team than a healing orb combined with primary fire. To me, Moira also enables Mei for the team that opposes her. Mei is equipped specifically for separating the opposing team and sometimes isolating singular characters at a time. Roadhog is also adept at separating characters from their teams. Roadhog is better at bringing Moira down than most, but hooking anyone removes them from healing range and, of course, into range of a face full of rusty bits.Junkrat. He punishes clustered enemies. Pharah. Punishes clustered enemies and can force them apart with Concussive Blast.I hope more characters of varying specialties are given to us in the future. I always love to see a game evolve past it’s own cliches.","

"Mercy and Lucio also have similar survivability to Moira, as you pointed out Moira's is worse as once she uses fade she becomes a sitting duck.Moira's real strength and the one that comes up most often in complaints is her ability to duel. No one cares that Mercy flies around the battlefield because she doesn't really hit back. No one cares that a good Lucio who can wallride and hit his shots is both hard to hit and hard hitting. Moira does basically what a good Lucio does and outheals your damage and hits you back hard. She has low dps but the almost guaranteed nature of it means it's a 4 or 2 second time for her kill squishy characters.

The survivability itself isn’t new, but she is admittedly easy to learn. On the flip side, the two most popular flankers to take down the main healer are Tracer and Genji. Lucio is not the main healer and his value from speedboost is arguably better than his healing song and also easy to grab value from as is his viability near ledges on certain maps. That said, I know Lucio needs a little buff love. Moira is easy to play with low average damage because there isn’t much else that can counter the popular flankers and still be so close to balanced as a healer. She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.","

She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.I don't think her kit should be changed. I think Ana, Mercy and Lucio need some buffs(in that order for priority). If they're not Blizzard needs to decide what they consider a balanced support is. If it's Moira then other people needs buffs, if it's Zen that Moira may need some slight number tweaks and she's head and shoulders in a higher tier than all the other supports.I can agree with that.","

Massive heals and damage.That comparison is very shallow. Allowing a similar team composition does not mean they both are countered in the same way(or not at all). Moira can be separated and her healing is diminished. Ana can snipe heal. Ana wasn’t an anti flanker. Ana had no resource meter. Ana had a better ultimate.,"

"There is another side of it too.For most of match making, this is the first time there's been a viable healer that actually has the raw healing to sustain a teammate through nearly anything a single hero can throw at them.  I mean seriously... if you stack Moira's left click and heal ball, you are looking at 155 HPS.  That's a bit insane.  Most heroes can't chop through that alone without ridiculously good aim.Suddenly... you can't handle Moira with the two ways you'd normally handle healers... Those being either kill them as you mentioned or simply land way more damage than they can heal.  Instead you need to either shoot something that Moira isn't healing, force Moira to bail, force Moira and her healing target apart, or insta gib one of them.  This is causing problems for a lot of people because I've noticed that especially around my level... they are pretty bad at target priority and if you go lower I imagine it gets worse.","

"Here's just one idea...FPS exploded in popularity (at least on consoles) after games like Goldeneye/Perfect dark... which were then followed by the huge hits like Halo1, Halo2, and then of course Halo3, which is about the time the Call of Duty games showed up and started eating halo's market share.Since then, FPS games (again, at least as far as consoles are concerned) kinda peaked... and haven't much evolved.  We've all heard of the CoD/halo clones and how generic they are.In all of those^ games, it was all about GLORY.  How many kills can you secure?  I still remember when Halo2 dropped and it was the first time I'd heard of a ""K/D"" spread... after that... it's like all my friends and I cared about were how many kills we got.  And even then, those kills didn't matter if we were dying a lot.  So anyway, shooters peaked, and companies are looking for ways to switch up the formula.  One of those ways is to introduce game play that forces cooperation and focus on objectives, rather that just going and out securing kills each. and. every. game. like the last 50 FPS titles we've played over the earlier years.I know I mentioned consoles even though OW is a PC game... but my point is... I wouldnt have touched OW if I hadn't first played those other FPS's on consoles.  Those earlier games gave me the confidence to just try in the first place, because I knew aiming with a mouse/keyboard would take some getting used to.At any rate... gamers need to adapt to OW, and those that refuse, well... they're gonna have a bad a time.","

He just kept returning to curse at me even more. I went to spectator and just repeatedly kicked him until he gave up joining, but not after a few players left, and Match chat received some of his choice P*/D*/F* words.Can we please have more control over blocking abusive players?

"As stated, Blizzard has stated that we already know or have ""met"" Hero 27. That stated, a barrage of who that may be has gone rampant with everyone grabbing at even the slightest mention of a throwaway character. This is my personal opinion of the best possible choices for a new Hero and the worst:=-=BESTBrigette Lindholm (Dragon Slayer Comic, Reflections Comic, Honor and Glory Short, Character Interactions)=One of the few characters with the most mentions and connections to other current Heroes, she is definitely a show in, especially after Blizzard created a character model for her in the Honor and Glory Short. As far as her role, I see her as a Defense character like her dad, maybe being able to fix or reinforce characters' machines/ shields, etc. Liao (First Strike Novel [CANCELED], Hero Document Hints [Ana])=As much as they redacted the First Strike comic, they still mention Liao on the Atlas News Articles as well as the documents hinting at Ana being the first new character. Be an interesting new dynamic if Liao was a duo with his/her robot companion, like the Ice Climbers or other similar duos from video games. Athena (Reflections Comic, Recall Short, In-Game Announcer)=Many people have been clamoring for Athena to be a Hero ever since they released the first concept pieces and even the cinematic trailer with a white feminine-looking robot that bears her logo. She has a big presence in Overwatch and to have a character that is an AI versus the likes of other current Omnic heroes would be interesting.Queen of Junkertown (Wasted Land Comic, In-Game Junkertown Announcer)=Another fan favorite, shows a lot of personality. Not only she has a character design as shown on posters all over Junkertown, it'd be cool to have a ""royalty"" character and have other characters mockingly referring to her as ""Your MajestyHammond (Map Document Hints [Horizon Lunar Colony])= A story arc introduced but never continued after the release of Horizon Lunar Colony, be interesting to see another animal creature butt heads against our main party animal, Winston.Olympia Shaw (Recall Short, Atlas News Articles)=She has a voice actor and character model, and she could be a news reporter turned field journalist. Concept art for her have drone cameras flying around so be a cool ability to have on the Overwatch battlefields=-==-=WORSTEmily (Reflections Comic)=Tracer's Girlfriend. She doesn't really have any shown traits and abilities, let alone enough lines to convey some kind of personality. She seem rather plain Jane and is meant to be someone in Tracer's life.Sanjay Korpal (A Better World Comic, Masquerade Comic)=Like Emily, Sanjay was just meant to be another Vishkar operative alongside Symmetra. He seems like an average Joe and doesn't even seem to possess the same powers as Symmetra does.Maximilien (Masquerade Comic)=Doesn't seem like the fighting type and his design would be similar to Zenyatta in a suit. A character that, while has a specific personality and role, is best kept in outside media, not in gameSam (Reflections Comic)=Pharah's dad. As much as I'd like a family dynamic, we barely have any info of him. We have more information of Hammond than we do of ""Sam"". Like Emily,he's just meant to be someone who is connected to a character outside of the gameKatya Volskaya (Searching Comic, Infiltration Short)=Highly doubtful she'd exists as a character within the game than a major plot point for Zarya and Sombra in Overwatch mediaThe Meddling Kids (Cinematic Trailer)=They're kids. Pretty sure Blizzard frowns upon killing kids in the battlefield, least if they want to keep that T for Teen rating. While people have been clamoring for them too, the most unlikely to happen. Sure Blizzard could age them but the timeline is messed enough to have the character retain their ages.Alejandra (Searching Comic, Hero Short)=Again, she's a child. Same reason for the above.Hakim (Old Soldiers Comic)=I've seen some posts about him but he seems more like a throwaway character than anything elseHarold Winston (Recall Short)=He's dead. As much as Blizzard and Overwatch characters love pulling the ""I'm dead but not really"" (Ana, Soldier 76, Reaper), Winston must have had some time on the Moon after the other subjects on base killed the scientists before escaping. That meaning he saw them murder Dr. Harold Winston. Gerard Lacroix (Reflections Comic, In-Game Mentions)=He's dead, like above. Widowmaker visits his grave in the Reflections comic which means there was a dead body to bury unlike the Return from the Dead trio who were assumed dead since their bodies were never recovered. Unlikely that Overwatch would pull a Zombie character on us.Mayor Nandah (Uprising Origin Short)=No.Guillermo Portero (Sombra ARG, Castillo Arena Map)=No.Lynx Seventeen (Searching Comic)=While a cool snarky character, his design is very similar to Zenyatta's and we already have a Hacker character=-==-=Let me know of your personal opinions or if there were any other characters that I have missed to mention. Of course, if you feel like someone should be or shouldn't be a hero let me know why!","

"Sanjay Korpal is one of the worst? Nope, he is probably one of the best. In Moira’s origin story, you can see him sitting on the far left of the Talon leaders’ table (and that is very clearly him). In Masquerade you can also see him at the Talon leaders’ table next to Doomfist (albeit not as similar). Why would a ‘background’ character appear in three different pieces of media?

Especially when in Asia it's a last name first bases.  Since people seem to be Liking what I've been speculating, it if is Liao, I'm going to add this as my speculation as to what his kit could be. 12/29/2017 08:33 PMPosted by TidalWavesI've been batting ideas around since the summer and i posted this in another thread and people seemed to like it, so I'll add onto it. I'll also admit that I'm writing things on AO3 involving both characters mentioned on AO3. Ideas for speculated Hero: Fan design WIP based off a pannel of the first strike panel, the blue visor guy from the recall short AND a hero concept : https://tidalwavesstudio.deviantart.com/art/The-missing-founding-Member-Blackwatch-Liao-WIP-707836001Name: Lee LiaoCallsign(s): Phantom, Lotus, Helio, Rey Leon(Lion King) Age: 48 approxGender: maleBirthplace: SingaporeLanguages: English (fluent), Mandarin Chinese (fluent), Malay, ocassionally uses ""Singlish"", Usually when annoyed and most often under his breath, Omnicode/ Omnic Script (Due to his implants). Rank: Captain/ Blackwatch Second in commandAffiliation: Singapore Armed forces & Lion force/ Overwatch and BlackwatchLocation: Went MIA prior to the Zurich event (Hiding in safehouses in Asia and South East Asia. Rarely visits Singapore unless Talon activity is observed)Specialization: Tech/Robotics ExpertClass: Tank or Def HeroHealth: 200 or more depending on classWeapon type: Modified SAR model rifle.Primary fire- Pulse Fire:Clip size of 15-20 with an average to slow reload time (again depending on class)Secondary fire -Plasma shot:Clip of 3-5 that does more damage but with a 20-30 second cool down timer.*Other Abilities: see bottom notes.Ult: 愿狮子保护我 / ""May the lions protect me""An ult in where he calls two lion mechs/ robots to his side, the male Jiù zhǔ (Savior) casts a small shield from his right shoulder while the female Yōulíng (Spectre) does something more offensive maybe, like a damage over time weapon like a flamethrower?Backstory: Liao's Pre Overwatch Life is known to few, but those who do know know that the man was a genius who had earned several degrees (in Biotech -implants for domestic and militaristic use, and prosthetics- and Robotics engineering) and opened his own company before 18. In that time he created two miniature Lion drones to preform simple scouting tasks.When he turned (**)16, he and several friends joined the SAF as reservists where they trained and eventually fought on the front lines, helping to holding down half of the island nation while trying to reclaim the other half from the Omnics. During that time he would go on to lead and form a small special forces group called ""Lion Force"", which remained operational after the Omnic Crisis. After the liberation of Singapore, Liao was sought out and asked to become a founding member of Overwatch despite being the youngest member at 18 years. His quick wit, stealth and drive to finish a mission using any means possible earned him the respect of Reyes who later asked him to help form the covert ops group Blackwatch.Sometime the golden age of Overwatch he worked Closely with Mei, eventually earning her ire and distrust when he stole Cyrogenics research in an attempt to weaponize it. This began to further go down hill with the eventual departure of both McCree and Genji. As Tensions grew in Overwatch, Reyes was deemed to be unfit to continue leading Blackwatch, but when Liao went to relieve him of his duty, a fight broke out with Reyes taunting and threating Liao, which only caused the Singaporean to stab the older man and start a fight.Both men escaped with their lives, but Reyes was greatly wounded while Liao had lost his left eye and was partially blind in his right eye after the older man had shattered his visor.Luckily he had been developing a new kind of implant/ cybernetic prosthetic to help those who had lost their sight trough various means, as well as to help the military by providing them with an ocular lense that included a Combat HUD. With the help of Mercy he became the sole test subject of his new occular implants and spent years improving and updating the combat software and rotating around safehouses while making ""hit and run"" raids against Talon. Eventually he managed to track down Ana and helped her recover as well, disapointed that she did not accept his offer for an ocular implant like himself. After recovering in Singapore, he left, returning only once durring the ""Bras Basah"" incident in late 2076 where he took down a small taskforce of Talon agents with his Lions. The only knowledge of Liao's status at that time was the two large gold Lion mechs. After the incident, Singapore's security tightened even further, making life much more difficult for Talon.In mid to late 2077 Liao was once again sighted in Lijang China, and recognized when his accent slipped while he left out a string of ""Singlish"" as he fought. His identity was confirmed when a Talon operative pulled his visor up off his face. Luckily Mei was able to step in and aid in Liao's escape.Once again his whereabouts are unknown, but based on his actions against Talon he is willing to answer the recall. It's speculated that he's close to 50 years of age.Due to his implants, he can read Omnicode, something that only augmented humans can read and understand. He's known to be somewhat shy and flustered around cute women but there are rumors that he and Mei were once involved and she helped him to largely overcome his shyness towards women. He can be spontaneous, and is a self proclaimed ""savage, Sarcastic, $#!t giving @$$#073."" He likes to keep busy and keep things interesting as he'll ""go crazy"" otherwise. Outside of a charm his mother gave him as a child, and a dragon bracelet givent to him by Mei, he wears no jewelry outside of his SAF and Overwatch dogtags. While unmarried, he wears a ring on his dogtags and gets rather moody when asked about it.It's extremely rare to see him outside of his uniform or in a short sleeved shirt. On his right arm he has a tattoo of two chinese Lions and a dragon in black white and red -basically a tattoo with no color and basic shading- that runs from his shoulder to his elbow, a sign of drunken dubachary with is Lion force Squad during the Omnic crisis.*Now As i said this is just something I've been screwing with for the last few months and I have little idea of balancing I have no idea which of his abilities would be overpowered a friend and i were discussing things and we agreed that maybe instead of both Lions maybe he could switch between Lions like Sym does with her ult, or he could command the Lions separately to more minor effect as an ability or something. It could also be possible to cancel his ult maybe if you take out one of his lions putting them on any abilities using them on a cooldown? the thread I previously posted this in liked the idea of two lions and there seems to gen a small group who want a hero that uses a flamethrower. Some people Like the idea that Liao could use his lions independently -outside of an ult- and destroying one could roleblack him or prevent him from using his ult until the Lion's cooldown ends.Again I have no idea what character balancing is, and i'm just messing about with ideas.**Long story short, Singapore has mandatory enlistment, so that they're ready in any situation. some countries allow you to join the army Reserves at 16 whereas in Singapore minimum age to enlist as a reservist is 16 and a half. In the omnic Crisis they likely dropped the minimum age to 16. i posted more in a thread titled ""whatever happened to Liao"" Trust me, I've really expanded on the possibilities of Liao's backstory, abilities and such, but I tried to keep things brief in this post.","

"I don’t know how some of these things happen but any of you die in super unlucky ways that can almost seem to unlikely. Or just so dumb ?Most of these happened when I was invis with Sombra. I was running behind a Winston and he turns around and turns on his Tesla gun instantly making me visible and then started to kill me. In the death cam it shows him try destroying his own widows poison trap and continue to try shooting it then I run by and his gun auto shoots me . Another time I almost felt like this was too impossible, but we are on Anubis and defending, their team is outside the point A enterance and I was invis going to run outside to hack the health packs. The team had no Hanzo or widow to uncover me yet a Roadhog manages to hook me. I was completely invisible since it takes a second to go invis and on the replay shows the hog just randomly hooking into the air, then grabs me, like was he just testing out his hook at the air or was he expecting someone to just come through the enterance... What are some unlucky or dumb ways you have died?","

"One of the main problems with CTF in Overwatch is that there is 2 objectives: defend your flag or capture the enemy flag. In a team based game where staying together is key, this doesn't work so well. Here are my ideas to add a version of CTF that would work even better for Overwatch.Players have to take the neutral flag which spawns in the center of the map to the enemy base, which converts it to that team's flag and can now be captured at your base. Once the flag is converted, it is basically CTF like how we have now except only with one flag.Neautral flag spawns at the center of the mapScore by taking the flag to the enemy base to convert the flag, then take the flag back to your baseUsing any ability while carrying the flag will drop the flagCannot pick up the flag while any ability is activeNo flag returns when the flag is neutralOnce your team has converted the flag, the enemy team can return the flag, which sets it back to the center of the map and makes the flag neutral againFlag pickup time: instantFlag dropped lock time: 3 secondsFlag return time: 3 secondsWhen the flag is captured, it resets to the center and is locked for 10 seconds2 roundsFirst round time: 6 minutesFirst round ends early if a team scores 3 flagsSecond round time: same as first round6 flag captures to winOvertime bar should not freeze if the currently winning team is the team holding the flag at the end of the second roundSudden death on draw","

"Massive downvotes inc as this forum love low skill ceiling heroes being able to have massive impact, like Mercy& Junkrat.First, I want you to watch this video in the time I linked it, so you truly understand the context, the engagement, and how does it feel to fight a Moira, incase you don't play DPS at all, you won't really know how it feels.https://youtu.be/lgL0Er3UAQg?t=382That video comes from Kragie, a proffesional player currently in London's Spitfire academy team, which will be playing Contenders, a league below OWL, consistently top10 tracer player, Rank1 multiple times, incase you say ""bad dps""Here we go, this is gonna be explained with plenty of details1- The first argument people say when trying to defend Moira is :""DPS players are just mad because finally a support can fight back""Wrong, it's not the fact that Moira can fight back, it's the fact that Moira has ALL the advantages and her kit sets her to win the fight vs the majority of the DPS RosterAna can fight back, she can land 3 shots on you and you're dead, or 2 and a Nade, or land the skillshot known as Sleep Dart and kill you.Zenyatta can fight back, he discords you, rightclick you instantly oneshotting you, or simply left click headshot you once and bodyshotting onceZenyattas in the OWL have massive impact, even getting 3-4 kills per fight and carrying, as shown by JJonak vs Seoul Dynasty.Zenyattas in the OWL take the 1v1 duels against Tracer and they do win them with a decent percentage, Rawkus shut down SBB during World Cup plenty of times.Lucio can fight back, he's incredibly hard to kill and since his projectile speed increase he can land headshots on you and take you down.What's the difference, all those require SKILL to win against a DPS.Moira doesn't have to aim, she has a 6s CD on one of the best mobility abilities in the game, she has insane HP drain, range, and 100% accuracy damage, an orb to fully top her if she's under pressure.A support is not meant to have THE EDGE when engaging a DPS in a fight, he should be able to defend himself and win if he is the better player, like a good zenyatta does.2- Stats, Moira has completely replaced Mercy in the top1 hero across ALL ranks.She is oficially the most picked hero in the game as of right nowHaving 11% pickrate in GM and 55.72% winrate, she's really not that far off Mercy that used to have 15%+- pickrate.Having 11% pickrate means she is close to be in almost every game, and still manages to have almost 56% winrate, as she will be in both teams the winrate can't be much higher as one has to lose.3- Excels at TOO many things and has no weaknessesAna: used to have the best healing potential, a high impact ability in sleep dart, and a high potential to make plays with Nade.0 mobility, no sustain apart from nade which is a long CDZen: very good utility with discord, crazy damage potential, best support ultimate0 mobility, gigantic hitbox, no sustain as regen doesn't work in combat, low healing outside of TransLucio: good utility with speed and boops, good mobility, good sustain.Low healing outside E, people have to be grouped up to make his healing effective, sub par ultimate as there's too much damage in the game and Trans is much better, low damage compared to other supports, slow building ultimateMoira?Best heals in the game, fastest charging ultimate, best survability in the support category, 2nd best moblity among supports, very useful ultimate specially if combined with a good tank frontline, ability to completely zone out flankers, ability to win the fight against the majority of the DPS roster, ability to finish off kills with ease, ability to put pressure with damage orb, ability to combo healing+ healing orb doing insane amounts of healingWhat's the tradeoff? basically nothing, with ana you trade amazing heals and utility for poor mobility, with zen you trade amazing damage potential and best support ult with poor mobility, a giant hitbox and low healing4- Skill needed to be impactfulZen is technically OP by looking at his winrates, pickrates, tournament play and overall utility in the gameHow many people do really complain about Zen? How many ""Genji mains"" complain about zen?Transendence completely nullifies dragonblade's impact, making it useless.Do you see any outcry of genji mains crying about it and making countless posts about it? I don'tWhy? Trans is a slow building ultimate, more or less, unless you are one of the best zens in the world and get headshots nonstop every fight, which doesn't happen and if it does, it still doesnt build as fast as Moira's.Zen trades off 0 mobility, a gigantic hitbox and low healing for the best ultimate in the support category.Zen has the highest kill potential out of any support, do you see people complaining about getting killed by Zen? I don't, why?Zen takes a lot of skill to land the shots, so does Ana with sleep darts, hence they deserve to have such impact.Moira has no real mechanical requirement, her beam doesn't require aim, just looking at the general direction of the enemy, her healing isn't exactly very mechanically demanding either, her orbs also take next to no skill, and she has a 6s CD skill that gets her out of danger and allows her to gain range to keep distance and drain HP back.5- What can be done to make her balanced?Reducing the amount of HP drain per second with the damage beam ( Most important change needed )Increasing Fade cooldown to 8 seconds from 6.Increasing the points needed to get ultimate, making it slower to charge.What does this mean?Moira will still be able to zone out/kill flankers/DPS, as she still retains her range, and damage.However Moira will not be able to duel DPS heroes mindlessly knowing she will win, as the HP drain is reduced and they could OUTDPS in an easier fashionHer ult charge would be on par with the rest of the heroes, specially support heroes.Players would need to think when is the right time to fade, instead of spamming fade as soon as there's any danger as it will be back very fast.This is basically it, now I know people are gonna comment the typical arguments, haha tracer/genji main, moira is not OP because... I have fun with her! and the rest of the poor arguments that they bringGo on, I really don't care about your poor arguments, this post will be checked by the people that matter, I'm pretty sure they're aware of the issue anyways.I wrote this as Im bored with the current ranked situation, it's pretty much a joke with the onetricks ruining games. unbalanced MM, trolls and throwers, I gained elo today and didn't even feel good about it as the quality of games was horrible.I expect Moira nerfs soon, cheers!","

"Many of DOTA 2's heroes are considered low skill, especially support heroes. Some supports like Rubick (a squishy mage who can stun and steal enemy abilities) are harder to use than, for instance, Omniknight (a straightforward, tanky support with an AOE heal and the ability to turn his entire team invincible). Funnily enough, most of them have about the same impact. Some more than others, but not always. They bring different things to a team. Rubick can copy and repeat gamechanging ultimates, while Omniknight can grant invincibility to pretty much all forms of damage. It's good. Maybe if Blizzard were good at balance, there wouldn't be threads like these made on the daily because every support (and, indeed, a good deal of heroes) would be balanced.Too bad.","

"I'll play Devil's advocate and say I agree with you (I do for some of this and agree she is a bit too versatile but overall find it to be rubbish) the nerfs you suggested are ridiculous. The only reasonable one is making her ult require more points since she really does get it every team fight. If she were to get nerfed, it'd be making her HP drain only give her 20 or 30 hps a second. This way she demands for people with proper positioning to do dmg and recharge her resource over getting careless and flanking all the time. She'd be easier to kill for DPS but she wouldn't be overnerfed. Either way, she has her healing orb or a second healer to help keep her up. But aside from that and her ult charge, she's perfectly fine and is in a good spot.","

A hero based around dodging, movement and mobility (alongside Genji) is picked in a scene where people are incredibly good at aiming, with sharp reflexes. Wonder why that could be. Guess their aim's just !@#$.I think Moira's heals shouldn't cleave an entire team (she has the reverse Ana problem- instead of being able to heal a single tank up to full, she has the ability to heal multiple tanks rapidly), probably should be limited to two heroes maximum (or require more juice for healing more heroes). I also think her ult charges too fast. That's it.","

"I think people hate him because it's easy to be on the defence, pick a Bastion, and have people almost instinctively pick Reinhardt and/or Mercy to complement the pick. From there, the plan is easy, defend the Bastion while he defends the point.When you're on the attack however, coordination seems a bit more scattered. It's difficult to rally everyone or utilize counter picks to dislodge the defence.That said, he is fairly weak. I have a lot of trouble with him, personally, but I've seen better players deal with him with ease...","

"Bastion is a really good counter pick when you're in the middle of the match and lacking a good defence against tank-heavy or flank reliant comps. Most players don't see him coming, and by the time they adjust their strategy he already has his ult up and support backing him up. I've changed the course of many payload games by pulling out Bastion and he can absolutely decimate teams when unsuspected.The problem many people have is with the low skill ceiling involved when playing Bastion, because he hits like a tank. However I disagree with many people when they say he's a complete face-roll,  I believe he takes a certain amount of map awareness and decision making to be decent. A good Bastion will never go turret mode in the same place repeatedly, he will always be running around and setting up in different places constantly to catch enemies off guard.Basically to summarise, he guns down your tanks, catches your flankers by surprise, and forces you to re-think your strategy a lot of the time.","

To reach somebody for a rez that died on a roof or something that I can't reach.

"Even after the nerfs to Mercy I find myself now forced to play Moira :cI know Moira is balanced, and Mercy has the stigma attached to her still, but there's one other character who I ADORE and wish I could play. Ana.Probably one of my favourite characters EVER. I adore her story, and I love her character. Protecting the ones you love really fits with who I try to be as a person, and I love how the devs even managed to get that feeling across with her ABILITIES. Something really special that they totally nailed on the head here.Though I wish I could actually play her again WITHOUT being a liability to my team :/Ana is STILL struggling to find a place in the game after all the nerfs, even the MUCH needed damage buff wasn't enough to really bring her back. The game has just changed and evolved so much since she was last really in favour. I would like her to be a viable pick along with Moira and Mercy.So for that I offer TWO buff ideas;Increase her Ammo count to 15; make it less punishing for Ana to miss, defend herself, or healing targets where 75 hp would be a ""waste"". Ana is still the only support with as much downtime on healing. Moira's regenerates passive AND is refilled by helping attack; Ana's is used up for healing and attacking. Reloading is Ana's BIGGEST weakness for healing that gives her these weird periods of not being able to do anything to really help the team in a meaningful way. It wasn't as bad when her Grenade gave 100% heal bonus and she did 80 damage because the risk of missing and reloading were rewarded with more power. (Though they did need to be nerfed, there needed to be compensation somewhere else in her kit to make up for the 50% and 20% nerf)ANDGive Ana a healing passive based on her theme of being a ""mother"" and ""protector"" where she heals hp based on the health of the target she is HEALING using only her rifle (Grenade doesn't count) so she isn't better in 1v1 duels BUT can at least heal up chip damage and stay in fights30 hp for healing 200 or less hp targets20 hp for healing 250 to 300 hp targets10 hp for healing targets with more than 400This way it rewards skill hitting smaller targets, giving you more health AND spamming into tanks doesn't make your health regenerate super fast spamming into them. Plus it will only work healing MISSING health, not just standing there spamming into a Sentry Mode Bastion to get your health back.I think that would help sort her biggest issues of survivability and consistancy; which every support has 0 issues with. They can still be killed, but they're not just free ult like an Ana is currently.Hopefully someone up there in the sky sees this and chimes in, but I really do miss playing Ana without being threatened every comp game","

You'd think with Moira and her massive aoe healing Ana's nade could rule supreme, but with it only lasting 4 seconds now and it's long cooldown, I don't think it will be enough. Her sleep dart is simply not reliable enough to rely on it to make an impact, and her ult is lacking to say the least. Ana needs help!Make Ana great again!#maga","

(I'm also not saying Moira is overpowered, Ana and arguably Mercy lost too much impact)The problem with buffing Ana to heal tanks more is that she's already SO good at it. It's healing the lower health, and smaller characters she struggles more with that Mercy and Moira don't with their lack of aim requirements.Moira can spray and use her orb, and Mercy can triage forever. Every time you shoot as Ana you're getting closer to loading and downtime so it's MUCH harder to keep up more than 2 people even WITH her grenade in the current way the game has been balanced.And your English is spot on :P","

Ana was the only support who could keep up a lot of high health targets, now Moira can do that with less effort. Ana's ult struggles as well with mobility since it's easier now to escape from the boosted target, and when Discord is a guarantee to give someone a 30% damage reduction, why bring an ULT that is only a touch better.If they came out and said; we're waiting to see what happens to Ana after the Mercy nerfs settle, I would be okay. However it is still a sad though that Ana was SO bad for almost a YEAR before she even got her damage buffed to 70 :/I kinda get this sad feeling they're SCARED to really buff Ana because of how salty people got when she was good, without realsing that the game is 100% different from then to now. Lucio, Mercy, andBastion have been reworked, Roadhog and D.va aren't the same characters, Zarya and 76 were nerfed, Reaper, Sombra, Junkrat, and Orisa were buffed, and Doomfist and Moira were added to the game.You nerfed Ana in the perfect spot when you took the heal bonus down, and the duration of the Grenade. Now please fix her core issues so I don't get screamed at for not playing the current best support. I want to know my pick has a 50/50 chance of winning, not knowing that most games end with Ana being on the losing side 40/60","

"02/08/2018 07:20 AMPosted by GollyWizif they give her a better rate of fire and her nade can heal over time like moria she should be fine. also maybe a faster reload or a slightly bigger clipHer rate of fire keeps her healing balanced; Her current healing is 90 hps, the highest in the game. Buffing that would put her a touch too goodHer grenade is perfect the way it is; it got the much needed nerfs, and doesn't feel like a total ""Oh I win"" button like it used to. Plus can't say no to that 100 bust health. Plus I don't want every support to overlap, I like how they each have their own ways of bringing something to the table; why I want Ana's passive healing to be tied to her healing done, no other support has that effect.The faster reload or bigger clip are what she REALLY needs. Either less downtime on her healing OR to be less punishing for ""over heals"" and defending yourself.","

Unless you quick scope as Ana, because her unscoped primary is a projectile, the hitbox on it is JUST big enough that it will tend to hit a barrier rather than a friendly or enemy target","

"02/17/2018 11:33 PMPosted by Tophershe can 1 shot tracer and 2 shot any 200 hp hero and he pellets are rather large.1. only in close range and only if you headshot twice and only if the target does get healed or shielded. On a range of 55m you need 5 headshots or 9 body shots to kill a target. By 0.8 sec per shot it would you take atleast 4 sec, if you only hit headshots on that distance. And if we now also think about accuracy on that distance. Yeah. there is no way you gonna kill someone.Hanzo can 1 shot every hero 200 hp hero. Is he a good dps? Take away his scatter arrow. Is he still good?""Yeah Mei is not a sniper you idiot!"" Yeah. So you have to be pretty close to an enemy, less than 26m to deal full damage or less than 10m to freeze someone. While having no escape ability, no movement ability and the worst selfheal ability in the game.Soldier heals in a area of 5m 40 health per sec for 5 sec. Can still shot, move, ult etc. (15 sec cd)Bastion heals himself for 75 health per sec. Can still move. (no cd)Tracer can heal herself back to full health and get out of the fight/ sticky situations. (12 sec cd)Roadhog heals himself for 300 health in 1 sec and still move while taking 50% less damage. (8 sec cd)Ana can heal herself instant for 100 hp. (10 sec cd)Moira can heal herself for 75 health per sec using orb (10 sec cd) or 105 health per sec using orb and secondary.Mei only heal herself for 37.5 health per sec in a duration of 4 sec. sure she cant take damage while doing this, but she also cant move or do anything. 4 sec not doing anything and just gets 150 health back.","

"So for clarification, I wanted to emphasize beforehand that I am using Zarya in this situation. I am getting so tired of getting yelled at by my team for holding my ult. It's not because I don't want to use it, but rather when I spam ""group up"" and ""ult ready"" together, only maybe one person ever shows up (usually a healer). I had a Genji today who got furious at me for holding my ult practically the whole game, even after I tried to explain that I had repeatedly messaged that I wanted the group over a period of about 5 minutes. Only ever did Ana show up. I never knew where he was and didn't want to squander my ult. The same goes for the rest of the team I had in that situation. Everyone except Ana kept just kept doing their own solo thing. Same thing yesterday. Only my friend (playing Moira, mind you), ever really wanted to capitalize on my ultimate. I don't want to waste my ult-- because Zarya's is amazing when used correctly. But if it's wasted, it takes quite some time to get her ult back. So am I in the wrong? Should I do something else?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If you keep finding yourself waiting for a moment that never comes, yeah, you're wasting your ult by not using it. There's not much you can do to make your teammates group up better. So work with what you've got. A few two or three-man gravs is better than one that gets four.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"I mean, in most cases, just having at least one other person that can follow up on your ult effectively is enough to turn a game.

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
Yes and no. Its right to save ult but after awhile you might as well use it since in the time you hold it you could have built another. Dont be afraid if you see the chance to grav 4-6 ppl. Plus you can capitalize on grav by yourself if you are 80+ charge. And in most cases people here a zarya ult and look to find it. So just get into the mentality of I can build this back up so as long as i can use it to kill at least 2 or so its good. Dont waste it on solo though. Imo,"

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"Most flanking dps (especially Genjis and Tracers who benefit from Zarya's ult) cannot join the tank because of their positioning. They are flankers, and if you are playing with an aggressive player, they might not be able to make it to your tank's position safely.In short, it is too much to expect your entire team to group up behind you if you are not playing a Reinhardt and running a deathball comp.Instead, when you call out your ult, your Genji/Tracer should call out their ult in response and tell you if they have it (or what %). You can then coordinate your ults that way. Assuming you're not using voice and can't type to ask for someone to tell you their ult status, that's about the best you can expect.If they're not responding, hit tab and view your team's status. It will display their ult status as a checkmark below their name. You can track ults that way and hope they are paying attention to your ult line.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If nobody is coordinating with you, then figure out a plan B. If you can't orchestrate a big teamwipe (or even a couple of guaranteed kills), can you solo ult/kill a high value target? Can you pull people off of an objective or off of an advantageous location? Can you save your supports by locking down the flanker who's trying to kill them?Basically I find for me that it's helpful to not just know what your ideal circumstance is for getting max value out of your ult, but also having some options for working around unhelpful teammates. Hopefully you won't need to call on that option too often, but in solo queue you're probably gonna need it now and again.","

"1100 hours on Mercy (almost all those hours are from comp on PS4) taking a break from the game for a few reasons.1) I haven’t asked for a revert on Mercy. I thought she was OP with her double insta res during ult and needed tweaking. However, I find her so unfun and underwhelming to play now. At least with old Mercy when you pulled off a sweet res you got to feel like a badass. She’s more balanced now and still a great healbot, but there’s no longer a moment to really shine. 2) The toxicity in game is another reason I’m leaving. It is terrible on PS4. I find it amusing that people get instantly banned for a week on the forums for saying something silly like “so dumb” (no joke), yet I report someone in game for telling a 13 year old to go kill themself and nothing happens. With all the Mercy hate lately it’s been even worse. I dropped from high masters to mid-diamond, I’m female, and I have a platinum boarder...you can only imagine the crap I’ve had to endure.3) The smurf problem on PS4 is the last reason. I’ve posted extensively about this, but according to Jeff, smurfs aren’t as big an issue as we make them out to be, Mercy is fine now, and toxicity has improved...and unfortunately from my perspective, I disagree. I still enjoy watching OWL and will continue to do so, but for now I will enjoy being just a spectator.","

"02/10/2018 02:54 PMPosted by EquinoxIf only 25 other heroes and a mute button existedI like playing Mercy (obviously), and I do mute and block people. It still ruins the experience when it happens as often as it does. That isn’t Blizzard’s fault - it’s crappy human beings. I was in skirmish the other day waiting to get in a comp match and some guy asked if I was a girl then said oh you sound like a whale. That happens all the time. Sure I mute them and chug along, but the damage is already done.","

I would love to come back if Mercy gets the changes she deserves (and I agree that is not a revert), but I don’t see that being any time soon based on what Jeff has said and historical evidence.I would also like to add that OW really needs an evidence-based report system. I used to take the time to make Twitch highlights of throwers after games and include the link in my reports. It was pretty frustrating to find out no one reads the reports and punishment is based off of # of reports.","

"Hello, I'm Robo. My favorite hero in Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support is Tracer, Hanzo, D.Va, and ZenyattaMy main is TracerMy favorite ability is Pulse Bomb, its so satisfying to stick :DFavorite skin is a tie between Cadet Oxton for Tracer and Soldier's Alpine. I would like to learn Widowmaker.My tip for playing Tracer would be to never be under 120 HP. Ever. 125 if they have Hanzo. I think having a meta is okay, but I would rather it not be there. It doesn't have as much of an impact in the matches as people think. My favorite OWL team is probably NYXLI watch KarQ and Erstadan, KarQ is my favoriteI think people play tank the least. I think people don't play tanks as much because there's not too much feedback, like with DPS you get the elims and with support you get the healing, utility, and saves, but with Tanks (not D.Va, Hog) it just feels like doing nothing half the time in my opinion.

Sanzang (i think thats how you spell it) for ZenyattaWhat hero would you like to learn? Moira or WidowmakerIf you could give someone a tip to playing your main what would it be? Please for the love of God remember to use Fortify. It can stop a lot of things and if I remember correctly it cuts down the damage you take.What type of hero would you like hero 27 to be? I'm guessing a tank that screws up the dive meta. Right now the only tanks that do that are in the dive meta themselves.Do you think having a Meta is a good thing? Kinda of i suppose, I mean I don't like how some treat the meta as a sacred text that must be followed.What is your favorite Overwatch League team?

"Favourite hero in each category: Sombra, Mei, Dva, Mercy Main: Mercy favourite ability: EMP least favorite ability: Tactical visor Favourite skin: Zhuque (think it’s spelt like that) for MercyWhat hero would you like to learn: AnaTip for main: Never Rez during Valkyrie, it’s a waste of time when you could be healing and you get melted. Hero 27: Defence who could be a solid counter to high mobility heroes e.g tracer, Sombra and Genji Is meta good: yes becasue it helps you win and no because it excludes a lot of heroes Favourite OWL team: London spitfire and Houston OutlawsDo you watch Overwatch Youtubers: Bro you wack and Guzzo Least played role: support and tankWhy: Supports are constantly nerfed or ‘changed’ to the pontiff where they are either underpowered or unfun to play and tanks don’t feel rewarding to play as well as they don’t have a objective other than stand and bloack damage which is dull when’s you could play dps I met a girl called Kayleigh and we are now pretty much best friends, we play overwatch together and we play other games with eachother, I met her in Comp and she added me becasue she’s liked how I played mercy and how nice and chill I was in comms. I made most of my monumental changes on overwatch with her; climbed to diamond with her And I climbed to masters with her. Got through every mercy nerf patch with her and she’s reassured me it was okay to play and she’s was still playable. We made even more friends playing together such a a girl called molly who was the nicest reaper main I had ever seen. And we’d met jake (unfortunately no longer talks to us as he doesn’t like us) but he was the most amazing dps/ tank player ever. Soon we added Ed to the list the dva main who climbed from silver to platinum. We met Gabe the most amazing Mei player ever with god Wallasey that would change the fight and save us all. I have made these friends and we are close as close could be and I woudlnt change it for the world. We grew together as players and as friends even though living in different parts of the world. Belgium, Sweden and the UK. I thank the overwatch team greatly because I would never have met these people without this game and I cant imagine life without them. We pick eachother up when we are down and even though we aren’t as close we all know when it comes to the weekend it’s ps4 party and overwatch time. We have the greatest times and Kayleigh’s laugh is contagious, jake’s jokes left us all in stitches, gabe’s sarcastic and evil comment he’d make when murdering the enemy team as Mei, Ed’s killer tunes that would pump us up for the fight, molly creativity and strategies that would get us cheesy victories and finally me, I don’t know what I did for us but they say I’m the glue that keep saying us together, I resolve disputes and make sure everyone isn’t on and has op haopy  what they are doing. And I made them laugh with my panic screeches walking back from spawn trying to get back in time to Rez or heal or something. They changes my life and it’s because of this game. I sincerely thank the overwatch team, the community for everything’s as I wouldn’t be here today as the confident and strong person I am now. I hope you all find friends and make the best memories on Thisbe game because I know I have and I wish people could to.","

"The big hooplah mostly come from one (or more):- Mercy's ult feels like it is does not have any impact in any way. Apart from flying and being able to chain within 10m, it's the exact same thing that Mercy does for the rest of her kit all the time and it cannot save a team if they're losing a fight unless it's a very very close fight.- Mercy's ult is boring to use. Same reasons above: it's just basically her normally, but flying. - Rez feels wonky to use. It makes you feel like you're moving through sludge when every other part of your kit is designed for mobility, you can't heal while using it, and you can't use it in the middle of a fight unless the person you're trying to rez died in the very back far away from the fight or they died behind a wall.Almost none of her kit requires any thought or planning now. Any. Whatsoever. It took away what little bit of decision making Mercy once had. Are you starting a team fight and a few people have low health? Okay, use Valk and stay in the skybox for 15secs. Is someone dead, no one on your team is in need of healing, and the enemy can't see you? Okay, use rez.","

She now has a niche and its not always useful.Which is bad, because everyone mained mercy because she was always viable with and aggaints every comp, she rewarded good players and punishes those who didn't know how to play her (except for the sr exploit).Now she lost that and its sad to see how she is useless in ult form.","

There are multiple heroes who can shield you while you res. I've seen it done before with my very own eyes, shielding Mercy while she res's. Teamwork!

They'll be targeted even while glowing, and they won't be able to react on time once they can move.-RIP Tire. Hide somewhere safe, then go for the kill.-Rocket Barrage. Normally a suicide button, against a team that's standing still and can't react on time, you have the element of surprise.-Self Destruct.

"Correction, only her standard kit is in a good place (e.g. healing, damage boosting, pistol usage although very rare, guardian angel with bunny hop) but her ultimate is no where near in a good place. It's simply a spectating ability and must be one of the most boring and least impactful ultimates in the game at the moment. It doesn't even deserve to be called an ultimate. Resurrect as a standard ability, in its current state, is pretty much a suicide button if your team doesn't defend you near a fight.","

"Let's look at it like this: do you ever dread having to use recall? Deflect? Defense Matrix? Boop? Because that's how a lot of people feel about rez; it incapacitates you to the point that you spend 2 seconds wondering will I survive this? The only ones I know who feel anything similar are Hog and Pharah mains who uses their ult, and those players often avoid using it because of the vulnerability. However, the risk of them comes with the potential to more or less team-wipe, and they still do damage and can somewhat defend themselves. Mercy players lose all agency when they rez, and the reward isn't even that great since if the Mercy dies immediately after the rez is completed the rezzed person often dies as well. And, unlike a Pharah or Hog that doesn't use their ults, Mercy players are often subjected to hate when they decide it's not safe to rez and get called throwers. Nobody should have to fear using something that the devs apparently envisioned as part of her regular kit. If something has to be put on such a long cooldown and have so many restrictions it's just not meant to be an ability, period.","

"#1. We should have Save (overwrite) and Save As as separate options.It's great that we can save configs now. However, I find it really weird and awkward that when I need to edit a config, the only option I have is 'Save as' (even though it's called Save), meaning that when I edit a config and save it, I'm offered to save it as a new one.90% of the time I just need to edit an existing config, not to have a new one. It's only natural that we should have separate Save (overwrite) and Save As options, because Save and overwrite would be used much more often.#2. When I edit a config and choose Save As, the suggested name for the config should be based on its current name, it shouldn't be my nickname.In addition to that, I find it very awkward that when I edit a config and then save it as a new one, the default name for the config is my nickname. When I'm saving from an existing config, it would make much more sense if the default name would be derived from the name of the config I'm editing. I.e. if I'm editing ""FFA Random Heroes"" config and choose Save as, the suggested name should be ""FFA Random Heroes (1)"", not ""Jekyll"".#3. Do not allow to have several configs with the same name.The game should NOT allow to have several configs with the same name! It only creates mess (especially since without save/overwrite option and with the default name being your nickname you're bound to accidentally create configs with the same name). The game should always offer a different name and should not allow the same name.I know it all might seem like minor things but when you often practice or have fun in custom games alone or with friends you often have to introduce small adjustments into your configs, and the current system makes it really awkward.","

"02/18/2018 04:42 AMPosted by RaymondWhen you save an edit of a config in custom games there is an option to make a new save or to override it to an existing one.No. There's an option to select and apply a saved config that will overwrite the currently selected settings only (which essentially isn't even an overwrite, it just applies the settings from the selected config), but the saved configurations are not altered in this process whatsoever. To alter configurations you have to use the Save button on the right. Which functions as a Save As button. When you press it, you indeed get a menu that lets me select a config to be overwritten, but it's an exceptionally weird and awkward way to do that. Why would I need to manually select a config I want to overwrite, then manually enter a name for it (because it suggests my nickname) instead of just having a ""Save"" option that doesn't ask me anything?In other words, all three of my suggestions seem valid for me.","

"Sombra isn't being buffed against Reinhardt, so this is just about her being in more games, right?Well, if she does show up more often, she'll be replacing a DPS. That DPS may be the Junkrat or Bastion who's been shredding your barrier recently. Or it may be the Tracer or Genji who's attacking your backline, ignoring your barrier entirely.Sombra can only hack one hero at a time, so if your barrier does get hacked, your off-tank can step in with their abilities. You can also body-block damage with your large, heavily armored health pool. Sombra's weapon has not had its damage buffed, merely had its spread reduced, so it isn't any stronger against tanks. Her rounds are also in just the right range for your armor to mitigate its damage. Most likely whoever she's replacing on your enemy team would have had much higher DPS than she does.To be honest, if I were tanking against a Sombra, I'd rather be a Reinhardt than an Orisa. A smart Sombra (dumb Sombras won't get much done) will hack Orisa right when her barrier needs to be refreshed; this leaves her with a barrier that's about to break, a smaller health pool than you, no Fortify, and a primary fire which is less suited to shooting agile heroes at close range and which slows her down when she's using it. I think you're going to be more effective hacked than she is. And a hacked Winston is a giant, lumbering hitbox with a tickle gun.","

"02/18/2018 03:29 AMPosted by LafMy real issue is that he can’t heal tanks well at allWell yeah, that's kinda his big weakness.But to be fair, what other weakness does he really have ?He's faster then Tracer, more mobile then Genji, has crazy good self sustain if you know when to amp up, and if he has all of his team around him - he out HPS Ana or Mercy without even needing to Amp up.Even his damage is decent now - a full hit of headshots + melee + boop can burst down a 200 HP hero.He's not really a good pick for a solo healer if your team is Tank Heavy, that's true - but on a team that is less heal intensive (I.E, you've got a Hog as a tank) you're gonna do fine more or less.","

"I started playing him too last night and he is a blast to play.Yes, I was having issues at first with maybe 3K match heals but towards the end of the night I was getting 6-7K'ish(of coarse length of match plays a role).  Maybe with more practice I'll get higher.I noticed the tank healing issue at times.  One thought is that his heals could be based off of a proximity box.  Stick to the tank like glue and he heals a lot quicker?  Outside that proximity box and things heal as normal.","

"The issue is more with the map design of Junkertown as opposed to Bastion. People try the pirateship here and there on other maps, but it is easy to break with a smart engagement (e.g. on Route 66 first point defense), thanks to the map allowing for it. If you get the Bastion off the cart literally once, you've beaten it. If they try to force it when the cart has rolled up far enough already - they are essentially throwing. (Since the walk from spawn to cart will be too long).I have had good success on Junkertown playing a Hog on defense. I've gone on a flank and hooked the Bastion (or Mercy) from the right side house, before they have set up (but not showing myself too early), and getting that initial kill while still having the access to the cover of that house if need be. Their team will sit on the payload and push it for a little bit before they are taken out in the teamfight, which ideally makes their subsequent setup really hard since the travel to the cart is longer and your team can play corners better without them pushing the cart.Of course there's other ways, but yeah.","

I can see where it may seem unbeatable. But it isn't. It's a team effort to do it. It takes more than YOLO trickling to break it.

"Hero experience and proficiency aren't taken into account when the matchmaker assembles teams, and this is a big problem.  We might have a single SR/MMR score but the unfortunate fact is we don't play all heroes at the same level.BTC does a great job of summing up the biggest issue in matchmakinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtMr1IjQ_E4&t=345s (go to 2:18)I don't quite agree with his proposed solution as it seems too complex for this game and would require overhauling the player experience.What I think instead should happen is, when the system is putting a team together it looks at the heroes each player can play at or near their level.  It then filters out problematic team compositions based on this and doesn't let them form in the first place.  The matchmaker system needs to ask itself one simple question before it commits players to a match, ""Can these guys put together a workable team?""Is it about to put 2 Mercy one-tricks in a team?  NOPE, pull one out and swap in someone else.  5 DPS-only players?  Pull 3 of them out and put them back into the pool.  (You could at least swap them for one of those Mercy one-tricks from the other game!)Tired of playing your hero, want to switch and don't want the system to assume you're permanently a D.Va main?  Play alternate heroes in quickplay and improve your stats on them.  Then when you queue up for a competitive game, the system knows you're good on heroes X, Y and Z, and takes all of them into consideration when it puts teams together.","

A good example is, How often are you in a game and someone clearly is not good at what they are playing but wont switch? I would love to see an option to OPT OUT of games that will have grouped people in it.

"I really feel that instead of changing RP entirely, all they need to do is look at DF as a combo character, instead of a one-shot character. Somewhat like this:-Rocket Punch: wall damage changed from 50-150 (depending on charge) to 25-50. When hitting a wall, the enemy is stunned from 0.5s to 1.25s depending on charge.-New addition to his passive: when hitting an enemy with an ability, the cooldown of the other basic abilities is reduced by 1s / 1.5s.With this changes, he becomes a character that is able to use more his abilities and combo them. He would also have more survivability, because of the extra mobility and shields he would get. He wouldn't one-shot people anymore (except Tracer), but he would have the reward that is stunning the enemy and being able to finish him off with his gun or other ability. The fact that he wouldn't one-shot ppl would also make it easier to increase a little bit the hitbox on the punch without causing an uproar on the crying babies of this community. Much better overall, more fun and less frustrating to play against. In addition to this, if he happened to be too strong, just reducing the damage on his Uppercut or SS slightly would be enough. Also, his ultimate should reset the CD on his basic abilities, or atleast activate the passive.","

The problem is, it gives a small push, its and ultimate that doesn't really do much. You yell I WILL WATCH OVER YOU and then you watch as your team dies if even one enemy uses an ult.-It lasts too long so it can't be buffed without becoming over powered.-It automatizes her teams hp management -Its healing is substandard for an ultWhat I'd like to see is either1. Reset cooldown on res, no other changes to res, no lowered cast time, no double charge, only reset the cooldown on res.or2. Increase healing/damage boost the closer she is to an ally.

Remember Platinum is still above average.Obviously further nerfs is something we all want to avoid. If she were to revert, I'd want to keep a lot of the positives of the rework with her, and try and avoid a full revert. I don't want to bring back the days of hide and seek Mercy, ""Kill her 1rst or kill her 11th"", and the old rezzing an entire team from the next room over.I propose:Ultimate (Rez) gets a cast time and a LoS requirement.New ability is Valkyrie, granting Mercy the ability to fly on her own and increasing the speed of her guardian angel.OR Valkyrie could chain heal or damage boost. When healing, the first target is healed for a higher HPS.Even if my ideas end up being bad or poorly balanced, I'm still afraid I have to side with the people that want her reverted. You can't balance a 30s rez without nerfing her into the dirt, and I don't think that's a situation anyone wants.","

She would still have the extended beam and GA-reach, but she would have to actually fly to the bodies to rez them, making ""hide n rez"" impossible and easily countered by either focus fire or an ult like Tac-Visor or High Noon.Her new E could be a high jump (similar to Pharah's rocket jump, but slower) with a small knockback that Mercy could use to get to high places (and boop unfortunates off cliffs), while split beams are put on her reload key and on a fairly high cooldown (15 seconds or more).

Enabling her to heal allies in danger even faster while potentially damaging the enemy going after them at the same time.Valkyrie though? It just gives you the ability to fly and make your general gameplay have a chain effect. It lacks the focus other ults have which results in everything being diluted.

						Feb 18
					",,,,,,,
"I'm not a Mei main, but i've put a lot of time into her over the past couple months. A big thing is working on those headshots with alt fire. Anyone can hit a frozen target, but if you can land one on someone pushing the supports, they're gonna back off. Tracer especially will have to be careful around you, because you can 1-shot her.If you're gonna ult, stack your freeze from your primary on Zarya first (So she cant save anyone else), then worry about heroes with Mobility. If you can stack it on Orisa then great, but if she's got fortify then there's really no point in trying. Make a habit of breaking walls quickly when using them to get to higher places, as if you die they're stuck there the full duration of the wall.Oh, and you can wall off Torb Turrets and Super chargers (as in placing the wall directly on them, not just in front of them) to stop them from functioning. (You can just use your primary fire to freeze a turret, but the wall is faster and safer, especially during molten core)One more thing: As far as I know, Mei's wall does NOT block her ultimate's LoS. So you can surprise people by throwing your ult at your wall where it cant be eaten by a defense matrix.Edit: As of right now, Moira orbs still do go through Mei walls, so just be aware of that when you wall yourself in somewhere on low HP. A Moira orb may just materialize and kill you if you don't have cryo-freeze available","

"I had put some time on mei too although im a Dva main. I can give some suggestion about habit.1.) Always use icicle as primary damage rather than secondary, because i saw a lot of mei player try to use freeze spray to chase down enemy but got themselve kill instead.2.)Wall is ur most important skill during war#teamfight. Walling off tank and other during choke point, while walling dont aim for ground but aim for side or top of door it will reduce mistake of walling too far or too close.3)Wall can cancel junkrat trap so always try to use it when trapped.I got more minor tips on mei's habit if you wish to discuss with me. you are welcome to add me.","

"<--- Top 50 Mei player w/ 200+ hours in MeiMei is a hero that needs her team to play around her, much like other niche heroes. She works best in deathball compositions (deathball meaning you have a 2 2 2 including Reinhardt and Lucio).First and foremost, do not be trigger-happy with your Ice Wall. People will try to sneak round corners and then quickly pull back in order to bait it out of you, which you do not want.On certain maps such as the Numbani point A upstairs choke point, you can get the enemy suck in the ceiling, which is actually ideal, because they're completely immobilised before you've even frozen them.If you feel that you're too far away from the enemy to get a good Ice Wall in, then save it. There's nothing worse than a wasted Ice Wall.Your cryo-freeze should mainly be used to bait out CC abilities such as Roadhog's hook, McCree's flashbang, etc when you find yourself in a 1v1 scenario. There is however a bug which causes Mei to sometimes be pulled out of cryo-freeze by these CC abilities, which gives you an even smaller window of time to predict when they're going to try and stun you.Mei's ultimate is best used for zoning, since it can cover entire objectives. It takes 3 seconds to freeze people, but can be sped up slightly by stacking with your primary fire. Try to steer away from using your ultimate when your Ice Wall is on cooldown. You can wall off the side of the ultimate that the enemy is closest to, to minimise their chances of escaping.It's possible to achieve a 10 second freeeze by freezing someone, and then dropping your ultimate straight to the floor as soon as they're frozen. With the Mei buffs on the PTR, you no longer have to completely freeze the target with your primary fire to achieve this.When you eventually find yourself against another Mei, it mainly comes down to who is more accurate with the primary fire, and who starts freezing the other first. If you start freezing first, you will force out their cryo-freeze. You can use this time to reload, as they have to remain inside their cryo-freeze long enough for the slow effect of your gun to wear off. Before they come out of their cryo-freeze, start using your primary fire on them. By doing this, you will be the first to start landing the primary fire again, giving you the advantage. When you headshot her, make sure to melee immediately afterwards to finish her off, since Mei has 250HP. The same applies to Reaper.","

I'm not proud of it. But the dumbest reason for someone to throw comes from yours truly. I dont know why i threw this game...maybe Because it happened multiple times in the last few months on comp.The reason I threw was because my team refused to communicate. Hold up I make it bad.Every game I joined someone had a mic (I know how lucky) But they never used it. Unless someone on my team also had a mic. I did but it chose when it wanted to work. This kept pissing me off game after game if we win they said nothing. But they complained if we lost.One game someone had a mic but they weren't using it. Even though there was six people in the chat. Then a miracle happened. My mic started working so i could communicate with them. They communicated back. Then my entire team put in there nice and started doing callouts. I dunno why I got triggered but I did and left them to 5v6. They apparently lost thanks to a message from a teammate.I feel bad about it and this is the only match that I have thrown. Please don't ban me:(,"

"Anchor Tank is the official definition for Reinhardt and Orisa, which partially corresponds to what we call ""main"" tanks. Together with Winston, a dive tank, we have only 3 primary tanks (4 if you want to count D.Va), which makes the situation a little stagnant. Winston in particular is by far the preferred choice in the current meta. Regardless of the next hero's identity, be it Junkertown Queen, Hammond, Liao or Mama Hong, I seriously hope it's going to be an Anchor tank with an anti-dive AoE knockup of sorts. After all he / she is rumored to be meta-changing, so it has to be a Winston / D.Va counter.","

Some people want a defense character just because we haven't had a new one since release, but true defense characters are hard to balance. Look at Bastion, Mei, and Torbjorn. Hanzo, Junkrat, and Widow are more offensive than Doomfist even is.But basically it boils down to their being about 16 dps and only 6 tanks, and 5 healers. We could always use more tanks and healers, the more there are, the more tank and healer mains there should be which is good for the game.","

"Before you start trying to attack me, it is not the reason you think. The reason I do not ship Tracer and Widow is because of one small headcanon I have: Tracer knew Widow before Talon got to her. Now you may be saying what does that have to do with anything? Well sit down my friends while I tell you a story.According to the Wiki Lena (Tracer) joined Overwatch in its early days and the age of 25 or 26 to be a test pilot for them. Then all the stuff with the supersonic Jet happened and Lena became - quite literally - a woman out of time.Now before we go any farther, let’s look at Amélie (Widow). Her bio says she is 33 but it isn’t that hard to assume that whatever is keeping her heart from doing its job may have also have stopped her from aging. We also don’t know when she was kidnapped but I suspect it was within 10 years Overwatch being founded. To be honest I have nothing to back this theory up other than that my gut tells me it was when the world still viewed Overwatch as amazing.So, with Tracer being established as one of the central agents and her proclivity for getting in people’s faces, it isn’t that hard to imagine that there would be a connection there.Now, if you don’t know Widow’s lore this is the short version: she gets kidnapped, brainwashed, “rescued” by Overwatch agents, and then murders her husband two weeks later. Overwatch thinks that the story is Talon came and murdered her husband and kidnapped Amelie again and has no idea where she is.Since I’m done with the lengthy backstory, let’s get into it.  Any good young adult knows the best food is free food. Tracer, I believe would be no exception to this. So with the wonky side effects from being disassociated with time, I believe she would probably hang out with / mooch off of her co-workers. And who better to mooch off of than a young married couple in their early thirties who are sympathetic to Lena’s case? No one that’s who. So years later, when Lena is practically another member of the Lacroix family, Amélie gets kidnapped and you know what happens after. After seeing the death and disappearance of the two family members, Lena begins to hate all forms of death and vows to do her best to never take a life. (Remember the game is non-canonical. Also if pay attention to both the Alive and Museum trailers, Tracer is never trying to actually hit. In Alive especially, it is obvious she is buying time.) You can see the anger on her face when Widow succeeds in hitting her mark.However, why does it turn to horror? Is it because of the fact that  it is a really unsettling laugh? Maybe so. But then why didn’t she fight back at all? Was Widow to fast for the girl who controls time?I think it was something more.I think in that moment her face changed to one of horror because she knew that face. Lena remembered the smell of pizza and the sound of laughter echoing through a small apartment. Of countless games of monopoly. Of Uno, poker, any game really. And of a young woman who loved her husband enough to deal with the chance of him never returning from the fight but knowing that he was doing it to make a better world for everyone including her. A young woman who make the best pastries Lena had ever tasted. A woman who was always super competitive and had an evil chuckle that both Lena and Gérard loved to imitate. A young woman who never failed to send Lena off with a breezy “Adieu, chérie”. A young woman Lena had spends months of sleepless nights searching for. A young woman who she finally found. A young woman who pretended it was business as usual. And the young woman who disappeared again.The young woman who would be Tracer’s biggest regret is staring her in the face and Lena hasn’t even recognized her. Remember the line from towards the beginning of the Alive trailer? Tracer says something to the effect of “Here to crash another party love?” This isn’t the first time they’ve met. I’m sure that even with Overwatch gone Tracer is still trying to prevent what she can. Since Widow likes to go around ventilating heads, I’m sure she’d be high on the priority list. And now she figures out that the woman who she has been trying to find any trace of is here in front of her but completely different.So I don’t think that Lena and Amélie would at any point form a romantic relationship. They might become friends again but that is unlikely because of how distorted Amélie has become and how much pain and guilt Tracer would go though just seeing her again. Also - though I haven’t confirmed this myself - Widow remembers enough of Gérard to call for him occasionally when rezed by Mercy. IN CONCLUSION:	Do I have any evidence for my theory/headcanon? Not for the bulk of it.	Do you have to like what I say? Nope.	Do I read way too much into the lore of this game? Most definitely yes,	Do I think I’m right? I very much hope so. But more than anything else I want to think that Tracer had a family. Maybe not by blood. But I want to think that she was the annoying younger sister to a group of people who loved her. Because I’m sure she had a terrible bout of PTSD after all she went through. 	So a young couple invited her over for pizza and Monopoly.Nothing was the same again.Welp that’s enough of that. Sorry for the long read and any feels this might have caused. I’m gonna go hang out in the corner now with the rest of my headcanons. Feel free to ignore me completely.","

"Damn, I've been uploading a chapter by chapter fanfic (no erotic contents) about the events leading upto the Slipstream failure and Amelie being kidnapped, and it's based on the exact same premise as yours. Here's the link and  summary: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12081678/1/Slipping-Through-The-FingersGerard Lacroix is heading an investigation that may lead to Talon, a mysterious terrorist organisation. Overwatch command has placed young Lena Oxton in the care of the Lacroix couple, and the three soon develop a family like bonding. Lena, a dull lonely girl, starts to regard the Lacroix couple as brother and sister and learns to enjoy her life day by day. One of the founding member of Overwatch, Gabriel Reyes, believes Jack Morrison is taking Overwatch in a wrong direction. In the meantime the Slipstream, a very expensive and highly publicized project, approaches its milestone.There's an error with your age calculation, though.The game is set 5 years after Overwatch disbanded. Lena Oxton is 26 presently which means she was 21 when OW disbanded.At 21 she was already a gun totting field agent with the time thingy on her chest. The OW HQ was blown up when she was 20 and I don't think any organisation would run a project the scale of Slipstream when their HQ is blown up. So Slipstream incident must have already happened when Tracer was younger than 20 years old. Again, I assume OW would not let a minor to testpilot a prototype time travelling airplane, so we can guess that Tracer was picked by the Slipstream project when she was 18 or 19. I'd go with 18 because it gives enough time for her to pilot the Slipstream, get lost in space and time, come back, have the thingy on her chest installed, and operate as a field agent. A lot of life changing !@#$s happening within 2 years.","

"Something else I would like to add. The reason some people don't mind back filling is probably because they don't experience it often. If this change were added, then the number of matches people who didn't have back fill disabled on, would see an increase in the number of matches they get back filled into, since other people have  now avoided it.","

That implies that backfilling really is something no one likes to do?Also there is the xp penalty system as mentioned previously, which works in deterring most people from leaving too many games.I don't mind backfilling from time to time, but I would like to mostly be able to play games from the beginning, y'know? I'd like my arcade time to look like something other than queuing for a minute to lose a game after 30 seconds.That's why I said some players mind it and some don't. Those who don't mind it could have this option turned on, those who do mind it could turn it off. Would you suggest something else to prevent this backfilling issue, like increasing the xp penalties or adding some other type of penalty for consecutively leaving games?

"The worst part about backfill is that it normally happens 10 seconds before the end of the match, and the enemy team has a huge snowball going. You've definitely lost.What then happens is the whole of your team will leave at the end of the match, and you'll most likely be forced to requeue.","

"While I do agree that backfill currently is extremely terrible, I don't think it should be disabled. If that happened then when someone ragequits you might as well too, because nobody is coming to fill that empty slot. I think the bonus should be granted based on time. If you backfill a match at the start of a game, then you get a small backfill bonus + match XP. However, if you join into an embarrassing stomp with 10 seconds left, then you get a massive backfill bonus. Maybe even give the backfiller the XP of the quitter.","

"I don't play much Reaper, but from what I can tell he's about as underpowered as Mei, and they are giving Mei minor buffs so Idk why Reaper wouldn't get any. -Increase his speed in wraith form by a bitWhy? Because it is incredibly easy to just chase him down if he doesn't get any healing. An increase in speed could allow him an escape or a better chance to find either some healing or his teammates.-Decrease the time it takes him to teleportWhy? When he teleports there are 2 seperate moments where he becomes a sitting duck and can easily be headshot by a number of weapons. Decreasing the time it would take for him to teleport would decrease the total time he is a sitting duck and the likelihood of him getting killed or very damaged. Its not an amazing ability in the first place so it probably shouldn't be countered so easily.They could put this on the PTR and see how it plays out. I'll try to imagine a number of reasons as to why they have not done this yet:A. They are still brainstorming ways to buff Reaper and they aren't quite ready to share them yetB. Their focus is on other heroes right now, Reaper is farther down the listC. They don't think Reaper is really underpowered, just that the meta doesn't favor himD. Their data implies that Reaper is fine how he is, so they would need more community feedback to sway them to look at potentially buffing himE. Something else entirely. Its most likely E or a mix of different things, but it was fun to think up these scenarios lol","

I really hate all the arcade gimmicks. I just want to play the regular game. So naturally weekly lootboxes are only rewarded for winning arcade games....This is really ruining the game for me. After I suffer through all the arcade matches I am just burnt out on the whole game and don't even want to touch it until I have to do it again next week.This needs to stop. Either make it so I can get the lootboxes in quickplay and comp or make it so both wins AND losses count so I am not stuck doing this BS all day long if my luck is bad.This seriously needs to be fixed,"

"There's no rush. You get a week to do them. Play your QP and comp games first, and then hit a few arcade games before you log off. Leave the arcade games until the end of your play time to avoid the burn out. Do the same thing everyday and you'll eventually get all the wins way before the week is done. I do 1 arcade game to 3 QP games. So if I play for an hour or two, I'll usually get 2-3 arcade wins per day.","

It had a huge pay off- yes. But it’s capacity to work was largely on darchig people out of place, or placers with slow reactions. The thing with rocket punch is nearly EVERY hero doomfist can KO with rocket punch- has a direct means to avoid dodge disrupt block interrupt or otherwise ruin rocket punch over and make it not work. And these are all things they can do AFTER doomfist begins his wind upThings important to keep in mind about rocket punch:It takes a minimum second to full charge the ability. It’s range and damage are based on that charge time. It slows doomfist to a crawl while charging and holding the ability.While altering his posture, lowering his head making it easier to land critical shots against him And makes him glow like a Christmas tree. And he screams like an autistic child in the middle of a REEE moment- it’s one of the loudest abilities in the game that lets you HEAR not only that he’s charging the ability, but let’s you know EXACTLY where he is while doing it. The majority of its damage requires him to knock you into terrain Specific terrain- as not all surfaces with work. And at specific angles. Because if it’s too wide of a shot, it also won’t work. And if the day happens to be a day that end in a “Y”, the doomfist player is required to roll a D20 against a picked at random skill check value to get the bonus damage. And the ability can not be aimed on a vertical axis Instead doomfist can only fire it on the horizontal.All coupled to the largest DPS hero in the game. With absolutely the most hard counters. So even when the hit box WAS generous- the ability was not not that powerful. Slam and uppercut combos to secure take downs were still the best bets- with RP best suited for escapes. The “problem” for RP- is its one of those things that frustrates poor play, and suffers against good play (like stealth characters in MOST games).  RP could “quickly” KO a player who didn’t know how to react to it. But against good players who DID? Game sense went (and still goes) a long way against doomfist. Being aware of your surroundings, and simple positioning with your team and it’s tanks are the biggest. Heroes run at 5-6 mps From the time he starts winding up. You have a literal 10-12 meter bubble of mobility you can use to reposition and break LoS. Be it terrain, or a team mate. Even hog suddenly makes a great meat bag nody blocking tank.If you can’t get around that- use your abilities. Seriously everyone has one short of like zen, even ones that seem odd. There’s obvious ones like reaper going into shadow form, Mei blocking or walling. But even odd ones- junk rat (who is also a hard DF counter, largely because of this), can toss a trap when he hears the sound. That trap will place and arm before DF can fire- and it’ll catch him. This is true for all hero’s who place things, I’ve literally seen symmetras drop a turret on the ground- and DF plowed into that. Emphasizing again these are all things they can do reactively. Rocket punch should NOT be difficult to land. It ALREADY has more draw backs than ANY other ability in the game for the most part. That’s NOT to say it needs to be the size of a freight train, but for the most part of you get hit by RP, even at launch- it was largely your fault. Doomfist is omen of those heroes (ok, like most) where if you have trouble with him you’d be benefit BIG time from playing as him to see and learn how to play against himThis wasn’t largely why I picked him up originally. It’s the same for many heroes on my list- such as tracer and Genji. I found I liked his kit so he’s me most played now overall, but I still have more hours OFF him than on him. These are all things I do often to ruin his day when I play against him. So take it with a grain of salt.","

"Rocket Punch is:Mobility, allowing Doomfist to quickly travel 20+ meters on a short cooldownA stun that goes through barriers, useful for interrupting enemy abilities and ultimatesA potential one-shot, if you can line it up with terrain A combo tool, letting you get a quick 50 damage out at close range and setting the enemy up for an easy finisher with your Seismic Slam + Uppercut combo.It isn't as buggy as people think it is.

Similiar to last year, but this time it takes 1 second or less and can take damage during pick up. My reasoning is this will make it more of a team effort to pick up the flag instead of someone swooping in grabbing it during the chaos of the defense fighting off the offense when they go for the flag. You have to work together to get it. The only time this isn't applied is in sudden death.Just my thoughts on the matter.","

I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers.

"02/18/2018 02:27 AMPosted by DløadMy friends were really curious about overwatch because of my stories. They joined this free weekend to try it out. They were not amused by the toxic community. As I played with them every game (after the first two) had a (genij) smurf wrecking my newb friends and after winning they started provoking. My friends did not enjoyed the overwatch experience. I tried to convince them that these were smurfs, but that would not hold back their decision for leaving the game. I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers. As the matchmaking queue takes an average of 4 minutes(including skirimish), which is long if you compare it to other games.Oh well, I guess your friends will just have to play some other FPS game where there is no such thing as smurfs...you know...as soon as a game like that actually exists.I would also wager a bet that not all those ""smurfs"" your friends were tearing up about were actual smurfs. You know...Overwatch isn't really a hard game to pick up. Some people, have been playing games like this since the original Quake son.","

"Just to let you know, I have posted this idea before.  But for some reason, I couldn't delete my post on a certain thread.  So this will be the second time I posted the same thing.I thought of a very rough concept a a while back on how Symmetra can increase her and her team's survivability with shields. But I didn't think it would really fair well enough on PTR. Even if it was tweaked a bit. So I thought that I should lay my rough concept here and see what you guys think. Remember Symmetra's old ability Photon Shield? How about bringing that back but rework it as a Passive Ability? Let's say for now it's called Photon Field. In short, have Symmetra technically act as a mini Shield Generator. It still works like the old, but less of a chore. Speaking of which, I'm certain that one of her utilities needs a change, but the one that I see that needs one for the time being is:Photon ProjectorFor starters, her Photon Projector may need a nerf but not by decreasing the beam's length. Rather, when the beam is out of range, decrease its extended time by half or more....And that's basically it from my point of view. Now describing the Photon Field. Have it work in conjunction with the Photon Projector and her Ultimates. What I mean by that will sound very complicated. But I still like to here your thoughts on it:Photon FieldWith Photon Projector: Within 5 meters from Symmetra, when the Photon Projecter reach maximum, her team gains 25 shield health.With Teleporter: Only when her Photon Projector is at maximum, all allied hero that passes through Symmetra's Teleporter gains 50 shield health. With Shield Generator: If Symmetra is alive when the Shield Generator is destroyed, all allied heroes within 10 meters gains 25 shield health.Pros: Unlike Photon Shield, Symmetra doesn't have to continuously give her team shields one at a time. Unlike her Shield Generator, the meter rule does not apply to Photon Field.Cons: In general, Symmetra needs to be alive for her team gain shield health bonuses.Photon Field does not stack with Ultimates.That's what I had in mind a while back. But again, it is a very complicated concept that I don't think it could work in the PTR. But I would like to hear what you guys think about this.","

"Given that she has been slowed down, lost 3 rez charges in total these past months, beaten, witch hunted, nerfed, reworked, gutted and the lot, would it be so bad if her now only 1 rez was instantly casted?For me, the main thing that makes Mercy unfun to play as at this point is her lack of feeling like you make an impact, and the consistent interruption of fluid gameplay that is her staple-to-the-floor resurrect. Making her resurrection instant at the least makes for smoother gameplay, and I don't feel it would make her much better pickrate wise because A), she still lacks utility and offers minimal contributions besides healing, and B) her ultimate is still lackluster compared to other Support heroes.And with this, it would even return to the 1.0 times of continued movement, crossing the battlefield countless times, topping off players, micro-managing your team and all without having to stop and risk your life by being sniper candy every 30 seconds. This would be warmly welcomed by most, I'm sure.

Right now, with Mercy being slowed and having a cast time, there's much greater opportunities for interplay between Mercy and her foes.

And if they are so out of position and picked, rezzing them again would only get them killed again+puts Mercy in a bad spot momentarily.If that was the case, why was this not consistently happening when Mercy had instant resses? People complained a lot about how Rein could just charge in recklessly, die, Mercy would GA to his corpse, instantly revive him, and now there's another 500 HP tank in the middle of their team who, very likely, was able to secure a kill with his own death.Even if it doesn't work, the mechanics encouraged it. Res people as soon as they're dead because Mercy can regularly get back out. This also lead to frustrating situations where Mercy would res anyone, including people who will just die, and hey, not surprisingly, people don't like to die, wait to respawn, get ressed, and then die immediately again for another respawn. Forcing Mercy to consider the weight of ressing someone avoids a lot of these incentives, either because the res won't be worth it, or she'll die in the process of bringing someone back.Resurrect is perfectly balanced where it's at. Mercy now requires coordination and positioning -- key skills, mind you -- to bring someone back from the dead, much like the killer of that ally had to work to bring that enemy down. Instant res just isn't healthy, and there's a very good reason why no other video game of this genre has instant revives. It almost always requires one player to be disabled and vulnerable for a brief period while bringing the teammate back. That system works for a very good reason and it's only natural Overwatch would adopt that for Mercy.","

They only take -5 damage against armor.Increasing his damage by 10% on bodyshots only doesn't affect TTK or HTK, so it's also a useless buff quantity.Buffing McCree is probably down to his mobility more than anything about his gun.  He's just so damn slow, and this can be really punishing if he's caught out of position by a fast moving comp.On the other hand, increasing his mobility means he needs to take a damage penalty, because he can't 1v6 a la Pine or Linkzr and be able to combat roll everywhere like he's praising the sun 24/7.","

02/18/2018 12:06 AMPosted by LesstoxicHow would you buff our walker Texas ranger? Personally id give him roll with 2 charges and have his ult be able to be cancelled without losing ult charge but give it a 10 sec -15 sec internal cd if its cancelled so you don't get spammed with *its high noon* ALSO you only get 1 free bluff so it must be consumed on the next use.I would not buff him,"

- 6 second Roll,"

"Lower the cooldown on Roll since its the worst movement ability in the game and it's only utility is reloading his Peacekeeper, but the reload isn't even that long anyway","

"02/18/2018 12:13 AMPosted by SplenectomyI wouldn't. In a thread a while back someone asked what McCree's role was and Jeff responded with a twitch clip of Pine.McCree can be a better DPS than Soldier and can beat Tracer and Genji in a 1v1, you just need the skill to do it.Yes. You need way more skill than the enemy Tracer and Genji has, to beat them. And McCree supposed to be their counter. Niceeeeeeee.BTW I would give his flash bang bigger hit time register. It is annoying when Tracer come out of stun cuz of s*** internet. This would make it more reliable. And make it explode when it hits the target.And reduce roll CD.","

"Hello there!Just watched the dev update and immediately had an idea what could Hanzo get in the future:in the Dragons video you can see him grab someone with his bow from behind and knock him down to the ground ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ&t=77shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ&t=293s ).Wouldn't break the lore and would help him against flankers while he could be a bit more agressive, sneaky flanker if played that way.Hope you like the idea :)","

It's just the thing that I can't take people seriously at all who think that Roadhog aka Reaper 2.0 with self heal, 3x the HP and a stun is a balanced hero.","

"Note: Not complaining, being salty, or trying to out anyone. Just thought this was a funny moment/example of some of the interesting people to be found while playing.Attack round 2nd point of HanamuraDown 2 teammates, waiting for them to respawn so we can group up and push together.Soldier sprints towards the right entrance of point B, alone, and pushes inStill waiting for team to respawn/group upSoldier dies alone instantlyA voice starts yelling in team chatSoldier: ""OH MY GOD MERCY YOU'RE SO BAD."" Me: ""You solo pushed?"" Soldier: ""I'M LETTING YOU KNOW YOU'D BETTER STAY OUT OF COMP."" Me: ""Bro you solo pushed.""  Soldier: ""GOD YOU'RE SO F<profanity>ING BAD. IF YOU'RE PLAYING IN QUICK PLAY AND POCKETING A DOOMFIST YOU REALLY NEED TO STAY THE F<profanity> OUT OF COMP."" Me, not even barely 'pocketing' a Doomfist: ""My man you solo pushed and died.""I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that it was my fault you made a stupid decision. I'll try to do better in the future.","
