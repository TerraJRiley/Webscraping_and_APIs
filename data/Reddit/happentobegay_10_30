How was your Valentine's Day?,"Mine wasn't anything too special. I'm currently single, and that stinks, but I weathered it well. My fag hag had some sort of breakdown, so she came over after work to chill and unwind. I smoked, played some *Magic: the Gathering,* and watched *Futurama* with her and she peaced. Then one of my roommates came up to chill for a bit, and I passed out on top of my bed, clothes and all. I woke up at 5AM, still stoned, took off my jeans, crawled back into bed, and woke up this morning not really mourning the fact that I was single on Valentine's Day.

How do your parents feel about your significant other? Are they coming with you for the holidays?,"My Fiance isn't coming to my parents' with me for Christmas or Hannukah (we celebrate both). It's not that he was asked not to; it's a decision we made. We just got engaged and my mother isn't thrilled. She hasn't said anything bad about it (she knows better than that), but she is visibly not happy. She didn't ask what the ring was like, or what time of year, or any of the normal ""My son is getting married"" questions. So I told her that we were giving her time. I told her I wasn't mad, that I know she is trying to deal. But we are very happy, my brother is estatic, my father is happy, it's just her and we don't want her involuntary *looks* to interfere with our happiness. She is officially on notice. She said she doesn't want this to effect our relationship and I told her that's why I'm doing this. I'm giving her time, but if she doesn't get over it, she will miss out on her first born's wedding. Wish me (her) luck.",happentobegay

Love all your non-stereotype stories! But I really do not want this to turn into a /r/LookHowNonStereotypicalWeAre. I am afraid that will get old fairly quickly.

When Cuschoolie1 and I came up with the idea, it was more of a place for us to talk about things, whatever we want without being limited to gay topics. Only talking about our deviance from the homosexual norm kind of goes against what brought us all here.

So, here are some of the types of posts I had in my head when this idea came about:

*This funny thing happened to me today
*Looking for a good book, any suggestions?
*What do other people think about ________
*Maybe some rage comics
*Advice needed

Please do not think I am trying to stifle anything. We can talk about stereotype issues, we can even talk about how hot we think a guy/girl is. I just do not want stereotypes (ether their presence or lack of presence) to dictate the contents of this subreddit.

One told me to be strong, because he'd been with his partner for like, 20 years or some shit, and just to hold on.

365 Days to stop being a shitty human being.,"Hi All,
I've been a lurker for a while now, and thought now is the time. I've been unhappy with myself (not in a bad way), I don't want to grow old regretting that I wasted any time in my life being a dickhead, sitting by watching my life passing by me.    
    
So, I decided to do a project on me. I am giving myself one year to stop being a shitty human being. I am going to document it via YouTube so I can look back on what I have done.    
    
I've seen how supportive this community is, and I hope that extends to me. I'd love for you all to watch and give me any feedback, comments, suggestions.
