I just wanna have a chill time playing video games with my friends without them explaining everything to me.,"No matter how much experience and hours I have in a game (I have 1000+ in some), people I meet still feel the irresistible urge to start explaining everything to me.

No matter how many times I say ""I know"", they just keep going. They find all these different things to explain to me as if I'd never heard of what they're saying before. Urgh.

One time when I was playing Runescape, a friend of mine started explaining one of the skills to me (slayer). I've played Runescape since 2005 and have 3000+ hours logged. I felt so irritated that he somehow thought I wouldn't know the basics of a skill I've used for years.

I'm so irritated, I'm tempted to just stick to single player and not talk about games to people anymore.",GirlGamers

Multiplayer games - where to begin?,"Like many here, I love playing video games, I've been playing since forever and that's not going to change anytime soon, but...
I don't play any online multiplayer games.

When I do, it's usually a rare occurrence with my boyfriend, where I'm fully in my comfort zone and feels like more of a LAN party than online gaming.
After being subbed for a while, and seeing how cool it can be to be in an all-girl team/clan, I'd really like to find a game that I can play with other girls online! And maybe make some friends in the process :)

I've been anxious about online gaming for a very long time, mostly due to bad experiences when I was younger (girl, gaming online, I'm sure we can all relate.), and I'm aware that a lot of communities can be toxic, especially if you use mic (which I don't think I'll be doing, at least in the beginning), but I'm ready to step out of my comfort zone and try something new.

Can any of you give me some suggestions to start online multiplayer gaming? I'm aware of the popular games: Overwatch, CSGO, WoW, LOL etc. but I'm not sure which is the best for me. 

I'm a huge RPG lover, I'm currently playing through Kingdom Come: Deliverance a 2nd time because I'm so hooked to the story! I also really love world-building/creation games, like The Sims and Stardew Valley. In the past I've found open world and adventure games are fun, like DayZ and GTA V. I'm honestly up for anything- RPG's, MMO's, Fantasy, or a plain old shooter. Something social where I can feel more connected to people!

Wholesome experiences with other girls in games,"This happened a while ago but I just remembered it today and thought maybe some people might appreciate it.. If anyone else has similar stories please share!!

&amp;#x200B;

So I was in a competitive Overwatch game and there was this duo on my team - a guy on dps who was shot calling, and a girl on Dva who wasn't talking but I assumed she was a girl because she had a girl-ish name. Anyway she was playing REALLY well on Dva and I remember thinking that to myself during the game - she saved me from their flankers loads of times (as Zen), as well as getting good ults and just generally doing really well. Near the end of the game, I got hooked by a flanking Roadhog and he would have killed me but she matrixed me immediately, saving me and enabling me to get my trans off and we ended up winning the game. After we won, her duo asked us if we thought the Dva had played well. I hadn't said anything up to this moment, but I piped up and said ""yeah she was playing really well, I actually thought that!"", so then she piped up as well to say ""oh thank you!"". Then he went on to explain that she had been practising other heroes in quickplay, but in competitive they kept getting toxic people who would see all her hours on Mercy and flame her for playing other things and it was making her lose her confidence. I said something like ""well, you shouldn't listen to them because you genuinely did so well as Dva. That matrix at the end there pretty much saved the game, so gg!"" and she was like ""thank you! that honestly means so much to me! gg!""

It was just super wholesome and made me feel all fuzzy remembering it :p

I‚Äôve never received this kind of abuse before,"I play a lot of overwatch and I‚Äôm currently in mid gold. People are generally cool and I‚Äôm a calm person in game usually. I like doing call outs and telling people good job for their kills, etc. Feels good man. 

Today I got matched with a 3 stack that was playing Reaper, Rein and Moira in comp. The Reaper was a low silver and he didn‚Äôt have a lot of hours on DPS. But what can I say? I‚Äôm mid-gold so I couldn‚Äôt judge and was like, maybe he can pull some nice picks. 

I decided to play DVA, and the other team had a pharah. I was nailing her and we were fine, but our dps had issues with killing tanks. Our Reaper kept telling me to kill the Winston (??). We won the first match, then lost the second. Our Rein called us all Idiots. 

Then, halfway into the third match our Reaper decided he needs to switch to Zarya as we were in fight and he had died flanking. He types in chat for me to get off of DVA. His teammate who was playing Rein told me I was a moron and demanded I switch while I was on point. 

I don‚Äôt usually stand up for myself but I told them no, I was doing fine on DVA, had 6 self-destruct kills and they were rude demanding that I switch without asking me. 

I get met with a barrage of insults: ‚Äúoh look she‚Äôs pmsing, you‚Äôre a terrible DVA, dumb girl‚Äù. 

And I just said ‚Äúif you had asked nicely I would‚Äôve switched, but you‚Äôre incredibly rude‚Äù. 

The Rein continued to verbally abuse me calling me fat, stupid, basically every name in the book. Someone not in the 3-stack asked him to please stop. We lost because the Zarya kept dying and then I asked them to stay for the cards. They just left. In the end I had 3 golds, silver damage and 70% kill participation. 

I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was shaking and felt kind of nauseous. In the year I‚Äôve played overwatch I‚Äôve never been insulted like that. People are usually like ‚Äúgood job guys and girl!‚Äù which is really nice. The Zarya that demanded I switch typed in main chat that I threw and someone else on our team asked the other team to report the 3-stack because they heard how they went after me. 

Just makes me feel horrible, but I won‚Äôt let it ruin my experience. Anyways, just needed to get it off my chest. ",GirlGamers

Monster Hunter live action movie already looking bad,"I've been a fan of the series since the PS2 days . Live action adaptations have never done well but after looking at the cast and hearing that Capcom would have an involvement, I was looking forward to it.

The recent [set photos](https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/movies-theatre/pics-milla-jovovich-and-ti-share-bts-while-filiming-monster-hunter-in-sa-17636288) made me lose all hope I had for it. Even the setting isn't like the game. This is what the director had to say:

&gt;The central characters are very relatable American characters. You take a person from the ordinary world who thinks they‚Äôre in a dead end job, they have no future, they feel like their life‚Äôs a failure, it‚Äôs going nowhere, like Keanu Reeves in *The Matrix*. It‚Äôs about a normal American who gets dragged into this parallel world, this *Monster Hunter* world. Then eventually the parallel world ends up coming to our world. So you have the creatures from the *Monster Hunter* world invading our world. 

So we're getting a Pacific Rim rip-off with monsters and explosions. I always felt that MH would be one of the easiest game to movie adaptations possible, and they still managed to make it sound horrible.

I'm not sure what it is with Hollywood and video game adaptations, but this is another one that I won't be watching.",GirlGamers
What's your favorite PC game for grinding cosmetics and leveling up your character?,"Hello ladies,

I'm wondering if any of you can steer me in the direction of finding a PC game (maybe on Steam) with a character creation system that allows you to grind for cosmetics (like get a cool wardrobe, sword, etc), preferably with a skill system where you can level up? Bonus points if it has controller support, whether full or partial.

I've played games like Skyrim before but it wasn't *my thing*; I usually play indie games but would like to steer out of that direction. I've also played RuneScape *forever*, so I'm used to that game inside and out, and have completionist on it as well. As for something like the Sims, I normally don't like it for anything else other than designing a nice house. And Portal Knights, I play with my boyfriend, but doesn't have many cosmetic options.

I've looked at games like ESO (but I don't like Skyrim so I don't know if I'll like it) and World of Final Fantasy (but I don't like FF but this seems different). I've played some free games on Steam like Paladins, AdventureQuest, Tale of Toast, etc. but they didn't hold my attention for long.

I usually play games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, RuneScape (3 and OSRS), Portal Knights, Town of Salem, A Hat in Time, etc.

DMing a one shot for an all male group that has been p sexist at times. Want to use their gender bias against them in my campaign and need help with ideas....,"So I'm in a small d&amp;d group thats made up of 4 dudes, and me the only girl. We are taking a break from our main campaign and all the players are taking turns DMing one shots.3 of the 4 dudes have consistently exhibited some uncool behavior.For example- in our group text I can ask a question 2 or three different times and not get an answer even though they are currently actively texting each other at the time. I have to ask the 4th dude in the group (my boyfriend) to go repeat my question in the chat for me, and he does, and they all immediately answer him.

My character is a female half moon elf  In fiction, she is very commonly mistaken for a Drow. One of the guys characters is an ex-high elf naval officer whos backstory is made up of things like gnome and halfling genocides, ""colonizing"", and ""cleansing"" etc... and his character likes to make reference to the good ol days at sea when they had ""all the drow they could rape"".

Things like that....

Its my turn to DM, and for my one shot I'm creating like a fantasy escape room kinda thing, but like... if Jigsaw was the main investor. So its full of logic puzzles, riddles, and most importantly morality puzzles. And if/when they screw up theres combat as well.

I realllllly wanna incorporate some stuff that will use their sexism against them. But, I'm having trouble coming up with exactly how.The only feminist kinda riddle I know is the ""the surgeon is a woman/his mother"" one, but I think basically everybody knows that at this point and it wouldn't work. I've thought about a puzzle of some kind where they have to match certain items to certain statues and having stereotypical woman items like a broom and baby stuff but have that not actually go along with the female statue and somehow punish them for it but again, I feel like that would be the kind of thing they'd look at and go ""oh well its too obvious which its supposed to be"" and then not fall for my trap.I think I've just been thinking about it too much and I need fresh eyes.

  
EDIT: For what its worth, I live in the bible belt. It doesn't excuse their behavior, but 99.999999% of dudes around here are SEVERELY under-educated about gender relations, and I don't believe these guys to be intentionally malicious, I believe they are simply ignorant.  
  I don't intend for any of this to really take root in them, I just wanna incorporate this kind of thing because if I figure out a good way to do it, then I know they'll fail that challenge because this is obviously a blind spot for them. This campaign is designed as a facility that tests and punishes adventurers for their hubris, so ALL of the challenges are designed to focus on each of their weak spots, I just wanted to think of one or two elements that could play off of this particular weakness.

What Part or Level of a Game Has Driven you to Damn Near Break Something or Pull Your Hair Out?,"The first thing that comes to mind for me personally is Grand Theft Auto and those cursed RC missions or ""all you had to do was follow the damn train CJ"". I remember how I played GTA V afraid that they would sneak some bs in there like that. But this post was really brought on by AC: Odyssey. 

There are these hunting missions you have to do and all of these animals are rather powerful. One of them involves this boar. This fucking boar ruined my entire night that I was playing. once I beat it, I just went to bed pissed off and as I tried to sleep, I would replay the infuriating experience in my mind, I would get even more pissed off.

Being nice turns into an obligation.,"This is a bit of a long rant. I have been gaming with these 2 guys for a long time and we have played a variety of different games (for clarity, I‚Äôm going to refer to them as A and B). They are both laid back and fun to be with. I played a few more games with A so I guess I favor A more than B at times but B talks to me more outside of gaming.

We all play Destiny together and our clan does the raid on almost a weekly basis but there is no sign up sheet or anything. We‚Äôre all adults. Raid happens when we have enough people online to go. Me and A is online every day, but A gets home from work before I do so he usually gets to raid with the clan more often since I log on later. B hardly goes to raid with the clan for a few reasons: (1) he‚Äôs not on when the clan goes; or (2) he logs on after the raid started.

Recently, B has texted me almost every day to tell me that he is available to raid when I have absolutely no control on who gets to go on the raid. Sometimes I do not make it because I log after it has started. I am not mama bear that ensure B gets a spot in the raid. I mean if I‚Äôm going and we‚Äôre missing one more person, I would check to see if B is available because I want to be nice and not because it is an obligation. I keep telling B that I have no say over who gets to go but his response is essentially to tell me to hold a spot open for him.

Second, B has been trying to upgrade a weapon but the quest is only available during the weekend. There are 2 parts to gain percentage towards the upgrade: (1) the first method is to jump through a puzzle and collect chests, and (2) kill 3 bosses at the end. Each method will grant a percentage per week. When I needed to upgrade the weapon, I would collect the chest on my own because you don‚Äôt need other people to do it with you, and if none of my friends are available to help me kill the bosses for the second part, at least I still have some percentage towards completion.

Again, me and A are online most weekends, A has helped me killed the bosses every weekend and I got my weapons upgraded while B does not log on at all. I will never ask A to come with me to collect chests because that is a waste of his time. Yesterday, while in a group chat with other clan mates, B makes a comment that insinuates it was essentially my and A‚Äôs fault for him not being able to upgrade his weapon. When he did come online on Sunday, the 3 of us spent the entire day getting a weapon that we all wanted but apparently it was still our fault for not wanting to help him upgrade his weapon.

To me, it sounds like he's just whining for the sake of whining. I need a neutral party to tell me that either I'm nuts or B is being a big baby about it all.",GirlGamers

I'm hoping that you all could point me in the direction of some good games for Ps4 that are not hyper-violent and have very little or no fan service.

What's your favorite gaming memories?,"Just got off playing a few hours of Mankind Divided (very enjoyable, have been waiting a few years to play it), and I was thinking of other games I've had good, fond recollections of. Here's a list:

-

**Skyrim:** Once I was at Dragontooth Crater, had just started playing Skyrim and while I was expecting to fight a dragon, I did not expect *another one* to randomly show up. I retreated into the watchtower and fired arrows at them until they died. I felt incredibly outmatched, but the victory felt soooooo good. Some other fond memories include defeating Karstaag on Legendary (the sneaky, stabby way) and travelling through Hermaeus Mora's realm.

-

**Mass Effect 2:** My favorite Mass Effect game. First time I played on Insanity, there's this midway stage where you head to a colony to stop the Collectors and face a group of husks plus two Reaper constructs that fired biotic shockwaves at you. I had only my trusty SMG and biotic warp (as an aside, the warp sound effect is soooooo satisfying to listen to). So I ended up running in a circle the entire afternoon in a series of attempts, killing off the husks, then the constructs, never stopping except to shoot. It was *very tiring*, and I think after I was done with that stage I called it quits for the day. The next time I did it, I had the DLC black hole gun... suffice to say it was a lot easier this time.

-

**Guild Wars 2:** I've since stopped playing this (due to various reasons, both personal and Anet-related), but I recall my first raid kill very fondly. It was the first week, and I was trying very, very hard to get my first kill -- I was dumb enough to be emotionally upset about not being able to succeed, and I think that colored how sweet my eventual victory was. I couldn't do it with my friends, so I ended up going for a PUG group and we got the Vale Guardian just before we called it quits for the night.

-

**Shadowrun: Hong Kong:** Being Chinese, it was amusing to see bits and bobs of Cantonese here and there, and the post-campaign content even has stuff closer to home (I am Malaysian). But what made it memorable was that during my second playthrough, I went with a melee elf character, who was 'augmented' Deus-Ex style, with limbs tipped with razor claws. I would often flush out enemies behind cover, rip and tear at them before letting my ranged teammates shoot them to pieces -- if they weren't already diced up. Melee combat was kinda meh in Dragonfall, so this was very welcome.

-

**Dead Space:** The entire game was a memorable experience, but what I remember most fondly is mowing down swarms of necromorphs with a pulse rifle and feeling the adrenaline. Dead Space 2's opening scene is great too!

Am I the only one who hates doing Hard dungeons?‚Äù,"I‚Äôve had a really fun time playing Maplestory 2 over the past week however once you hit 60 its all about grinding for gear right? This is where my problem comes in, I don‚Äôt really have much experience playing mmo‚Äôs like this, my only other mmo was TERA and even then I didn‚Äôt do HARD dungeons. I kind of focused more on PVPing . On top of that HM dungeons always have me feeling extremely anxious and self-conscious. I feel that I am a burden to other people because I don‚Äôt know how to run. I feel like a dead weight. Yesterday my bf and I tried running the Fire Dragon dungeon with 2 people who I found on world chat. I let them know that I was a beginner and that this would be the first time I would be running this dungeon. I was really sad because I kept dying to various mechanics ect. It ended up with them having to carry us through because we couldn‚Äôt revive anymore. After this run, I wasn‚Äôt really feeling too good about the whole experience. We were 4 dps and it was really hard for me to keep up, I feel like I‚Äôm not good at these types of games and it made me feel like maybe I should quit. Even though I felt this way I ran it a second time because I didn‚Äôt want my bf to miss out on the experience since the other two people were offering to run it again. Long story short , the second time didn‚Äôt go well either, the two guys dc‚Äôd out. I asked some questions about why buffs wouldn‚Äôt go away etc and one of them told me this was an easy dungeon and if I was dying like this that I probably wouldn‚Äôt make it in the long run basically. It really caught me off guard and I got off immediately and felt really sad about the whole thing. Anyone else have similar experiences? ",GirlGamers

It was amazing to see a fantasy world, my favourite book genre, romance, cool weapons, magic, summoned beasts and people saving the world. Games suddenly opened up into a whole new world of possibility.

I was the right age to be earning pocket money for jobs around the house and it was a great time for used games and rpgs.

Rant: Jaina's Rags and Anduin's Armor - cosplay,"[Jaina's rags and Anduin's ""armor""](https://voodoomamajujurose.tumblr.com/post/179213731173/so-the-girls-get-this-pathetic-strip-of-cloth)

Just a momentary rant on the unfairness of cool attire from the companies who make fan items.  I believe I am qualified to make this assessment as I am a maker of cosplay and historical costumes.  I am also a buyer of cool stuff.

In this case they made a very nice, quality hoodie for Anduin and Sylvannas with nice smooth seams and fine detailing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/khz15fzxv5t11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

And for Jaina Proudmoore, they made a shrug.

If you sew, this is basically a wide strip of cloth with armholes cut in it or flapped over, sewn at the sides, and sleeves sewn in.

You can see from the picture the hem is badly done, with lumps and bumps from cheap sewing.  The trim is cheap ribbon.  And it isn't really shaped well if you look at the model in it.    The least cheap thing on is the tiny badge.

So how's the romance in Assassin's Creed Odyssey?,"(I [posted this on /r/Games yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/9p7mh1/so_hows_the_romance_in_assassins_creed_odyssey/) and got quite a few answers despite downvotes. I'm curious about this subreddit's opinion though, since /r/Games tends to be an awfully cynical place most of the time)

**For context**: The last AC game I played through was Black Flag. Was a big fan of the series up and including that one, but kind of lost interest and never got past the first hour or two of Unity and haven't tried one since. 

I heard a lot of good and bad about AC:Odyssey everywhere, but I wanted to ask about the aspect that really got me interested in the game when they first announced it: romance. 
For a while, I saw tons of people say Ubisoft was kind of picking off what Bioware isn't doing anymore (but then, I've never actually played a bioware game). And I saw [this article](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/727735/Assassin-s-Creed-Odyssey-Bi-Visibility-and-a-very-different-kind-of-Power-Fantasy) and thought that sounded super cool too. 

Call me shallow, but I figured playing a decent game where I can play as a hot bi protagonist had to be cool and interesting, I'm a sucker for romance in games in general. 

However, since the game's release, I've heard relatively little about how it's actually implemented. I saw someone on /r/Gaymers call the romance scenes ""disappointing"" and I saw someone else say that it's all ""fade to black."" The latter can mean a lot of things though: I'm not really looking for awkwardly animated banging as much as I'm interested in well-written character attraction and relationships. Some sensuality is a bonus, but I'm not looking for porn here. 

So with that in mind:  
**Can anyone tell me a bit more about how well the romance is implemented in Odyssey**, preferably without too many spoilers?   

What's there to like or not like?  
 How important/significant is romance within the whole story and game?   
Do you get custom cutscenes for characters you try to hook up with or is it just select dialogue option, fade to black and then leave their house the next morning?  ",GirlGamers
So I was at the flea market a few weeks ago and there were so many of us!,"Basically it was like this: I had just bought me some games, to my left there was another woman browsing through the games left at the stand, at the stand next to this one was a young woman chatting with the guy behind it about their favourite Assassin's Creed games, and to my right there was an older woman buying a few games as well. The Guy behind this stand wished her fun with her purchase, but then said something along the line of: ""But then I guess those are for your son"", and the older woman just answered: ""Actually, they're for my daughter."" I could not help but smile. It's a bit sad that with all this exposure to women clearly interested in games the guy still assumed that she was buying them for a son, but at the same time I felt so not alone and like screaming into his face that we exist, but the world itself already just did that in a very calm manor.",GirlGamers

Good third-person games with playable female characters,"I‚Äôve been in a gaming rut lately. I‚Äôve been playing nothing but The Sims 4 and Skyrim for the past two years, because every game nowadays seems to be first person (which I absolutely loathe) or force you into picking one or more of their male protagonists or if they do offer non-male (and God forbid non-white options) it‚Äôs a horribly rendered MMORPG with graphics from 2007.

So, I recently discovered the latest AC game gives you a female option (bought it immediately after seeing that here) and now I‚Äôm wondering if there are other games I missed out on or that y‚Äôall would recommend?

I like third-person, action/adventure, character creation, RPGs, open worlds and/or just something that allows me to be a kickass woman!

We need your stories for the topic 'Being a Good Ally'!,"Hi folks,

So as you may have seen, /r/GirlGamers will be attending Twitchcon with AnyKey to be in the Twitch Unity Lounge. Part of our time at the Lounge will involve discussions and presentations on different topics.

AnyKey proposed the idea of the topic 'Being a Good Ally' and it was approved! So we'd like to get some stories from our users about times they had a friend/stranger be an ally to them in the gaming world, or things/traits/actions that they think make a good ally. Below is the email with more information:

------------

*The Twitch Unity Lounge will be at TwitchCon again this year and they are running some of their own programming about diversity and inclusion topics in the space.* 

*I suggested several topics that I thought would be cool to cover, including Being A Good Ally, which is something I've wanted to see discussed more. They agreed!*

*Here is how you can help:*

**Can you share a story with me about at time when someone was a good ally to you and supported you, as a marginalized person in video gaming?**

**Stories can be long or short!**

*Being a good ally can take many forms, so this is pretty open! It could be about someone who publicly called out a harasser and helped to turn around a negative community situation (or helped you feel better about it). Or about someone who has provided steady support/encouragement/mentorship over a period of time. Or about a time when someone said something that you greatly appreciated and made you feel seen/heard/supported, even indirectly. Or anything else!*

*One of the goals of this is to give other potential allies examples of things that have been genuinely supportive in the past. We frequently hear the question: what can I do to be more supportive or inclusive? Ideally, this session will start to provide some actionable ideas.*

*Feel free to name names if you want to. I would love to give recognition to those who are legit supporters, but I will be sure to ask them first if I want to mention their name specifically during the session.*

------------

**If you have a story, please share it by the end of the day on Friday (PST), or Monday at the latest!**

If you feel uncomfortable posting it publicly, you can also PM it to me or send it via modmail :)

Thanks &lt;3 &lt;3",GirlGamers
The way Issun acts around Rao in Okami bothers me,"Was tempted to post this in this Okami sub but thought it'd be better to put it here. I'm not the type to get easily offended but for fuck's sakes, could Issun please just shut the hell up?

So Rao is a minor female character in Okami with large boobs that hang out that also have *cough* jiggle physics (google a pic of her if you're curious). All the other female characters in the game aren't sexualized, but she's supposed to be really beautiful.

When I first saw what Rao looked like I was like, ""oh god"" at first but quickly decided to let it go. But Issun, who is one of the two main characters and ""good guys"" decided to keep mentioning her boobs non-stop. He oftens greets her with, ""oh hey it's that busty babe!"" Once even says, ""I couldn't say no to those two"" and ""haha, it's not like I said yes just because of your melons."" Rao acts like she doesn't know what the heck he's talking about when he says all this.

But yeah it just bothered me and made me uncomfortable. Issun says a lot of things to the other female characters but never anything like this (though his other comments did slightly bother me, usually calling a random girl babe or cutie-pie). The other main character Amaterasu, a wolf, whom the player can't understand but Issun can, never gets on him about it (which would've softened the blow for me). In fact I think there's a scene where even Amaterasu is staring at her breasts (I might be overthinking it but it honestly wouldn't surprise me. I'm kind of confused about Amaterasu's gender. I think they're a female goddess inhabiting the body of a male wolf).

At first Issun was my favorite character because he was gutsy and kind of care-free but once he started talking about the female characters in this regard I was like, ""annoying-ass pervert.""

Pretty sure they wouldn't put a girl character in there constantly talking about some guy's giant dick.

Oh and get this, since Issun is (if I understand it correctly) literally a bug, his obsessions all the more confusing.",GirlGamers

Does anyone have any suggestions for maybe one long desk that's a decent width as well or want to share their setup if it's a two person deal?

Shout-Out to Warhammer Total War Series,"They have these female warriors known as ""[witch elves](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8548992/0209ebc77eaa4c7fa036cfff9f92dc0fe7b4167b.png)"" and [sisters of slaughter](https://pre00.deviantart.net/58d3/th/pre/f/2018/186/3/c/total_war__warhammer_2___sisters_of_slaughter_by_telthona-dcgc3nm.png), which in design look very stereotypical and badly designed in terms of female armor.  
  
Now, you may be wondering why I'm praising this game then, on this sub. This is because of 3 reasons.  
  
1. There are males in the game that are also unclothed/sexualised (although less)  
  
2. NOT HIGH TIER ARMOR: These women are obviously wearing skimpy outfits, there's no disputing that, but they also have some of the lowest armor stat values (practically 0), meaning this is accurately reflected in game mechanics, and that it isn't some typical fantasy cover nothing but defend everything thing.

International Day of the Girl Sale On Steam - Surely this will encourage helpful and insightful discussion... oh wait this is Steam,"Edit: https://imgur.com/a/vVKohk5

Didn't realize that posting direct links wasnt allowed. But here's a few choice images of several posts. Warning, your head may explode while reading some of this. 

Some choice quotes

&gt;I ask because this reaks of ideological corruption.

Yes because a sale along a specific theme is all about 'ideological corruption'

&gt;Also, one should not care about the physical traits of the character, but how well made he or she is. 

Yet you seem to care a lot that the sale is about female protagonists....

&gt;And a last caviate, authoritarian ideologies and religions can not make good art. 

Just.... what can you even say about this? 

The only surprising thing is it took as long as 150 posts to trigger Godwins Law.


In any case here's the actual page to the sale if you want to support 'ideological corruption' and the fact that such things cannot possibly 'make good art'. Even if its not art, I guess you can still send the devs a few bucks by buying a game. All this corruption is expensive!

A female playthrough of AC: Syndicate with Evie? (and of other AC games),"I really don't like the gameplay of AC games (played the very first one and it was so repetitive, never bought another one), but I quite like to watch them being played! I've watched some playthroughs before, but not of Syndicate.

Now for some reason I get only one guy from search of YT for Syndicate and not only he doesn't play Evie much, but his commentary is really inane, and he rushes everywhere rather than play intelligently and stealthily. Now, I'd really prefer to watch a woman play this game, after all, there's an Evie option, and I don't want to miss out on it. Besides, I just generally prefer to watch women play.

Suggestions, please? I'm sure there are some women around who like AC and know someone who'd streamed it. And while I want to watch Syndicate in particular, your suggestions of other AC games recorded by women would be welcome, as well.",GirlGamers

I'm so happy Froskurinn is back on the desk at Worlds (League of Legends),"She offers really great insight and I'm so happy she's back on the desk.  I'm very excited that she's going to start working with EU because I actually watch EU LCS so I'll get to see her more regularly starting next season.  It's nice to have a girl around.  I love Sjokz and Ovilee of course but having a girl actually on the desk doing the technical talk is really cool.

Also as a WLW seeing representation for that is nice too üòä

In addition to that she always manages to look beautiful but also super unique, cool, and smooth as fuck.  One of the most exciting parts of Worlds for me is tuning in every night to see what kind of funky outfit she's wearing (and *slaying*) haha.  Girl's a fashion icon tbh.

TFW You Go into a Different Sub and the Sexism Jumps Out,"Sometimes I think I spend too much time on this sub because I get used to how things are nice and calm here. There isn't raging against female characters or some ""feminist agenda"". Since as I have been playing AC:Odyssey lately (I am loving the game) I go to the sub and some of the bs there is astounding.

Granted, a good bit deal of them do give compliments to Kassandra, such as her voice actress and how she does has some build of a warrior. Then again, you have those praising the game for not making her a "" butch man-hating lesbian"" or how she isn't too masculine and so they can still drool over her. Or how she is treated as an equal in the game is a part of Ubisoft's pandering to feminists.

[rant] respect not proportional to contributions and generally lonely,"I've been in the same core raiding group (WoW) for about a year and a half. I don't know why I feel the need to defend myself, but it's probably because I can't say anything to the people in my guild. I consistently parse high, am very competent with mechanics, contribute more-than-average to the guild bank, etc. I know my class, know my role. I listen and I'm a good friend to my guildies. I know my guild likes me, but they don't respect me. I can tell by the way I'm never promoted (my rank when our guild split/changed around a bit is on par with a person who has not raided in 3 weeks, low parsing people, and people I don't even know) and how our raid leader will refer to other healers as the main healer, when they parse lower than me and mess up frequently. 

Everyone else in my guild is a man (apart from two members wives, who do not raid). I don't face much blatant sexism and no one is unkind to me. Overall, I have very little to complain about except that it's super lonely.  A few weeks ago, my old guild split and it was essentially because two women independently caused problems. I feel like I'm on thin ice, like when I'm not there, people place bets on when I'll cause problems. Since then, I've said very little. Our old team had 3 women who raided plus me. Things felt a lot less lonely back then. I don't know, maybe I'm just experiencing that Legion nostalgia. ",GirlGamers

Black Ops4 the breakdown from my time playing the Beta!,"So if youre interested in the COD community then you know not much has changed sine MW2 (one of the best first person shooters ive played) Blops3 was a cool jump with all the new futuristic guns, but recycling old maps, and perks it gets pretty repetitive. With the BLOPS 4 Beta, so many new elements have been added and i thought id share some for anyone thinking about getting it. The Multi-player is like all in the past, but now you can heal after being shot, big game changer in my book, so now you cant just run around with a P90 collecting heads. Also theres a grappler gun to sneak up on someone, or retreat from being shot at. Sliding is also back, thank the lord because that was one of the reasons WW2 wasnt that good. You can also see enemy health so you can see how much damage you do. Of course they have new core characters with specialabilites, I didnt get to see scorestreaks but im sure theryre close to what theyve been in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Battle Royale.

Im so excited to sum it up. By far the funnest game mode to me. The BR Map is HUGE. Bringing back some of the best maps like Shooting Range, Cargo, Trainstation, Nuketown. Over all the whole map looks great. Loot was a little ify, alot of attachments for guns (which is a big game changer) and shotgun ammo lol. That was just the beta of course so im sure theyve improved it. (Let me just say, one of the most solid BETAS ive EVER played!) Armor is also in the game now (3 levels) lvl. 3 is what you want for sure.(itll be the black armour, it protects you alot.) You literally have to empty a whole clip to take off the armor. Theres healing of course, Medkits are nice but Traumakits are the way to go, bumping you up to 200HP in seconds, so if youre in a fire fight, fall back and use it before reengaging and surely youll have the upper hand. Transportation is a big change as well, you now have Trucks, Helicopters, ATVS, and boats. Personally i think the boat is the fastest getaway to zone. Theyre perks now, most of them are pretty basic and dont add much to your GP but theyre a few i really enjoyed. Deadsilence is great, it mutes your footsteps bascially so sneaking in the final zone is easy P. Paranoia warns you once someone has scoped in on you. Now attempting to sum this up, many new things like drone cars, grapplers, Darts that let you see where people are on the map beside you, it seems theyve finnaly stepped it up and finally brought change to such a great series of games. Im really excited and i recommend it to any COD fan.

"""Good job BOYS"" in team games: please stop excluding women...","I'm getting really upset with all these guys who use the words ""boys"", ""dude"", ""man"" over and over again... I'm playing Overwatch on a regular basis, and even when I'm there in voice chat (and I sound like a woman), making calls like everyone else, guys are just rewarding ""boys"". At the end of the game, you can be sure someone will be saying ""gg boys"". And it might be a minor details, just the force of habit from those guys, but as a woman it gets extremely upsetting to hear that so much. I think I heard someone say ""gg boys... and lady"" ONCE. I mean, I don't mind the quite generic term ""guys"" (English isn't my mother tongue but I think it's gender neutral? Please correct me if I'm wrong), but there are a lot of ""boys"", which is definitely masculine.I wonder if I should call them out on it, just to let them know ""hey, please don't exclude women, gg everyone"". But given the number of people who are prompt to say ""just go back to your kitchen"", I think I'd rather not take the risk... So here I am, just venting. If you have a good idea on how to reply to those countless ""boys"", or if you think I should just ignore it, please let me know!

Looking for games with romance subplot,"There are a couple of posts like this already on this sub, but they were all a bit older, so I wanted to get some recommendations. 

I would love some recommendations for games that have good romance subplots in them. So far, I have done all of the Dragon Age games, SWTOR, and KOTOR 1. I am on my first playthrough of KOTOR2. I plan on playing the Mass Effect trilogy after I finish with KOTOR2.

Ideally, I would like to find a game where romance is the sub-plot rather than the main focus and the protagonist is female. That being said, if there are any particularly compelling games with romance in them that *don't* fit the above, I am certainly open to recommendations.

If you could give me a brief non-spoilery ""why"" behind the recommendation so I know what I am getting into, that would be awesome. Thanks in advance! :)

Opinions on Overwatch community?,"Hello!!

&amp;#x200B;

I am very new to Reddit (as in, I just signed up less than thirty minutes ago, ha ha), so I do apologize if I'm not doing this right. I was just wondering what people's opinions are on the Overwatch community. I'm looking for answers along the lines of toxicity in the community, I guess. A family member recently bought me the game, and I've been wanting to play it for a long while now, but I have very, very bad anxiety that tends to flare up very easily.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not usually one to avoid environments that trigger it (for lack of a better word), but I play video games to find a reprieve from things that stress me out, and I wanted to know if other players are generally kind or not, especially to new players. Also, I'm sorry if I'm not articulating myself particularly well, as I am not a native English speaker. (But I live in America, so I have to try my best!)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess to put it concisely, do you think that the Overwatch community is welcoming to new players? For either answer, in what ways?

"Female Characters on the ""larger"" side","Hey all, long time listener, first-time caller here at /r/gamergirls!

I was wondering if any of you could possibly help me. I'm currently studying Computer Games Development at University and one of my units this year involves me creating a 3D model of a character and an environment. 

I, personally, am a woman on the larger side and, though I've heard all the excuses in the book from men I've asked in the past like ""It's an unhealthy body image, that's why its under-represented"" or ""it wouldn't make sense with the game setting or style"" and I'm honestly sort of sick of it. Unhealthy or not, it's who I am and I want to be represented, goddamn it.  

Anyways, what I'm asking for is a little help. I would like to make a female character who is on the larger side, but the problem is, I'm far from a 3D modeler, and even further from an artist. I'm here looking for inspiration. I love games but I'm aware there are huge gaps in my knowledge.

A rant (please read),"This is a two-part rant about recent events and I just need to get off of my chest with someone that can hopefully relate to me or understand.

Here's some background information first: I've been playing video games for a while now, it all started with Minecraft when I was about 12. Then when my parents got a PC I downloaded Steam and played games like Dishonored, Transistor, Shadowrun Returns. I started High school and got a PlayStation for Christmas and began playing my first online multiplayer game: Overwatch. I played alone as I didn't have any friends on PlayStation with me. Fast forward two years, I meet my current boyfriend-- he plays Xbox and for my birthday he gets me one. 
A new world is opened up to me, I never realized how different games were when you had someone to play with. My boyfriend and all our friends play now whenever we have the time (which isn't often now that we work and have college). The point is, video games aren't new to me, they've been a part of my life for about seven years now. 

Part one: Now I'm pretty average when it comes to video games, I just recently made it to diamond for the first time in Overwatch (yayyy) and I'm only Gold 2 in R6 Siege. I love playing the same games, I've been playing Overwatch for years and Siege never gets old for me, I play some new games, but I always end up going back to my favorites. My friends (all guys) on the other hand, don't play as much as me, I'm actually higher ranked than them in both Overwatch and Siege. I enjoy playing with them but I hate that they underestimate me. They always have some criticism for the way I play, and a lot of times they get aggravated if I mess something up (like a 1v2) whereas if they do the same, it's nothing. I just find it really annoying that they treat me different, it's small, but it gets to me sometimes. Does anyone else experience this with their friend group?

Part two: Now we all know that guys are thirsty on the internet, this isn't news. This fact kept me from having my gamerpicture as a picture of myself for a long time. I had pictures of Daenerys Targaryen, Jessica Jones, and Korra from LOK, but never pictures of myself. Well I recently dyed my hair black, this is the first time I've ever dyed my hair and I really love how it came out. I took a selfie a few days after and thought, ""Wow this is a great picture and my hair looks great, I think I'll put it as my gamerpicture"". Well my friends immediately begin to comment on it and scrutinize me for it, and yesterday was the breaking point. I was playing casual Siege with two of my friends when I got a party invite from some random guy. I looked at the game menu and saw that we weren't playing with him so I asked my friends,
""Do you know somebody named *his gamertag*?""
One of them groaned and the other said, ""You need to change your gamertag."" 
I said, ""what?""
He said, ""You complain about getting messages but you're basically asking for it with that gamerpicture."" 
This is where I got pissed off. I'll tell you what I basically told them: I shouldn't have to pretend to not be a girl to keep from getting nasty messages. Actually, before my gamerpicture was a picture of myself, I got messages anyway, because my gamertag is ""OverlySassy"". My name is displayed as my name, Chloe, and my color is pink, so people knew I was a girl before I even changed my gamerpic. I just found it so infuriating that instead of people not sending messages and being rude and gross, people want me to hide that I'm a girl.
Please tell me that I'm not the only one that gets infuriated by this and that someone else understands.

Lastly, thank you so much for taking the time to read this and I would love to make friends to play with so if anyone is interested, feel free to add me. I love meeting new people. ",GirlGamers

Female anti-heroes in video games,"I was discussing this with a friend recently. I've always preferred anti-heroes to heroes or villains. And while it's rare for women in fiction to be in these kind of roles, they seem nearly non-existent in games.

This is one of the reasons Nina Williams (Tekken) is my favorite female character, closely followed by Lara Croft. Both of them have saved the world on occasions but it's never been their goal. They're also willing to kill people to get what they want.

How to respond to sexist guys in game?,"So, I've been playing Overwatch since it came out. I got serious about playing competitively instead of casually a couple months ago, but I've always been too afraid to use voice chat. I want to improve, however, and I figure using voice chat is a must if I really want that. Plus I've had a couple games now where I know telling people about a flanker or a sleeping enemy would have helped the team. I ended up buying a headset this past week and plan on actually trying to use vc this weekend, but I'm nervous and was hoping anyone on here had any advice or any comebacks to shut any those guys down. I've never really had anyone be sexist towards me before, but I've read all the stories and seen some of what other girls have had to put up with and I know I'm not going to react well when someone does inevitably say stuff like that to me.",GirlGamers

So About Humble Bundle's Female Protagonist Sale...,"Am I the only  one who has mixed feelings about this? I love that they're recognizing games with female protagonists but...they included [Haydee](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/haydee). 

In full disclosure, I've never played the game personally. I watched a Let's Play of it and I've seen the screenshots.

I don't think I'd call Haydee a female protagonist...because she's not a protagonist. She's literally one of those headless female sex toys on legs (albeit with a robot head). She never speaks, she's one of a thousand Haydees. She doesn't have a face, a personality, she has no agency, no characterization. She's just an ass and a pair of tits on long legs with high heels. The top mods out there strip away the little clothing she's wearing. She's not a person. 

To put her in the same listing as Michonne, Zoe Castillo and hell, even Bayonetta who is a very sexual character but is still a person with characterization (and lets be real, she owns her sexual identity) and Amaterasu who is literally a goddess is frankly...really insulting. 

I get that they probably got permission to discount all of those games and went with the trait they had in common, being female-looking bodies. But this just... it's like its another reminder that even though you're a strong character the only thing that matters is that you have tits. 

Maybe I'm overreacting. Lord knows I'm hyper sensitive these days with all the 'we don't want no WAHMEN/femoids/feeeeeeemales in our vidya!' types I see on a daily basis. But idk.

Does anyone else have any feelings on the matter? ^^also ^^I'm ^^terrified ^^to ^^post ^^this ^^because ^^I ^^don't ^^want ^^to ^^have ^^people ^^yelling ^^at ^^me",GirlGamers

There's hope! Men fighting against sexism,"This weekend I volunteered at a local gaming event. A guy came up to me to ask me a question. I mostly answered it when my supervisor came up behind me and also answered the question. The guy who asked the question said to me ‚Äúthank you for the information, you answered my question.‚Äù Then he turned to my supervisor and said ‚Äúyou didn't need to talk over her, she answered my question.‚Äù

My supervisor did not handle it well, and called the guy rude. They got into a really awkward fight where my supervisor was trying to explain himself, while the guy was uncomfortably trying to explain that women get talked over often and it's something men need to be more aware of. 

I was way too uncomfortable at the time to say anything to either of them, but I really really really appreciate the guy. While I didn't feel like I had been talked over, it was so nice to know this guy is aware of some of the struggles AND he was willing to stand up to another guy about it.

Hiding that I am a serious gamer girl,"Not sure if anyone else ever feels this way, but a lot of times no one knows that I play video games or that I enjoy super dorky things. I only got into video games and geeky things after high school so maybe that is why? When I was younger I did watch things like Doctor Who and Sherlock. But now that I am older I not only am a super geek over many things but I love video games. And for some reason, it is something that almost no one knows about me. I think this is because I seem not so dorky on the outside. Like I occasionally wear a Harry Potter sweatshirt or a few video game pins on my jacket but other than that I don't have like a ton of graphic tees or things like that. But when someone finds out that I watch a shit ton of youtube or that I play video games and chat with my friends on discord almost every night, they think it's weird. My best girlfriends didn't even know how much of a dork I was, especially over video games, until recently. And even then they only see like the surface level of how much I game. It's not like I am ashamed or whatever because it really is one of my biggest passions. But for some reason I have a hard time expressing that part of myself. Anyone feel the same way or totally different? Interested to hear why or why not.

I feel like I was just in the unicorn of groups...and it was amazing.,"I've been running Warfronts in WoW today, so basically a raid group of 20 people working together. I'm usually hesitant to speak up in groups because that just seems to open the floodgate for assholes to start chattering, even in text chat. Calling out where help is needed or where I'm headed in battlegrounds often gets ignored at the best, gets me flamed, or somehow leads to people raging and abusing their teammates when stuff goes wrong. (I guess because it reminded them that chat was there? I don't know.)

Not this group, though. Right off the bat, a warlock and a mage were super helpful - explaining tactics and mechanics. Calling out where help would be most helpful. Kind and pleasant and making jokes, to the point where other people were also speaking up and communicating well.

And then another mage made a comment about being ""raped"" at their location. Multiple members of the raid group (including several who had identified themselves as guys through jokes shortly before) immediately called them out, telling them that the comment was offensive and not cool. When the mage decided to tell people to get over it rudely, people encouraged others to report the mage and then vote to kick them from the group. The vote to kick passed before I could even find the mage's name in my raid frames.

I have never felt so safe to communicate with my team before. It actually FELT like a team. It was the best experience I've had in WoW in a long time. Warfronts aren't hard, but that was just a lot of fun because of the people. They really made my night.

Good Guys in Overwatch QP,"I felt the need to share this positive interaction!

I recently got into Overwatch when it went on sale and have been playing all of 2 weeks. For the past week and a half, my best friend (male) has been inviting me to group with him and his regular crew, all guys, and estimated between 16 and 30. I typically game with a family friendly community, so playing with people in voice chat outside of there makes me anxious, as I don‚Äôt know what to expect and typically assume everyone who is a stranger will be toxic.

These 7 dudes have been the nicest, most supportive strangers. When I asked them to watch their language during my stream, they obliged. When I ask questions about which heroes are helpful or where my hero would do best, they show me the ropes. They laugh at my jokes and defend me in the text chat, and always encourage that we stay in our own voice channel when they notice someone being toxic. 

I just wanted to post and share my appreciation for these kind and patient strangers, and hopefully add some optimism to all of my GG fam. There‚Äôs a LOT of toxicity to steel yourself against, but they aren‚Äôt all bad ;)",GirlGamers

Pretty rare? Women make up \~50% of gamers nowadays, as it should be. I hard passed on this guy. Maybe I'm overreacting but it annoys me to see comments like this. I don't feel special because I'm a woman who likes video games and I don't want to either. And if it is rare, then maybe it's because some sectors of the video game world are geared toward young heterosexual men or the communities are just unwelcoming of women in general.

Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption II; What Are Your Thoughts about Dismemberment in Video Games?,"Before there was much info about both games I was pretty hyped at least for RDR II, and also a bit for Cyberpunk 2077 as well. Then it was revealed that there won't be multiple protagonists in RDR II. I'm still salty about not being able apparently to play as Sadie Adler and young John Marston and to be limited to just this other new character Arthur Morgan, but I did cope with this after seeing how beautiful this game looks in the trailers. Also I'm a huge fan of the whole Neo-Western subgenre or simply the current age of the Western genre, however you wish to classify it. So I'm inclined to get over myself to be able to experience this game eventually or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's jump to the gameplay trailer for Cyberpunk 2077. I was pretty tired when I watched it, but the gunplay near the end got me pretty excited. Until V shot away those one guy's legs with a pumpgun/shotgun that is. In the subreddit it seemed that many people even thought of it as funny. I was just horrified. I really don't like seeing dismemberment in any media, but the rough violence with which it was carried out just repulses me. Also I'm no fan of not having the option of a third person perspective in the game. And after CDPR's twitter account tweeted out a transphobic joke this game pretty much died for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to RDR II. Recently it was announced that in that game not only will you be able to play it in first person perspective, you'll also be able to dismember people with shotguns and I was just like nope. It's so unnecessary brutal and it makes killing people in games feel way too real. When they're just ragdolls that collapse and lie down, it doesn't make me feel so guilty. But seeing them hacked or shot into pieces and possibly react to it before dying, It makes me feel ill. I know, I probably don't have to do this when I play, but the thought that it could happen when NPCs fight each other or I in the heat of the moment use the wrong weapon and see this happen horrifies me. So I'm not so sure anymore if I'll actually ever play this game.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to say that you can't enjoy brutal games if that's your taste, but now I feel left out of the fun because I don't. I just want to hear from you whether I'm alone with this or if there are others that are not too thrilled for this kind of features. Are there other things comparable to this that are major turn offs for you?

&amp;#x200B;

Strangely, It's only the case with dismemberment for me. I can play the new God of War without feeling bad even though it's pretty brutal as well. Maybe I'm just weird.",GirlGamers
Do you tell people that you are a gamer?,"I've been regularly gaming for nearly 3 years now and I have always been shy about it. It took me some time to get the courage to tell my closest friends that this is what I ""waste"" my time on.

Now my question is; do you tell people (especially guys) that you are as they say a girl gamer? Do you think it's awkward? Because I find it really hard to say. I feel like I get judged and that they just don't believe me. Which is really frustrating.",GirlGamers
Obsessed with Battlefront 2. HELP.,"So ladies, 

I bought Battlefront 2 over the weekend because it was $10 on the Playstation Store and I had my doubts due to how shitty the launch was thanks to the putrescence that is microtransations, but I got it anyway to try out the multiplayer. Y'all, I played it from about 9 am to 1:30 am THE NEXT DAY. I think it's on track to being one of my very favorites. I've never been a multiplayer person. I suck at it. And the guys playing in matches? So rude, so disrespectful, so TRASH. Someone even mentioned how much better Fortnite players were during multiplayer for another game and it's like, then go play Fortnite?

[rant] A little story about a guy I met yesterday,"Last night I went out with some friends and met this guy who asked me about my bachelor's thesis. I study psychology and just started my masters. 

Anyway, I wrote my thesis about the relationship between the video game character and the player and how identification with the character can change the gaming experience. Now I don't have many friends who game so


 I get super excited whenever I get to talk about gaming. So of course once I told him what I wrote about he was all like ""Oh but you don't really game yourself, right?"" and I told him that I did. He asked me to name some video games and I've rattled down all the games I've played since I was I child and I started getting really into it (because I get super excited about it). I tell him how I got the Idea for my thesis after a discussion with my brother on how much we enjoyed the Witcher 3 since I found it really hard to emphasize with Geralt since he is so super alpha (and the women are kinda... I don't know).


Well, then the topic turns back to my thesis because I mentioned how much I enjoyed Horizon Zero Dawn since Aloy is amazing and she looks a little like me (aka redhead). He laughs and is all like ""But she's way too buff, it's so offputting"".That is just ridiculous and I told him that. I like that she looks more muscular and yet still feminine. I mean, she's a warrior, of course she's not a size zero, duh. But I guess he didn't like that. I proceed to tell him that I prefer Aloy's aesthetics to let's say Lara Crofts because it looks more real to me. Again he laughs and says something along the line that Lara is much hotter and I tell him that I don't like sexualized females in video games...


In the end, he told me the worst thing ever. Since I study psychology I must know the working of the mind and how to manipulate people (newsflash: I don't). So the only reason I talk about video games like that when I'm out is that I want to manipulate men (aka him) into sleeping with me. Like... f you! I talk about it because I like it, it's my hobby and I enjoy it.


I only realized then that he was being a sexist asshole about video game characters and also about my course of study. 


Sorry, I just had to vent and I don't have any female gamer friends... hope that's okay


(I apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language..)

EDIT:
I really didn't expect this post to gain so much traction, I just needed to vent :D Anyway, thanks for all the encouraging comments? It was so nice to read all of it, but I haven't really gotten around to replying... sorry guys! Also, my thesis is already done but It's got my real name and location so I'm not too comfortable to share it online (I also don't know if I have the right to post it somewhere or if it 'technically' belongs to my uni and since they haven't posted it online...).

Buuut it was 'only' a theoretical paper... I wasn't allowed to do any actual research like online or lab testing with other studies since only master students are allowed to do that. What I did was to look at the already existing studies that link a few different kinds of identification in video games (character identification, wishful thinking, and avatar identification) to enjoyment in video games as well as other components as playing style (such as competitive vs. non-competitive, gender/age).


**If anyone is interested, I think these were some of the main papers that I based everything on if I remember correctly (and I'm not on my college laptop so I can't look at my lit research folder):**


Hefner, D., Klimmt, C., &amp; Vorderer, P. (2007). Identification with the player character as determinant of video game enjoyment. In Entertainment computing‚ÄìICEC 2007 (pp. 39-48). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.

Rant.,"This will probably contain rape triggers or assault triggers. Please dont read if those things will harm your well being.

So one of my roommates is a guy and plays video games in the livingroom a lot. I dont care much because I play in my room when I am not studying. Well I came out of my room to get some water. I look to see what he is playing, sometimes I come out and watch him play if its a game I enjoy.

He was playing GTA V with some friends. I proceeded to watch him kill a woman, drag her body over to a water fountain and do emotes like he was raping her. He kept laughing and took screenshots when he lined everything right and brought his bodies over to watch well still laughing about it.

Now I am a rape survivor and have some own issues dealing with this kind of stuff. I just went back to my room without even getting the water. I just.. what has made it okay in our society for this to be acceptable.

Needing some input....,"TLDR-Would there be enough intrest in a curvy girl gamer community?

So the long story post...
I am a plus size girl and I'm trying to find my nitch in the streamer/gamer community. I got into streaming about 4 months ago and ended up taking about a month off because life got crazy. I am back now and can't seem to get the footing I had when I first started streaming.

The whole reason I started streaming was to build my brand and take the steps towards becoming a social media/content creator in the gaming industry.(I'm in school of media communications) I know to do this I need to find my nitch and tell my story. The one think I am proud of is that I'm a big girl and I don't care what anyone thinks of that. 

My question to this community is if you think there would be enough girls/women who would want something like this? I have looked all over and there are no twitch streaming communities that are centered around plus size/curvy women. This is one of the only girl gamer reddit. Everything plus size or bbw or any other form of the word in search only turn up fashion related things.

"[Rant] It's 2018, can I stop being accused of being carried?","It has been months since I've ranted regarding this subject but for some reason, this really has bothered me and I keep thinking about it. I've played video games since forever and have faced all the typical abusive, stalker, creepy, interactions you can think of for being a female so you'd think I'd be numb to it by now but this one really has bugged me so much I cannot sleep.


I (F23) play overwatch with my boyfriend (M31). He's higher SR but we can still play together. I play flex depending on what's needed. We've been playing this game since it's come out and has faced all forms of harassment on that game. As we all know Blizzard is trying to fix this 'toxic players' problem they are having with the commending and reporting system which I appreciate


Today during the first game we played, right away a solo player started being very loud and obnoxious. My bf left the voice chat because he didn't want to deal with strangers on the internet. I don't blame him. My bf was taking a break from studying for a test so I'm sure he did not want his bit of free time ruined. I stayed in chat because I was playing the healer (everyone else auto locked dps except 1 tank) and thought it's not a bad idea to try to communicate with the team.


In great OW fashion that solo player started bashing the team in the ""I'm not being toxic I'm giving constructive criticism tone"" I brushed it off and just went on playing and communicating as if things were normal. Nobody talked except him and myself. He kept making comments like ""Let me guess that's your F****** bf."" ""Tell him to switch F*** he's F****** really bad."" ""Why isn't he in chat."" ""Is he mad? I bet he's mad. He's F****** toxic and throwing."" I told the guy no, that my bf was going to play what he deems is right for this team comp (he flexs as well).


""Well he f****** sucks tell him to switch"" I didn't play into his aggression and at this point should've left myself but then he threatened to report the both of us for throwing, and said ""I bet he's mad at you. Why else would he throw? I bet he's tired of carrying his girlfriend."" 


That last line made me see red. Calmly I told him ""You know, you're here telling people they play awful when it's a TEAM game. We all have to work together. You claim WE are toxic and accusing my BF of being mad at me. That's just really sad. I'm not telling him how to spend his free time. Please feel free to report me or him for 'throwing' but there's a reason why we don't have fresh accounts. I am reporting you for abusive communication and I hope the rest of the team who are silently here see that as well."" I reported him and with much satisfaction a few hours later I got a ""Thank you for reporting this player. Actions have been taken"" message from Blizzard. 


This is not the first time people say I'm being carried by some male I qued up with, of course, they are always 100% wrong and in some eye-rolling circumstances, I was clearly the higher rank doing the 'carrying'. What made me sick to my stomach was the fact that he thought my bf was MAD at me because he 'wasn't listening'. WTF kind of delusional world does this guy live in. Also, why is he okay harassing people like this over a video game is beyond me.


TLDR: Toxic player accusing me of being toxic gets banned.",GirlGamers

Fast forward today and it seems like any sort of progress we make at diversification has been met with absolute vitriol. The word diversification is probably causing some circle jerk Redditor to foam at the mouth as we speak. I get it. Ciri is white. She is polish. So people want her depicted that way, right? But why is it that authenticity is only preserved for these specific areas? I don't know about anyone else, but when a white actor is taking the role of someone that was POC in the book/movie, normally the conversation is just, ""oh well, the best person got the part!"" As if ScarJo really was the best person for Ghost in the Shell?! Why is it that these groups and fandoms and gamer circles smugly talk about how POC and or women just aren't that interested in xyz but then make the environment completely unwelcome for any of us to be involved?! My bf and I were looking for nerdy inter-racial couples and could come up with like two? I know that if I cast myself as some black Elena that the fandom will LITERALLY EXPLODE. How do I know this for sure? Because I've seen it happen time and time again. But there are only so many times that I want to dress up as Gamora. When I play online and want to use comm, I specifically feel like I should have my boyfriend there. As a white male, it seems like he shields from the excessive racist sexism I receive when in comm alone. I just don't get it. I guess at the end of the day, I just wish people would just admit they don't want to diversity their fandoms because they don't like minorities and I wish they would just say how they want women to be half dressed in games because they don't respect women. It's frustrating to have to hear someone complete mental gymnastics to explain how not wanting diversity in their fandom isn't racist. It is. Quit with the respectability politics and just call it what it is. This reddit is literally the only thing that keeps me feeling sane. There is always a sense of calm conversation that isn't just littered with screams of ""SJW"" and ""FEMINAZI"". Thank you for existing.",GirlGamers

"Just got a Switch - Need Game Recs, please :)","In anticipation of Diablo 3 being ported to the Switch I went out and bought a Switch over the weekend.  I've been eyeing a portable gaming device for a bit and this seemed like a good time to take the plunge.

I bought Breath of the Wild new and Bayonetta 2 used.  Since Bayonetta 2 was used, I'm testing it out this week to see if I like it and if not, I can return it.  I'm on the fence - I feel like I should be offended by this game, but I'm also kind of liking it.

As for recommendations:  I have an Xbox1 and my favourite games (aside from Diablo 3 which I can't seem to stop playing lol) are anything Bioware puts out (Dragon Age, Mass Effect, KOTOR).  Those are the only games I've played to finish.  I prefer DA to ME only because I'm not a huge fan of shooters (skill reasons, nothing else).  I did also buy Assassins Creed Origins this weekend and played enough to know I will like it.

On the iPad my favourite games are DragonVale, Cradle of Empires, and Sims Freeplay.

With Switch Games being so expensive, I am reluctant to go out and just buy games and see if I like them. 

Thanks!!


ETA:  You people are awesome!  I've got a lot to look up and research.  I think Stardew Valley will be my next purchase though.  It's seems rather calming and hopefully something I can play for 30mins or so here and there instead of a massive time sink.",GirlGamers

"how/where have you found success in avoiding racism, sexism, toxicity in social VR?","I tried searching for Virtual Reality specific post along these lines, but all attempts have failed. I hope I'm not missing something!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: how/where have YOU found success in avoiding racism, sexism, toxicity in VR? What are your experiences, and what solutions might you have found to any adversary you might have experienced in VR?

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of fallen off the VR wagon, and I want to get back into things, but I'm having (what i imagine is a common issue) finding social VR games that aren't the worst with randoms. For a short while in 2016 RecRoom was really pleasant to jump in and chat with strangers. It seemed like VR was a promising alternative to the often disastrous state of the larger ""gaming community"", but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore, maybe because of its increase in popularity.

&amp;#x200B;

Alternately, a friend of mine convinced me to play VRChat on my Vive for the first time, which went passably for 3 hours, until the pleasant stranger I was hanging out with asked me if I was a \*insert racial expletive\*, which seemed to trigger some sort of cascading effect of awful in the immediate area, drawing transphobic, sexist, and racist sentiments out from the people around me. It was like the cork was out of the bottle. I logged out and never played again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've found myself at an impasse here. I really like social VR games. There is something magical about playing ping pong with some person who's on the other side of the planet, or chatting with strangers without us all making assumptions about each-other because of appearances, but now I'm a little afraid to put on my Vive.

&amp;#x200B;

How do YOU do it? What are your experiences, and what solutions might you have found to any adversary you might have experienced in VR?

[Venting] I don't know what to do anymore.,"Hello all, I just started to use reddit as I found it's pretty useful way for the gaming community but aside from that I just really, *really* don't know what to do anymore; I've lost my will to game. My name is Chelly and I'm 26, playing video games since I was a kid. Recently last year a lot of emotional trauma has happened, causing me to pull away from working and maintaining my social life and I started to get back into my video game addiction like I'm a teenager again. Long venting story short, I've made a few friends since last year online, a girl and two guys. However a couple months ago when I rekindled with an old gaming friend who I desperately needed for support (we had a fight; she dropped everything and came back to my side regardless of everything) things started to change. 

Both of the guys I met liked the one girl in my group, and from a big fight that happened the girl was jealous of my relationship with my older friend (we're like two peas in a pod). Apparently this other girl felt like we were best friends, and my older gaming friend was taking me away. This ended up causing chaos after chaos, *after chaos of drama* and since the two guys liked this girl they took her side and basically there was this huge divide in my friendship. I decided since the last two weeks, the three of them have been ignoring myself and my boyfriend and not playing video games with us and playing the same game together, setting their statuses on discord as ""do not disturb"" that I just would let them go and kick them. For the past year since all of my emotional breakdowns, they've been in my life everyday playing video games, talking and whatnot. I deleted them from all my platform friends lists, and since then my old gaming friend now has something going on and does not want to talk after all this has happened, that ""new friends would do me and my bf some good.""

I know this might be confusing to everyone, I have literally no one in my life to vent to. No friends anymore to talk to, I know with my major depression I've pushed a lot of people away I just don't know how to approach anything anymore. Seeing ""GirlGamers"" I felt like some of the girls here (even the guys that are here too) would understand me in some way. My drive to play anything has died; playing Overwatch today I couldn't even get into a match, turning on Monster Hunter World and I couldn't even do an investigation. I just am so angry, frustrated, and upset about everything and with no one to talk to, I sound like a whiny little 11 year old.

Stop saying women are catty within our own community.,"While perusing on another post I was shocked to see how many girls were saying the majority of females that are into gaming or are 'nerds' are catty and bitchy. They're not dude. Look at all the women in this subreddit, your generalization would apply to the majority of us, and it's just not true.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you do experience this take into consideration that maybe these women had a rough day, maybe you misunderstood something, or as harsh as it sounds, maybe you're just not good at socializing. As an introvert, I know I struggle with socializing a lot. Sometimes we harp so much about how the men are rude to us and how they undermine us or whatever, but look at how we treat ourselves sometimes. Treat people the way you want to be treated.

&amp;#x200B;

I am fully aware that there are exceptions, that maybe a small portion of women really are toxic or really do like being the 'queen bee'. I'm just so tired of always seeing women complain about other women in the gaming/nerd scene. Make friends with one another and celebrate your interests together, don't put each other down.

I got an email from riot saying 'we should have banned you because any name that's considered offensive by the community is therefore offensive' but that isn't in the community guidelines.

The Juxtaposition of Girls in Games vs. Movies/TV.,"Is it just me or is there some kind of severe disconnect among men (young and older) that can cheer on movies like Wonder Woman or shows like Jessica Jones where there's so much praise by these men in r/movies etc. and then turn around and be so horrible to women playing games?

This was pointed out in recent posts about [Riot Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/9e0907/league_of_legends_players_being_against_womenonly/), examples from [Rainbow Six](https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/9eomr9/for_rainbow_six_siege_players_here/), and the [Battlefield Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/comments/9ehlmv/played_the_bf_v_beta_the_bf_community_is_ugh/).  Among may other examples.  

I play to relax after work or a stressful day.  I hope that when a guy sits down to play they're in the same mindset and not starting up a game thinking ""I can't wait to harass the first female I see"".

So if we're both trying to unwind and enjoy a game, where does the switch come the second someone sees or hears a girl in a game?  Is there an actual psychological conditioning behind this?  Especially when, as I brought up above, so many of the same people can praise Gal Gadot or Daisy Ridley or Krysten Ritter for the roles they've played in very popular franchises?

We shouldn't be afraid to use a mic or play a game!  To be told to show ""bobs or vagene"" or to get in the kitchen or any number of other harassing behaviors.  Or, perhaps worse, be invalidated for simply existing and liking something when it has absolutely zero bearing on a internet stranger's existence.  

Nearly 40% of money spent on video games was by women in 2016 according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinanderton/2017/04/25/the-business-of-video-games-how-much-is-being-spent-and-why-infographic/#658857736fe8) and it blows my mind a little that so much harassment is allowed by major companies when so much money is spent on their products by women.

Old Female Characters,"Just wondering if anyone can think of any awesome, older female characters in games. Bonus points if they're good guys, extra bonus points if they're the protagonist.  It seems that most old women in gaming are antagonists.  

When playing Dark Souls I deliberately made my character a badass old woman. Her name became Granny Gitgud. I loved the option of actually being able to make an ""unattractive"" character. Usually age sliders are like... ""young man"" vs ""old grizzled war veteran"" for dudes, and ""young woman"" vs ""young woman with the faintest of possible wrinkles if you squint just right"".

Should I quit playing League of Legends?,"The first time I heard [~~@~~**Froskurinn**](https://twitter.com/Froskurinn) shoutcast gave me such a thrill in my heart - a woman's voice in eSports - killin' it!  LoL has been my game for the last 5 years and now I can't see anything LoL related without a sinking feeling in my gut because of all the misogyny.  

 League has been MY GAME the last 5 years - my flat is filled with merchandise and every device has splash art wallpapers.  I felt at home on summoner's rift except when I was regularly harassed because my name was obviously female.

 A friend at Riot helped me get a name change and once I changed to a gender-neutral name a lot of the harassment and lewd comments stopped, even if sometimes my mannerisms gave me away (quickly followed by ""are you a girl? do you have a boyfriend?!"" 

 It's more obvious than ever just how little most people understand about what's going on in the gender gap and how minorities and marginalised groups experience living in the world. I'm extremely disappointed in Riot's responses both to the Kotaku article and backlash from PAX 

 I know losing just one player isn't going to mean a lot to them but it means a lot to me. I'm losing a space that I've loved and lived in - I'm losing all the time and money I've invested into the game, and lost respect for an industry I thought could be something for me. 

 I know there are good employees at Riot.  I am praying with everything I have that Riot does what it does best, and finds a way to tell a better story about the games community that is inclusive and not color/gender blind, but celebratory.

It's semi-related, but also long and a bit off-topic. So now it's here. I feel like I'm at least partially right in my conclusion, but am open to feedback. Mostly because it's left me frustrated and a bit hopeless. In short, I want to be wrong but don't think I am.]

CD Projekt Red got into a rather minor bit of ""trouble"" recently on Twitter for using a memey joke that you typically find in anti-trans trolling (""Are you assuming their gender!?""). After they apologized (a bit backhandedly), the responses were mostly, ""Okay"" or ""That's not a great apology."" Pretty mild stuff, imo. Apparently, a few people were still really angry about the joke. However, for every one person saying ""okay"" or still mad, there were dozens who were shitposting stuff along the lines of ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" or ""stop appeasing SJWs."" 

Meanwhile, over on YouTube, a number of gamer personalities like LegacyKilla posted videos about ""the huge outrage"" over the joke. Pretty much every one of those videos painted a picture of loads of people being *outraged* rather than some being mildly offended or annoyed (and a few being actually outraged), painted it as a *massive* deal when most gaming sites didn't even bother covering it, and essentially toed this line of not being anti-trans while, at the same time, totally dismissing the reason anyone was offended in the first place. The commenters, unsurprisingly, were in the same boat as the ones on Twitter. A mix of anti-LGBT/anti-""SJW""/""people need to stop getting offended,"" etc.

Thing is, those videos try to appear *relatively* unbiased. As if they're presenting a situation in which they could be convinced of someone's error but ultimately aren't. (They typically give themselves away pretty fast, if you know anything of the alt-right. Nevermind that they're critiquing Twitter/forum responses but never bother to examine the **actual** majority of responses that include outright homophobia and trolling.) Gamer personalities like that, videos like that, paint a picture of hordes of ""SJWs"" crying about nothing for no reason. That those SJWs are attacking vulnerable, defenseless people/companies and that they are the only ones saying anything (as opposed to what it usually is - a handful of people pointing out bullshit in the middle of a much bigger group supporting said bullshit - aka, what happened on r/witcher that caused someone to bring the issue over here after being downvoted to hell). It's a picture the GG folks like, but it's also one that helps introduce new individuals into an anti-critique and anti-diversity mindset. Once you've allowed yourself to be convinced that an ""SJW"" has no reasonable critique or logical explanation for anything, then you can dismiss anyone that gets labeled an ""SJW"" before they've ever even said anything.

The ""REEEE-ing"" won't end because a significant portion of gamers are more or less indoctrinated into the mindset of ""Anyone that critiques games/developers/etc about anything to do with race or gender is an SJW and all SJWs are just screeching, attention-seeking losers."" And they have entire sections of the internet reinforcing those views 24/7. Sections that don't typically self-critique and will twist themselves into knots to deny faults in their own side's logic (like how click-baity and thin LegacyKilla's video was, how it brought up James Gunn's firing without explicitly saying the alt-right was behind it, etc).

In short, just like in national politics, discussions about gaming is screwed because we no longer have objective reality anymore, just echo chambers and streamers/YouTubers that tell us how to think. And so long as the algorithms keep giving us what it thinks we want, we'll never have to worry about changing our minds. It's left me questioning whether I actually want to engage with other gamers in the future if most of them are like this. And it does **feel** like most of them are, even if a majority are very young and *might* grow out of it.

[And to clarify, what initially bothered me about this whole thing wasn't the legions of gross comments, it was that no one seemed to stop and wonder why these videos even existed in the first place. I saw it as, before I read a single comment, clickbait nonsense with really poor/no evidence of mass outrage.]",GirlGamers

"I played Fortnite with my favorite streamer, Loserfruit, last night","and I still can't believe it. I've been a huge fan and supporter of hers since around March or so and heard about her during her Overwatch phase, but it wasn't until Fortnite that I grew to love and adore her. And last night, I was lucky enough to be able to win one of her Twitch subscriber games that was determined at random. I was freaking out when I saw that I won, and my brother and friends were freaking out and watching me and cheering me on and supporting me because I was SOO nervous and they know how much I love her. I'm talking, voice slightly shaking, hands shaking. I totally have a crush on her she's such a cute, soft, quiet, Australian streamer who is honestly the sweetest, down to earth thing in the world. 

But nerves aside, I talked to her in the time that we played together and joked around with her. She even said a couple of times (and her thousands of viewers as well) that I have a ""lovely voice"" (link: https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousShinyMuleDatBoi) and I was fangirling so hard. She's still on my Fortnite friends list, and I got some followers on my channel, and Loserfruit's friends all said I'm ""incredibly sweet and cute"" and invited me to talk to them more. 

What an amazing night last night. Still feels so surreal. It's something so small, but I don't fangirl that often, or at least not since I was a teenager. I missed it, honestly. Makes me feel like a kid again (even though I'm only 20 LOL)

Tired of being expected to talk,"This is probably going to come across as a really petty rant, I don't know, but I kind of dislike how popular Discord has become. Like, practically everyone has their own server. I think the software itself is great, but now there seems to be, (at least to me) this expectation that if I'm playing a video game with you, I'll join your Discord. 

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously I'm pretty much an introvert, but I really just don't feel comfortable sometimes using a voice chat. I'm perfectly fine using text chat, but I'm really insecure about my voice. However! I love to make friends and play with random people online, I've made some online gamer friends that have turned into real, close friends. Anyways, I used to play League a ton in the past, now only occasionally, and I would always add people who seemed friendly or who I had good synergy with. Years ago though, before Discord was popular (or maybe even existed idk) I'd add guys and we'd just play, talk in-game, maybe make some jokes. The occasional creep, but the point is that most of the time, we were just gaming buddies. If I saw them on, I might invite them to a game, I might not, and vice versa. I rarely had people asking me to join their Teamspeak or Raidcall, or whatever, and if they did, it was usually after some time, after we've gotten to know each other a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays though, It seems like most guys I end up adding (mostly on league but I've had some problems on overwatch too) will immediately send me an invite to their Discord. I'm not really offended by it, but that's not how I roll. If I do join, I'd just be really quiet and probably awkward while the rest of the guy's dudebros carry on, make offhanded comments about my gameplay, conveniently forget that I'm in the channel with them, etc. Not to mention how a lot of Discord servers have really weird stuff going on in them. I joined one where they would just put their awkward fetish porn in whatever channel they pleased, and if they though it was really good, they'd tag it with @everyone.

 So now, I just politely decline. Nope, sorry dude, just don't feel like joining your discord. This has happened a bunch of times, and only a few times were they just okay with it. Other times, they would pester me about it or invite me to it repeatedly, sometimes they would just treat me differently, and of course, I've also been harassed about it. It just seems to me that now there is this expectation to go and join your Discord, because its so easy and accessible.. why not? I just miss the days where not everyone had a voice server and where guys wouldn't invite me to theirs so casually. I don't know, is it just me, or do some of ya'll feel the same way? This is mostly based from a handful of experiences of of League, but maybe someone has had similar experiences.

Is Ciri from the Witcher white in the books? (analysis),"Hi! Ciri, one of the main protagonists from the witcher series has been recently annouonced to be casted as a BAME (black/asian/minority/ethnic) person in the Netflix series.

 As everyone in /r/witcher seems to be all up in arms about Ciri being 100% canonically white I thought I would present another point of view on this case that might not be necessarily in line with that.

I am a fan of both books and the games and I also happen to be polish so i can understand the source material and the context (as can any polish person). I've tried posting to /r/witcher but I just get downvoted to hell so I thought I would try posting here.

First of all Ciri is white in the games - this isn't really up for debate. That's why probably most people identify with Ciri being white, it's understandable. Is Ciri white in the books though? Let's see.

**How Did Ciri Look like in the books?**

The books are pretty vague about her skin colour. What most (English speaking) people seem to quote is this fragment from Sword of Destiny

&gt; ‚ÄúShe had fair hair, ashen white complexion and large impetuous green eyes‚Äù

 Sword of Destiny page 416. 

Most people think ""white complexion"" is about her skin colour which is actually false but I can see how it could be interpreted like that from the context. However what the quote is talking about is just her hair ""fair hair - ashen white complexion"". Here is the same quote from the original books in polish:

&gt; Mia≈Ça jasne, mysiopopielate w≈Çosy i wielkie, jadowicie zielone oczy. 

Quote taken from: http://wiedzmin.wikia.com/wiki/Ciri/Opisy_z_ksi%C4%85%C5%BCek_i_gier

From this quote it is very clear that Sapkowski (the Author of the book series) is talking just about her hair (literally fair and mouse-like) and her green eyes. 
 
As I said the books are pretty vague about her ethnic appearance. The best we can get is that she was descibed as pale, green eyed and having ashen hair - none of those attributes can tell us anything about her ethnic background. Being pale doesn't necessarily equal white as it only describes the lightness of the complexion (same as tan doesn't mean ""black""). Especially in polish the word for pale (which is ""blady"") means more that person looks anemic/ill or light-shaded. As for the ashen-grey hair, it doesn't exist naturally in the real world among children. That's why it's literally a fantasy and doesn't very well translate to the real world, eh?

**Ciri's parents &amp; isn't Ciri ""polish"" or ""Slavic""?**

The books state that Ciri has elven blood on her mother's side and on her father's side she is Nilfgardian. Nilfgaard is described as Southern Kingdoms in the books (as opposed to the Northern Kingdoms who are being invaded by Nilfgaardian Empire.) If you wanted to make an allegory to Europe Nilfgaard would be Spain, France and the like and Nothern Empires would be England, Germany, Poland etc. Spanish or Mediterranean people in general have more darker complexion than people from Northern Europe. Either way this comparison isn't really relevant as again we're talking about a fantasy realm but it might be a bit useful to disprove the claim that Ciri is ""polish"" or ""northern"". I mean her full name is literally Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, that doesn't sound very slavic or polish, does it?

**Sapkowski**

Now what is undoubtedly polish is the Author. But that doesn't necessarily make every character in the book polish like, does it? There is a little piece of information about Sapkowski's opinion on casting BAME people as characters in the Witcher series -

&gt; She went on to say that the author of the Witcher books, Andrzej Sapkowski, told her himself that recognizing the diversity in her show would be honoring his intentions as a writer.

 https://kotaku.com/netflix-witcher-writer-tries-to-smooth-unfounded-racial-1825960625

""honoring his intentions as a writer"" - this isn't really surprising if you know the general context and message hidden in the books. Books (and games to an extent) show a world where discrimination against different races - Humans, dwarfs and Elves - is common. Sapkowski wanted to show how prejudice and discrimination can be destructive. Same goes for making a lot of strong female characters in the series - there is a lot of progressive messages hidden in the Witcher series. Ciri is also gay in the books, she even has a special tattoo reminding her of her girlfriend Misiles.

**""World of the Witcher is POLISH, therefore every person is white""**

Again the world isn't polish. It's loosely based on medieval Europe and includes a lot of myths from all over Europe, not only Poland. For example The Wild Hunt is actually a very Germanic myth. It also includes dragons, mutants, trolls, water hags, witchers and all kinds of different beings. I mean it's literally impossible in that world for Ciri to be non white...

Here is an interesting quote from an interview with Sapkowski about the boundaries in fantasy where he says:

&gt; Fantasy takes place neither in the past nor in the future. What do you mean you can't use a certain item or requisite because the people ""didn't know it"" in that times? Too many people see fantasy in that way now. it's a misunderstanding of the genre.

Dysgraphia and Gaming [vent],"I talked about this on the discord already but I wanted to make an actual post about it. I have dysgraphia and hate how people treat others who have issues pushing buttons and admit it. I really struggle with both push to talk and push to mute, although push to mute is a bit easier. However, when I say I'm having issues, people range from dicks to just coming across as unfeeling. Part of it is my mechanical keyboard, but I've had people suggest push to talk when I'm having issues with push to mute (like if I specifically say the issue is pushing the button, idk how push to talk is any better) and probably the worst reaction I had was someone tell me smugly ""I just got used to pushing the button."" That's like telling someone with dyslexia ""I just got used to reading the right letters."" It holds me back a lot, but the thing I hate most about it is how people don't really understand it. Because of it I've been bullied by both peers and teachers, and it makes me feel like a ""fake"" gamer. I'll never be good because of it, but I can get decent. I just needed to vent, but if others have this or a similar issue I'd like to know how you cope. I know with dysgraphia it really depends on the gamer. One of my professors was a gamer with severe dysgraphia and he preferred controller vs keyboard and mouse, which is what I prefer. I can aim so much better with keyboard and mouse, but controller can really streamline the buttons for you. ",GirlGamers

League of Legends players being against women-only League panel at PAX,"So at PAX West, Riot Games hosted sessions focused on supporting women and non-binary people (probably in response to the sexism exposed at the company earlier). To no one‚Äôs surprise, several people of our lovely League community were against that because men weren‚Äôt included FOR ONCE. They threw pretty big fits over this. Two Rioters responded against this backlash pretty aggressively over social media. One of them was Daniel Z Klein, a pretty known Systems Designer at Riot. 


Both of them got fired due to not following the policies. They were told not to engage with the public regarding this. Personally, I think it‚Äôs fair enough if they‚Äôre let go because of not following the company‚Äôs policies. What I‚Äôm frustrated about is the League community, especially the League subreddit right now. They‚Äôre crying about how it wasn‚Äôt fair that there were sessions meant for only women and non-binary people... and not men.

Boyfriend gets upset when I play poorly?,"Hey all, I'm a girl who plays games and I met a guy about a year ago online through mutual friends. It was all fun and we started liking each other. We've been in a long-distance relationship. We always play games together and for the most part, it's fine. However, he gets upset/annoyed at me when I play badly or make a mistake in game. I'm not a competitive player, I play to have fun and talk with him because we can never have a conversation without any distractions on his side. He always has to be playing a game or watching a video on the side so he usually isn't focused on the topic and rambles useless things. That's the main reason why I try games he enjoys because otherwise, we can't hang out at all.

Him, on the other hand, is a competitive player. He likes to be on the top of rankings and win games. He gives me so much pressure when I play with him. When I make a bad play, he gets annoyed and questions me. ""Why did you do that?"" ""What were you thinking?"" ""Why didn't you do this, that, blahblah?"" I've mentioned to him numerous times that I dislike it when he questions my game play because I hate myself for doing it too. I know I'm not as good as he is, and I know I'll never be as good... but when he says those things, I feel unmotivated to keep playing with him. When I confront him, telling him that I don't think he should get annoyed or upset at me over a game, he tells me I shouldn't be getting upset at him because he was only upset for a few minutes. But no matter how long he was upset at me for, he still got upset at me over a game, which is the main reason why I get annoyed at him. He sometimes wouldn't even admit that he was upset/annoyed even though it's obvious he was.

Am I overreacting? It really brings my mood down and makes me feel like I'm not good enough to play with him. I usually look forward to playing games and talking to him, but when he tells me I'm bad, I just feel like I don't ever want to play with him again. He reasons that I just haven't played the games enough to be good at it. If he cared, shouldn't he be trying to motivate me instead of putting me down?

Girl Gamer Communities In Sydney Or Aussie In General?,"Hi there lovely folks on this thread! :D 

Not sure if this is allowed as I'm looking for external links? I'm currently doing a uni project on Australian women in gaming, and I'm having trouble looking for girl gamer communities or personalities in Sydney (or Australia) to reach out to. I would really appreciate it if anyone could refer some active FB groups or communities to me? I also want to join these for my personal reasons as it's been difficult finding peeps to talk or game with since I've been here. D:

(We only have one console, must be split-screen for two or more)","My dad recently approached me asking if I knew any console shooter games that we could play together. The only game I have that we can play split-screen is Minecraft, and he said that he thought that was boring and wanted a shooter game. I only play Overwatch, Fortnite, and Gigantic so I didn't really have anything for split-screen use. I tried searching for some good FPS  games, but I can't find any good split-screen ones and I only have one console, and he's not gonna buy another one for himself, so we're going to have to play together on the console with two controllers.

Can't handle the sexism on the League of Legends subreddit,"The sexism scandal just seems to be the butt of every joke on the main LoL subreddit. I'm tired of all the memes. I scroll through the threads and see stuff like:

""If there were women-only queues, every game would be 5 supports v 5 supports""

""Why is that commentator defending women when she herself is trying to be a man.""

""To make things fair we need to remove all male champions from league.""

""Women can do anything that men can do, when you don't let men do anything.""

I know these are jokes, but they are sexist jokes, the same stuff Riot was getting in trouble for just a few weeks ago. It's so upsetting. I unsubscribed from the subreddit.

Also, I saw so many users saying they were 'quitting league' when Riot declared the NB/female-only room at PAX. Oh, but the years of sexism against women before that didn't make you want to quit? Because ONE rioter called you a manbaby (which I absolutely do NOT condone - that is NOT okay language) you want to quit? As opposed to the years of sexism that women faced?

It seems so... Childish... Like the subreddit is just stomping its feet and whining. I hate all the sexism talk. Can't we just get back to playing the game?",GirlGamers

I wanna talk about To The Moon,"This is a game I picked up at a steam sale ages ago and left it in my library to play later. I knew it was one of those lite on gameplay heavy on story type of games but that's about it. Yesterday I was bored and figured I'd give it a try. I ended up spending my whole evening playing it start to finish, there was just never a point where I got bored of it or didn't want to know what happened next. Even now, a full day later I still can't get it out of my head. I can't possibly recommend this game enough, if you want a good story you'll find it in To The Mom.

This game left me a blubbering mess and I loved every second of it. But even as sad as it was, there's still a bunch of really funny moments. Trying not to spoil anything but the NASA presentation bit had me in stitches. I'm going to stop here because I'm honestly afraid that this is just going to devolve into a spoiler filled fangasum.

* How to be a Producer

What are some fun games to play with your SO?,"Hey ladies! I have a dilemma (sort of).

So, normally I play a lot of indie or farming games. Stardew Valley, Runescape, A Hat in Time are basically my top 3 games for PC. I really like games that are similar to Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing too; basically casual. Something with an end goal in mind is ideal.

However, I have noticed my boyfriend doesn't really share the same genre of games as me. For example, he's a HUGE fan of Monster Hunter (and I'd prefer to play something where combat isn't a main thing, or is just optional in general). I have bought us both GTAV, and will get A Hat in Time for him once it goes co-op.

I do have a few indie games which don't hold my interest for too long and/or aren't multi-player (Slime Rancher, Yonder: Cloud Catcher Chronicles, Staxel, My Time at Portia, Don't Starve Together, Overcooked 1, etc).

We both tend to play Town of Salem together and occasionally RuneScape. (Does anyone know of any MMOs like this besides WoW?) and what games do you guys find playing with your SO?

"Anyone else used to feel like they had to ignore their ""girly side?""","I was one of those tomboys growing up that hated pink and dresses all because that's what girls were supposed to like.  I grew up in a very close minded town and was very influenced by that mindset.  It wasn't until college that I realized feminism wasn't a bad thing and that being ""girly"" isn't a bad thing.  Still, it wasn't until recently where I've started to admit that I like pink and dresses are really cute.


Being into gaming, comics, and fantasy were things only boys liked in my town.  I felt like I couldn't have a ""girly"" side growing up.  But I also hated how my mom always said, ""Everyone is going to think you're a boy.""  Or similar things.  It didn't help that every other girl my age seemed to hate all my interests, but all the boys were too embarrassed to hang out with a girl.


Now I'm out of that backwards town and living with my boyfriend.  My battle station is filled with pink and purple, a Tracer poster to my right, and a shelf full of funko pops and gaming figurines to my left.  It's great finally embracing both worlds.  All I need to do is cable management and get some LED strips for my case and it'll be perfect.

Dark souls 1 is a game about godly adventure fantasy, dungeon crawling exploration and deep combat and level traversal which involves strategy (which many people confuse with pride conquests and masochism because the art and need for thinking seems to be so unusual to people XD)

Bloodborne is more orientated around aggressive/flashy gameplay. Demon's souls was even more closer to ocarina of time puzzles and boss strategies. Amazingly designed levels and lovecraftian feels. Dark souls 2 and 3 are streamlined and not designed in the same way entirely tho sadly...

I'm a gamer and my boyfriend hates it.

In reply I got ""gamer girls are hot, blah blah blah."" I told him no I'm not a ""gamer girl"", I play video games. Still, I'd constantly be called his ""cute little gamer girl"". Now we live together and I play things like Overwatch daily, he doesn't like it at all. I get loud but I don't go psycho like he does, but whenever I say in a frustrated tone ""why are my team mates running into ults"" etc. He gets so annoyed and mad. It's so frustrating when guys expect girls to be the stereotypical gamer girl who gets excited over getting one kill while dying 10+ times in one game. When we're actually good, try to give pointers like ""I'm playing a healer, let me heal you before you try to take on the whole enemy team by yourself with no health"", we're not ""cute gamer girls"" anymore, we're annoying girls who shouldn't play. Guys can get as loud as they like, if we say otherwise we're in the wrong. But if we get into a game, we're annoying. You date a gamer, expect them to act just like you when it comes to video games.

Major CS:GO vent,"Mobile, so sorry for formatting. 

I used to be a pretty avid CS:GO player. It has been nearly half a year since I played, so I jumped onto some retake servers to get myself back in the flow of things. I‚Äôm pretty trash at the moment due to my extended period of no game play. I‚Äôve never been great at it, so I stick to community servers built for learning purposes anyways. 

While in this retake, I encountered the nastiest, most vulgar player I have ever had the displeasure of being on the same team as. Immediately he started calling me retarded, saying that I had downs, and just kept it going. Eventually I was just like ‚ÄúHey, I get it, I haven‚Äôt played in months. No reason to be rude. This is retake; if you want to help out and give tips then great, I‚Äôd be more than happy to listen.‚Äù I get met with being told that I sound like I am the nastiest cunt he had ever heard, that my pussy is probably the most disgusting thing on this planet, and that I should just never use a mic or talk because I‚Äôm a bitch. I sat there dumbfounded for a good few seconds and finally managed to muster up a response of saying that he is the definition of the toxicity in this community that ruins gameplay and discourages new users from wanting to play. There was more on his end that pretty much was a slew of insults relating to me, my voice, and my vagina. I ended up just disconnecting and going into a different server before he was even finished ranting. 

I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences in CS, being that it is in general a toxic community, but this one definitely tops all of them. I‚Äôve never seen a community that is so toxic to female players.",GirlGamers

would it be weird if I ranted for a minute?,"this past weekend has been pretty stressful and annoying for me, for a couple reasons, and I feel like I just need to get my feelings out there. sorry if this isn't the right place for this, mods

Shine 2018 just took place recently. Shine is a yearly tournament series that takes place in my city. my wife and I attended the first Shine two years ago to both help run things, and to play Super Smash Bros. Melee, a game that we both loved very much. as women in gaming, we weren't strangers to the standard gamerdude vitriol, but in many ways this event was the last straw.

through a total fluke, my wife and I both ended up playing on the events Twitch stream, which had tons of viewers. and I made the mistake of looking at the chat. it was a disgusting, sobering reminder that as women we were largely not welcome in the same way men are in the community. even with all of the chat mods, the chat was dominated by people arguing over whether I was ""doable"". my wife had it even worse.

it was so disappointing. this wasn't the first time something like that had happened, but it was largest scale I'd ever personally experienced it. when dudes get on stream, people talk about the gameplay, the matchups and the strategy. every time a woman got on stream the only topic of discussion was whether she was fuckable. our dedication and practice and skills didn't matter. we were just an oddity, a sideshow. between that weekend and the harassment we were experiencing at our own local venue, we stopped playing that game. it didn't feel worth it anymore.

now like I said, this was literally years ago, and maybe I just need to get over it. and I really really try to do that, by putting myself back out there, not letting assholes keep me from the things I love. this past week I attempted to distract myself from the painful memories by playing the new WoW expansion with a friend of mine. she doesn't like doing dungeons though, so I figured I'd just queue in with four random other players. like, they can't tell I'm a girl, surely I won't experience any gendered harassment right? shouldn't be a problem.

I'll admit, I made a silly mistake right towards the beginning. but that's when the party chat devolved into chaos for the rest of the run.

""girl gamer detected?""

I apologize for my mistake.

""yup lmao only girls say sorry and play resto druid""

""fucking furries wasting our time""

""get off your boyfriends account and make him a sandwich""

at that point it didn't matter what I said or did, they already decided I was a shitty fake girl gamer even though they could not see or hear me. the insults continued as I healed them through the instance. after we won, I got a private message. I heard the alert sound and thought maybe for a second someone was gonna apologize, maybe even tell me I did a good job. but no

""delete your account, bitch""

I was trying to forget about the time I was harassed out of community, but ended up with a whole new crappy memory on top of it.

I... don't really know what point I was trying to make with all this. it just hurts so much to be constantly pushed out of my hobbies for no reason. even as the years pass, it feels like things don't get any easier for women in gaming.

so I guess my point is that I really *really* admire all of y'all who continue to do what you love in the face of overwhelming toxicity. you're all so strong and awesome and inspiring and I hope I'm able to find that same courage in myself someday. I love you all.

EDIT: I never do this but thank you all so much for your responses. people like you are the reason I keep going, and I hope I can continue to do the same for others. just wanna thank you all in the OP in case I don't get around to responding to everyone :x",GirlGamers

Well many attempts at many different things later, and it just wasn't going to work. We had to reinitialize the console which means wiping all of the data.

Ladies, I have to start EVERYTHING over from scratch. It fucking hurts. My farms in Stardew Valley, my file in the Witcher which I have been savoring and playing through every little detail ever since the game came out. The list goes on of games I'll have to start fresh with. It's been a few days and I just don't even have the motivation to start. I tried being optimistic, getting to play it all from the beginning how fun! But honestly I just feel so defeated and upset. Maybe I just need to let my disappointment simmer for a bit. I truly hope I'll have the motivation to start playing again. 

Thanks for reading, just needed to vent my frustrations :/ moral of the story is back up your save data onto a flash drive or external hard drive every now and again. I don't pay for Play Station Plus or whatever it is so I couldn't just automatically back up saves to their cloud or what have you. It sucks. ",GirlGamers

Upcoming indie games,"I've compiled a list of upcoming indies (procrastination, yep), and thought that it can be useful for people here too.

I focused on bigger more maistream games, that could be released on Steam (there's much more upcoming games on itch.io and other more niche sites, of course).

The definition of modern indie is debatable, but I was looking at format, not financial independence (I believe indie has already become a format in gaming, as it is in music or comics). But I understand that there're a lot of grey areas.

The genre distribution is tentative, since it's unclear for some games yet, others combine genres.

The links are to Steam and dedicated sites when Steam is unavailable (these are in italic).

It's be really great to learn about other upcoming indies, so, please, post away.

Pls correct mistakes.

So:

Looking for some wholesome LoL players???,"My boyfriend introduced me (23F) to the game and I quite enjoy it (though admittedly I‚Äôm more interested in the lore and how the characters interact with each other - I‚Äôm not really into ‚Äúmeta‚Äù or becoming a diamond or master level player).  While I am looking for ways to improve my play here and there (cool combos, ways to interact with the map, builds, passive abilities), I find that he and most of his friends/siblings are significantly better than me and just get frustrated with me or are way too competitive...  so I just stay silent and try my best to not-fuck-up whenever I play with them. Enough incidents have happened now where I just refuse to play with people altogether because it makes me way too anxious and down on myself.

I‚Äôm looking for some friends who are easygoing and chill and just want to play League because it‚Äôs fun.  I‚Äôm not looking for a coach and I recognize that I‚Äôm ‚Äútrash‚Äù so to speak but I don‚Äôt think that means I deserve to be talked down to or abused whenever I make a mistake or a poor play.  The League community can be pretty toxic so I‚Äôm just looking for some safety while learning, I guess.

I just beat the first Uncharted after 3 years! Now I've started Bioshock and it already seems great.,"I technically started Uncharted something like 3 or 4 years ago. When I first started trying to play it, I hadn't gotten my anxiety treated yet - and something about this game spikes my anxiety bad.

&amp;#x200B;

 It might be that I play a lot of fantasy games where weapons are unrealistic things like spells and such, and aggressive language has always been a bit reigned in. I didn't have much trouble with things like Skyrim, for example. However, I adored Fallout (3, New Vegas, and 4) which has plenty of actual/realistic weapons and aggressive language - but it's very non-linear so if a situation were stressing me out too much I could step back and do something else in game before trying again.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea how bad Uncharted would spike my anxiety but the combination of unrelenting gunfire in a closed space with repeating waves of enemies slowly closing in on me and yelling at me set me off. It's been 3 or 4 years collectively - I've restarted the game maybe 2 or 3 times. And for the most part I've only been able to play it for 20 mins at a time before it starts to raise my stress again - but I wanted to be like Indiana Jones! I wanted to fight some bad guys, explore some ruins and find sweet treasure!

&amp;#x200B;

Beating it feels like beating my anxiety to a certain extent. I've come a long way from how I used to be and I finished this thing that I struggled with but knew I wanted to do. I just started Bioshock today and it already seems great. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have Uncharted 2 and 3, but I'm really torn on if I should even try to play them considering the first one was so difficult for me personally. I have heard that the games get much better - but that could mean a lot of different things. I'd like to hear some insight from anyone willing to share! If the rest of the series focuses on story and puzzles more, that would be a huge plus.",GirlGamers

Im running out of games to play,"Hey so as the title says I'm in need of a new game. I enjoy open world games, games I can do other stuff besides the story, like Skyrim, or Witcher 3 or Dragon Age inquisition, or even Horizon Zero Dawn. I preordered Spyro reignited trilogy last week and thought I only had a month but unfortunately they had to push back the release date which is fine I want the best gaming experience from my childhood game. 

But my plan was to play through a few of my other games and then assassin's Creed Origins, God Of War and then Horizon Zero Dawn in the three weeks leading up to the release but now I don't have anything to play at the end of Horizon, which sucks.

So I guess I'm looking for suggestions on what kind of games I can get on the PS4 or even PS3 that are similar to the ones I listed, with a story but also a nice amount of side quests. ",GirlGamers

DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS ONLINE GAME??,"Hi! I've recently gotten into playing online games I did when I was younger, there's one game I completely cannot remember the name of!

‚Äã

You picked one of three monster/animal things to be your avatar and you could customize the color of it. Then you walked around on a server with other people playing their little monster/animal things. You could chat. There were quests you could complete and points you earned from games. It was similar to neopets in that.

‚Äã

I don't remember the name of the game or if it's even still up. I remember specifically that this game was SUPER cute.

‚Äã

TLDR; There's an old game I'm trying to find where your avatar is a little monster and you run around solving quests. Or is there a better sub for this? Y'all, I'm just trying to relive the simpler times in my gaming. Pls help!!

"Welp, looks like my ""friends"" are into destroying friendships now...","My friends and I got burnt out on Overwatch (again, hey it happens!) and we decided to try out a game called Deceit. With the unbeatable price point of FREE it was hard to resist.

I'm not a horror game player, but they like coaxing me into playing them because it's funny when your friends get scared right? I mean I'm terrified of Dead by Daylight, but it's exhilarating and I suck at it, but it's all in good fun.

So back to Deceit. If you're not familiar with the game, there are 6 people in the game. Two are infected and become terrors at night. Main objective is for the innocents to escape through three zones, or the terrors to kill everyone. Pretty simple right?

:C

Well, there are blood bags around the map, for the terrors to drink. You can usually hear if they're drinking, so if you're camping a blood bag to see if anyone drinks, then cool, you can say you saw them drink it... but they can also turn that around on you. There are antidotes to pick up downed players, a lethal injection to instakill someone you think is infected, and a scanner that can help you scan and find out if a person is infected too.

The LIES!!!!!! I can't tell you how many times I've fallen for them, and yet, I myself have played the tune of terror as well and have framed innocent people! Either way, even though the point is to never trust anything someone is saying unless you see it with your own eyes, my trust in these people is forever changed! :3

Thanks for letting me share! If you made it this far, I'll share some tattoo tax, since I think it's the new trend now :D

Finally got around to playing MGSV; Quiet is so much worse than I thought,"Wow. Like honestly wow. Kojima you outdid yourself on being a creepy, immature bastard.

Quiet in this game is a waking nightmare of the most disgusting, crass objectification, brutalization, and humiliation female characters face in video games and popular media in general. I have literally never seen such a thoroughly disgusting display of sexism and perversion on this level.

Quiet is so much worse than simply being a female character in a sexualized outfit. I've seen that before. I hate it, but I'm used to it. Literally everything about Quiet - every aspect of her characterization, every moment of screentime she occupies - is designed to turn Quiet into a submissive sexual object. 

She doesn't speak, which wouldn't be a problem if she still displayed some form of agency without words. Aside from her introduction where she tries to kill Snake (on the orders of another man) and a few scenes where she beats up some Mother Base soldiers for implicit sexual harassment (and oh boy we'll get to that shit later), Quiet does nothing but submit to Snake and his cohorts the entire game, despite literally being an assassin sent on a mission to kill him and his whole operation. The reason for this is apparently nothing more than Quiet being totally, innately brought down by Snake's sheer macho power and sex appeal and not actively trying to kill her once she's back on Mother Base. She remains a subservient, passive, loyal companion throughout the rest of the game, literally only existing as either a sex object or a weapon who doesn't even fire her weapon unless ordered to do so by Snake. Her story culminates with her sacrificing her life for Snake, because of course it does, but not before she is almost raped by a bunch of Soviet soldiers, which I shouldn't be surprised by since I'm pretty sure creators like Kojima are physically incapable of writing stories without at least one gratuitous instance of sexual violence. Oh but don't worry, she ends up ""empowered"" by having her pants ripped off so she can murder her assaulters in a fetishized action sequence.

And lets talk about how she's physically presented because ""male gaze"" doesn't even cut how fucking disgusting it is. Like the rest of the buddies in the game, you can gain bond levels with Quiet to access more abilities and weapons for her. Like the other buddies, one of the ways to do this is by taking her on missions and using her abilities. Unlike the other companions, it is also built by interacting with her between missions. When I say ""interacting"", by the way, I literally mean staring at her. You actually get extra bonding points if you stare at her breasts. As you build your bond level with her, she starts to pose for Snake in the chopper. When you reach max bond level with her, she will approach Snake in the chopper and bend over to display her breasts, then turn around and get in a cat pose to show off her ass. Back at Mother Base, she will get up from her bed to slowly snake her way across her cage while sensually staring at Snake before showering. In cutscenes, the camera practically licks its way across her breasts and ass like a wet tongue, taking every opportunity to reduce her to a disjointed series of sexual body parts whenever possible.

There's so much more I could say, like how Quiet is the only female presence in the game aside from Paz, who appears as some sort of hospital waifu fever vision to Snake, and the random female soldiers you can recruit to Mother Base (oh yeah there's the female Skulls too. [This is how they are introduced.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFF9XglJAJc) I want to actually fucking die now thanks). The level of casual sexism and misogyny concentrated into Quiet is frankly remarkable. And don't even get me started on how people dismiss gross shit like this by saying ""it's Kojima!! He's just weird like that!!!"". I fucking detest whenever any creator (and they're always male creators) reach untouchable auteur status and everything they do is beyond criticism. Fuck that, and fuck Kojima for creating a character as detestable and regressive as Quiet. Fuck him for putting gratuitous, needless sexual violence in his games. Fuck him for apparently not being able to design a female character without giving her at least a plunging neckline. Fuck him for a lot of things. I'm already dreading what kind of gross shit he's put in *Death Stranding*, especially given the absolutely creepy way he's discussed Lea Seydoux and Lindsay Wagner. I'm sure he'll get away with it then too.",GirlGamers

Noise Enforcer,"I've gone through the usual nonsense female gamers get.

-You're a girl?  Daddy will carry you.
-This match isn't going well, blame the girl.
-You're playing that character because you're a girl, that's what girls play.
-Girls should just play healers.
-She's actually good for a girl.
-Crazy PMs.

Etcetera.

But the other day I got my first taste of a bit of crazy I never would have thought of.

Here I am, playing Overwatch with a friend.  I caught a yawn, did a full body stretch.  My yawn was audible and I made one of those involuntary stretch noises.

Almost immediately the guy I was playing with starts this conversation.

""Stop that.  Don't make those noises.""

""What?  What are you talking about?""

""You know what I'm talking about.  I watched a youtube video all about a streamer girl who would make arousing sounds 'accidentally' and pretend she didn't mean to.""

""Um...okay, well I was yawning and stretching.""

""Sure you were.""

His tone was between deadpan and patronizing.  The 'I-don't-care-what-you're-saying-I-know-better-and-I'm-right' tone.

Are you kidding me?  You're scolding me for making normal body sounds because something-something sexy streamer you heard about?  Was that even true or more boys deciding the girl was trying to arouse them with normal noises?  His tone continued to be pretty similar for awhile, so he was some kind of upset still over it.

Definitely was not trying to seduce you, sir.  But you definitely made me uncomfortable deciding that I was.  I cannot imagine one of my guy friends making that kind of weird accusation at another guy.  

Anyone had this happen?  Heard of this sexy streamer?  Have their own weird gamer girl stories?

Game suggestions?,"Hi all!

I've been out of gaming for a bit and I wanted to get back into it and wanted to see if you guys had any recommendations for me?

I'm a pc gamer and I love RPG's.  However, I really like playing online and forming a community with others as well (though I guess I'm ok if it's just single player!).  I tried out Destiny 2 with a friend a few months ago and I really liked it but it seemed more like a solo player game where other people happened to be as well.

I tried WOW for a little bit but didn't keep going because 1. Though the world was beautiful, the graphics kind of took away from the experience for me, 2. Maybe this was just because I was low level, but again it just seemed like a solo player game where other people happened to be.

Any suggestions?

Games that lost their magic on replay,"I used to like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time when I was a kid, and I recently decided to replay the game, and the protagonist still remain one of the best written male characters I've ever seen in a video game and the level design is great and even the graphics hold up really well for a game that old. 

But, the game also has severe camera issues I didn't notice or cared much about as a kid. For example, the camera suddenly switches direction during difficult platform segments and fight scenes, and I died several times because an odd camera angle made me miscalculate a jump or because the monsters I was fighting ended up blocked from my view by a pillar in front of the camera. And worst of all, *every time* the camera changes angle there is a ""Whoosh!"" sound effect, which didn't seem that bad at first but became infuriating towards the end of the game.

DAE get really bothered by everyone assuming youre male unless otherwise,"its especially ""triggering"" for me because im trans and im really sick of being referred to as a male, to say the least.  but its like its uncomfortable for them if youre not one of them.  they say ay bro in an almost questioning way like, are you cool, are you a dude, you gotta be cool, and you gotta be a dude. maybe i feel that pressure because i was born/assigned male, but its aggravating.  i get the communal spirit of being ""a bro"", but its also a coldhearted tough love community that i fucking cant cope with.  so maybe im bothered for no reason, according to them, but just wondered if other girls are irked at the very least.   i know bringing it up in itself is a problem, because then im the special snowflake thats too bothered by things that shouldnt bother me.  but i feel thats them talking from a group, and its easier to feel superior when inside a group.  idk if im even making sense, i just hate the gaming community a lot, and am always at odds and just standing up for myself gets attacked as ""taking it personally"" and ""triggered"" and whatever else.  doesnt help that using a voice comm online would get me gendered male, which i guess from a cis female perspective might be seen as a good thing, because they'll take me more seriously because of my male voice, which is privilege, even if i despise my male voice.   just ranting now, sorry. i come off like im playing the victim and asking for pity :/  is what it is",GirlGamers

So I got into Monster Hunter World...,"...but I started playing just as my period had begun. It was late and I was smashing monster's heads when suddenly I felt really bad - they're kinda cute, ya know? And like, I know the Elder Dragon's a big issue, but what about the others? Why am I killing them all and making armour out of their families? Hohh my god I'm an awful person. So I started capturing ONLY because it made me feel a bit better, but as I was fighting a Diablos (one of my favs) I brought my hammer down... and he DIED. I thought he had enough health left and I had my pitfall trap ready... my hunter cheered triumphantly. I started tearing up. Now hear me out, at this point it was 5am and I was running on iced coffee alone. My mental state was not good. Before I knew it, I was crying. I quit the game and went to bed. When I woke up about an hour ago, my period had begun, and all I could think was ""... oh."" 

Any of you guys ever suffer from heightened emotions and get overly dramatic while gaming on your period? Also, who here is playing Monster Hunter World? I'm kinda crap and get sad over killing the monsters, but I'd be down to play with others. Lemme know in the comments - I'll be trying to read them!",GirlGamers

About no man‚Äôs sky‚Äôs lack of gender choice,"I‚Äôve seen many people around the internet being disappointed that, in no man‚Äôs sky‚Äôs latest update which let‚Äôs you customize the appearance of your character, there‚Äôs no option to make your character a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù. Some people say it‚Äôs enough for them to not play it and to you I ask your attention. 

It‚Äôs no surprise that we live in a patriarchal society and that men, especially in gaming, are seen as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, while women are supposedly the ‚Äúexception‚Äù. We are all socialized to believe that men are the default, I‚Äôm therefore not blaming you or anyone for believing that the lack of gender option means you‚Äôre stuck to being a man, especially since there are games with character customization that only allow for male characters. 

But no man‚Äôs sky is not that way, and it‚Äôs pretty explicit about it. Since launch, every npc you meet as been referred to with the pronouns ‚Äúthey/them‚Äù. I know it‚Äôs not the biggest flashiest sign, they don‚Äôt advertise it or anything but it‚Äôs there. The game exists outside of gender, none of the aliens are strictly male or female, therefore neither is your character. Even when you meet with characters with the names of ‚ÄúArtemis‚Äù or ‚ÄúApollo‚Äù who are originally Greek gods with gender, the game uses gender neutral pronouns. The game isn‚Äôt erasing women from its story, it‚Äôs creating a world outside of gender and any perceived idea of gender is really only put their by our own human perspective. So please don‚Äôt write it off as another male centric game because it‚Äôs so much more. 

Fuck the gender binary anyway ",GirlGamers

Used to be big into PlayStation when I was young. Wanna get into P.C gaming. Help?,"Okay so my brother was always a big console gamer.  So when I was young my sisters and I used to always play on his PS1/2/3(not so much). We played ALL the games because he used to trade, so there was always something new(to us) to play. Thankfully he has quite good taste and didn't just play one kind of game. I did do P.C gaming aswell, Skyrim, Thief, The Sims, WoW that sort of thing.

Anyways its been several years since Iv touched a console and I don't think Iv actually ever played an xbox. I desperately want to get back into gaming, this time with a P.C. I sort of didn't do anything for a few years because of mental health problems, but Iv been slowly getting my sh!t together. So this is a thing I'm doing for me. Honestly, missing something  and remembering how much I enjoyed doing something is kind of a big thing with depression. So yeah, I'm finally working properly even if it is only part-time. so I have money! Yahoo lol

I'm not knowledgeable about building my own computer whatsoever, but I have 2 friends and my brother who have been doing it for years. So with their help I put together a list and they have approved it ha. I gave them a budget of E700 for the components. Now we are hoping to get a good deal on a graphics card on Black Friday/Cyber Monday and if we do then that changes some things. My brother is currently upgrading his system, so if he gets lucky in the sales then I might get some parts off him, saving me money yay. I will be 'borrowing' a decent monitor, keyboard and mouse. So I will be saving up for them at a later stage. I will however need to get a desk and chair. I might just make my own desk because my bedroom is a weird shape and just..awkward. i have zero real idea on what makes a good chair.

So ladies, I would love if ye could give opinions on the list of parts. then what kind of chairs, monitors, keyboards(mechanical please), mouse ye use, or are good budget options etc. [List of parts.](https://fr.pcpartpicker.com/list/6mcbTB)

Need help with improving skill with my controller - Draonball Fighterz,"Hi there! The majority of the games I play are on my PC so I am more used to playing games with the keyboard and mouse. My boyfriend got me Dragonball Fighterz on Steam for my birthday, a game I REALLY want to play! However, I absolutely suck at landing the combos to execute the special moves with the controller I plug into the USB. I have done all the tutorials and spammed the practice arenas in the try mode to do them over and over so I could build some sort of muscle memory but still, I cannot for the life of me easily make the combos work for the special moves. It's super frustrating. The combos I'm referencing are for example the down arrow + RL or up arrow + RL, etc. Do you guys have any tips or if any of you had the same struggle did you find a certain make/brand of controller to be easier?

What could cause my finger pain?,"I get a pain in the tip of my index finger, in the middle, if I touch something. It feels like a pin or needle.

If I continue touching and pressing with it, then it goes away, but it ""recharges"" after a few minutes and hurts again if I touch something.

I switched my mouse since about a week ago to a new one, a [Steelseries Rival 110](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-110). It feels comfortable, but I do notice something about it. The surface of the buttons are tilted outwards and my index finger is pressed slightly on the right side of it, not really in the middle. (This happens on the old mouse too, but less.)

The old mouse was a Gigabyte [M6980X](https://www.gigabyte.com/Mouse/M6980X).

My hand size is 20,5 cm √ó 19,5 cm.
My grip is like a flat fingertip grip, and the mouse is pushed to where the base of my little finger is. They never feel strained.

The pain started about 2 days ago.
First I thought it's a splinter, but I dismissed the idea since it goes away with pressing, and there is nothing visible that looks like a splinter.

How do you feel about girl gamer stereotypes? Do they affect how you play games?,"So I'll be the first to (proudly) admit that I'm about as stereotypical as girl gamer gets. I have every single Sims expansion pack. Sometimes I replay Pokemon X and Y just so I can dress up my player character. I've spent unimaginable hours modding every game I can just so I can give my characters pretty hair and longer eyelashes, I love dress up games, I almost only play female champions in League, I own all the star guardian skins, I main support in Overwatch, the first skill in Runescape I maxed out was cooking... I pretty much check all the boxes. (also, it will never fail to crack me up that most of the guys who make fun of me for only maxing cooking/fishing/woodcutting/firemaking in rs eventually end up admitting that they haven't maxed a single skill... like ????)

I feel like, for a really long time, I was really worried about people not taking me seriously because my interests in games were so feminine. I'd always pretend that I didn't play the sims or care about character customization, because if I admitted to it, guys would always make fun of me for being an ""e-girl"" and all that entailed. Like, I genuinely felt horribly guilty for liking the things I liked because I thought they meant I wasn't a ""real gamer"" (because apparently the sims isn't a real video game, because it's not a super manly fps...), even though having stereotypically feminine interests in games is just as valid as only playing fps games (or whatever ""real gamers"" play).

Did you guys ever feel guilty for fitting into any stereotypes about female gamers?

(Help/Advice greatly appreciated) Two questions to all female overwatch players:,"One: I'm stuck in silver right now on console and don't really seem to be climbing at all even though I feel that I've improved greatly. I've read that communication really is key to winning games, but I feel very awkward being the only one shotcalling (or speaking in general) and if someone does come on, It's normally them saying either a) shut uppppp girlllll or b) some other sexist sentence. I've tried LFG and joined ""Comms only"" groups, but I mostly feel too shy to talk, especially when all the other mics are all men/boys (I don't know why, I'm more shy around guys then girls). I've also joined an Overwatch girl gamers discord, but most of the time no one is really on console at the same time I am playing. What tips do you guys have?

Two: Does anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid the whole ""Girls should play Mercy"" thing? I must say that I really enjoy Mercy's playstyle because I enjoy assisting my team - I don't feel like I need to be the one getting all the kills or POTG. But it gets much harder when you have people telling you that OF COURSE you play Mercy, you're female. It just irks me and makes me want to switch, but a) I don't want to, because as I said earlier, I really enjoy playing as Mercy, and b) I am mostly (at least at Silver) the only healer in my group - the rest are DPS mains trying to get POTG or the occasional tank. What should I do?

Abusive ex boyfriend twitch streams and it makes me mad.

Unfortunately, he was still trying to talk to me while dating another woman secretly on twitch while we were broken up (literally was trying to get me to come back to his house). He streams on twitch all the time, and honestly it makes me sick how fake he acts around those other people. I feel so petty, because I felt fine until I figured out about the other girl, and now I feel sick everyday, because when I learned about the other girl, I went off on him, and then he ghosted me and called me a crazy ex girlfriend.

Have you ever played Resonance of Fate/End of Eternity?,"When I came around to playing it, I was intrigued by the setting, the story at first was reminding me of old fantasy RPGs and the fighting mechanics were creative. In fact I spend the first few hours grinding just because it was so fun.

You take control of a small group of three characters, Vashyron, Zephyr and Leanne. For all of them there are many outfit choices and you can combine those of one character in different ways. In the opening movie Leanne, the only girl out of these three, is shown to make a suicide attempt but is saved by Zephyr. Despite that, Vashyron and Zephyr would always give her smack, tell her to make food or peeve on her. Even after I leveled her immensely as she was my preferred character, they would still criticize her before and after many enemy encounters. As the story episodically ""progressed"" (it did not really though) at one time Leanne got sick and could not go on adventure. I was left with Vashyron and Zephyr to retrieve some medicine from a facility overrun with enemies. This proved to be stupendously difficult with only two party members. And afterwards Leanne's level was not even adjusted. Some episodes later, I was already pretty angry at how she was treated throughout the game, Leanne was removed from the party again. Only this time because Vashyron and Zephyr had practically bullied her into prostitution (no offense against sexual labour intended from my side), because they wanted something from an important but enormously creepy church member.

A parody on how to design a AAA video game hero,,GirlGamers
Long-term harassment in game,"I'm not even sure where to start this... I've been gaming most of my adult life and have encountered several creeps in my time. Out of all of those encounters there is one creep that will not leave me alone. I'm past annoyed at this point, I'm angry. This has been going on for eight years now.

Before this began he was an on and off again member of my guild and we had many mutual friends. We chatted and played together in game, that was it. I started dating someone and that's when all this started, creeper threw me a bunch of rude messages regarding my new partner, said that he had always loved me and would die for me.

I blocked him and quit playing shortly after that happened, but one of those mutual friends leaked my real name to him and he started messaging me on social media. I blocked him there and cut off all contact with that group for awhile.  I started playing again on a new server with a new name about a year or so after his last contact. I dont know how he found me that time but there he was on the same server as me. I stopped playing again but I missed the good friends I did have in game so I came back and took over my old guild, removed anyone I knew that was associated with him that I couldn't trust and moved us to a new server. Here lies the biggest problem, he finds me because of my guild now. Our name is the same as it was all those years ago and I'm not willing to change it because it's something we all take pride in. I think this is what makes me the angriest because I know in order to completely stop being harassed by him I would have to leave my team behind and that's not something I should have to do.

More recently he's been trying to add me every few weeks and I've continued to block those tags. Now hes moved onto creating characters on my server and whispering me from them. Always being annoying but never saying enough to actually make it so he could get in trouble with a game master. I've talked to cs about it but there is nothing they can do about new characters in game sending me messages. I guess I should have reported it more back in the day instead of just blocking.

I honestly dont know how to deal with this anymore. I have told him in the past I want nothing to do with him but he keeps trying to make contact. I'm tired of blocking character after character. I want to lash out and say something very very mean to him but the rational side of me is like ""No, that will just give him what he wants.""

This has also made me incredibly hesitant to start content creating and streaming the game I love so much because I know eventually he's going to find me.

Thank you for reading this and if you have any ideas on how to deal with this feel free to share. Also yes posting from an alt account because my team and the creep know my name on here.

Ps. I dont know how to flair this the new reddit layout is confusing..

Edit: Thank you all for the support and suggestions. I have been keeping screenshots of when he tries to add or message me, I will be trying to open a ticket with the game devs tomorrow and see if there is anything else they can do. Hopefully I will get someone who understands because as one of you pointed out yes it is against the TOS to create characters and do that I never thought to point it out to them before. If they can't do anything I will call the police and see if they can do something, which I'm not sure they can, but it can't hurt to call right? I do have his real name but that is all I know about him.

Also I would like to add that if anyone reading this is going thru anything remotely similiar, please keep proof of what they are saying to you. Screenshot everything and do it early, don't wait till its been years.

Edit #2: I heard back from the dev's today and was told that they investigated things from their end and will take appropriate action but cannot discuss the action taken due to privacy. Fairly typical response I suppose but that doesn't tell me whether or not they are actually doing anything which is frustrating but I get it. They told me I need to block one of his characters on all of mine to block the account fully in game which makes no sense to me but I'll give it a try. They said if he bypasses that then to report it and it will build on top of this report and more serious action will be taken on their account. Overall I'm happy you all encouraged me to finally open a ticket. Thank you again for all the support, you are all great people  &lt;3",GirlGamers

So I tried a PC game instead, but a lot of these games seem to be Japanese, so like ok I pick up one recommended for women (cause like as much as I don't care of the gender fxf, fxm, mxm, FxF written for men just idk it has its moments where it makes my skin crawl?!?!) Which was interesting, not quite what I expected. But had it rear it's ugly head with some really gross anime type sterotypes I am just really not a fan of.

So I was wondering what do you guys think? Is there any good ones out there? Or have you had just as bad luck trying them out? It seems like very neat in theory... but harder to enjoy for me.",GirlGamers

I've beaten Ironclad Asc 12, Silent Asc 14, Defect Asc 12, and all I seem to do is the same decks every time:  
Ironclad: Shrug, Shrug, Entrench, Slam, Slam, with the occasional Offering, Barricade, Rage, Battle Trance, Flex etc.  
Silent: Footwork x5, Backflip, Backflip, Escape Plan, Blur and just wait for them to die from Noxious Fumes/Crippling Poison/Deadly Poison. Throw in a Burst if lucky.  
Defect: Claw, Claw, Claw, All For One, Claw, Claw, Claw, Scrape, Claw, Claw, Claw, Reboot, Claw, Claw, Claw, Claw, Claw. Throw in a Hyperbeam if lucky.

So this happened at work Thursday night. I started  a new job 2 weeks ago and met this girl in my training glass we will call her Sam. Her and I have been training together since so we mainly just talk to each other. I found out Thursday night that she and her boyfirend likes and plays video games. So we started talking about the New Fallout 76, TLOU2, and E3 2018. This made me excited because I just found a potential couple that my fiance and I can play with online. So naturally I asked her what her Gamer tag is? This is the part of the story that let me down. She says , ""Oh, I have no Idea what my gamer tag is. I didnt make it my self. My boyfriend made it for me. So I dont know what it is"".  My question is if you play games whether it's on Ps4, Xbox, PC, etc... shouldn't you know your Gamer tag?

[Vent] Apparently all girls who are duoing are trying to get boosted!,"Honestly I'm getting really sick of the League of Legends community.

Duoing with my friend means that he's trying to get in my pants right? And that I, like all other female gamers, belong in a kitchen making sandwiches while ""delusional eboys"" boost me to an undeserved rank? And then when my friend starts to get mad and defend himself (our team started to call him degrading names, specifically ""fag"" and that really upset him because he has been dealing with homophobia all his life), he gets called a white-knight. It's like most of these players have never spoken to a woman before. It's just baffling that a functional human being thinks this way. 

At its core, I really enjoy the game. I love to queue up with my friends and mess around in normals, but that doesn't happen much since our schedules don't align. I queue ranked for more serious gameplay, but instead what I get are incels. Sure there's always muting and reporting, but it's not right that I have to deal with people like that just because I happen to be a female that plays support. Is there any reason for me to still play this game? Are there better ways to deal with this? Even though I've had this happen to me for a long time, it's still just as frustrating. ",GirlGamers
Pendula Swing - Tolkien meets The Great Gatsby in a new episodic adventure game set in a fantasy version of the Roaring 20s,"Hey everyone, and thank you, GirlGamers, for your kind approval to post about our game here.

**About Pendula Swing**

Pendula Swing is an episodic adventure game set in a fantasy version of the 1920s. You play as Brialynne, an old lady dwarf who was once the most famous hero of Pendula. She however retired on her idyllic, secluded island, to spend her days with her love, the healer Taheena. 400 years after her retirement, Brialynne - now a widow - is forced to return to civilisation. She discovers a fascinating new world, where glamour hides far darker stories. 

Pendula Swing Episode 1 and 2 will be launched on August 15.   You can wishlist them 
**[HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/840290/Pendula_Swing_Episode_1__Tired_and_Retired/)** and **[HERE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/861950/Pendula_Swing_Episode_2__The_Old_Heros_New_Journey/)**. Episode 1 will be free and Episode 2 will cost USD 4,99. We hope you like the concept enough to wishlist our game!

**About Valiant Game Studio**

[Valiant](https://twitter.com/Valiant_GS) is founded by [Anna Jenelius](https://twitter.com/TheAnaka) and [Laura Bularca](https://twitter.com/sarienn), sharing a combined experience in the games industry of over 15 years. We are joined by Eva Sokolova, who is our wonderful artist. We work with a handful of freelancers on a per need basis, and we are happy to say that most of our freelancers are ladies, too. This is an unintended but happy fact - we hope that the subject, setting, our team and culture draws the interest of lady developers :).

We are inspired by TV series for our games. TV series have short but catchy episodes. Many series tackle actual and important subjects from politics, business, relations and more. We believe that our world and our history is rich of interesting settings, situations and stories and that games can do a great job leveraging that. We want to make games that have meaningful and relevant stories. We want to bring to life unusual heroes, like the old, wise, impressive dwarf lady Brialynne. We want to provide beautiful, interactive contexts to freely talk and explore social subjects like racism, prejudice, inequality.

We know our games are not for everybody but we feel there are many like us, who crave more profound stories from games and who have unusual role models and dreams.

My wife took me to see the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra live - and the music was already pretty BEFORE an orchestra played it 50 feet in front of my face!

And now I can't stop watching the cinematics and/or listening to the soundtrack.

Aqua is my favorite character and I already played .2 fragmentary passage - so I'm a little spoiled for Dream Drop but I love all these stupid friendships so much I don't care about some spoilers.

Beyond these friendships - can we talk about how Birth By Sleep is like a very good Star Wars prequel?!  Like they pulled off an Anakin story line that is incredibly relatable and now I have to save all my children and the only ending I can take is that their stupid wayfinders bring them together again.

Curating a battle station is harder than I'd anticipated,"I'm a young woman with some (albiet small) disposable income and I'm slowly upgrading my battle station. I want to lighten up my desk and really feel proud of my hobbies and interests in the comfort of my home.

During the process of upgrading my space I've realised how incredibly aggressive gaming systems look. It is almost entirely black with red, green or blue accents, with the occasional pink or purple thrown in for good measure. The towers, the keyboards, hell even the bloody mice are angular and aggressive. It feels like the category is: teenage-edgelord-extravangza sponsored by Lynx Africa (I think it's called Axe in the US). 

I'm not saying that Edgelord eleganza is necessarily bad but it feels like these are the only options when shopping around. I really had to search hard for a simple white case of which I had to compromise on (I'm clumsy and didn't want glass but there were no other options). I'm beginning to look at mice and key caps but again, a huge amount of aggressive angular styling which is not at all my scene.

Has anyone else felt this frustration? I am beginning to get to the point where I feel overly fussy and materialistic about wanting to make my personal space more feminine and pretty because apparently it's super hard to find anything remotely neutral and stylish.

Plus I can't find many nice huge mouse mats in the UK. Which has really bummed me out.

Edit: I'm sorry. I didn't make myself clear. I have a white case now which I am happy with. It just took me way longer and the case I REALLY wanted was only made in black (it had a honeycomb like pattern that would've been so cute in white).

Open World Game Recommendations,"**Hi hi! Im brand new to reddit but so excited to have found this group/page/section/subreddit (I don't understand terminology yet) I am in desperate need of a new game, I love all the Zelda games, Fable 2 &amp; 3 (I didn't get into 1 sorry), Skyrim Elder Scrolls, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. I love open world adventure games, with fighting and if you can play as a girl its major bonus points.

Warcraft Warbringers,"The new Jaina short is out and it's amazing! I decided to check out the original trailer for them and I read the comments... big mistake.

Half of them are men having a whinge that it's all female characters. ""Wah stupid fimsims"" ""all war is caused by women"" ""pandering to sjw"". Is it not enough that almost everything else is about you? As the harbingers were male and no one cared but we've got to have a big whine because women got the spotlight ONCE.

I was going to pick Wow back up but after seeing how immature the players are I don't think I will. /rantover but I'm actually so angry haha",GirlGamers
Not Being Able to Connect with Characters Different From You,"This has been something that has always baffled me. Whether its pertaining about gaming or TV and movies, I just do not get it. How is it hard to resonate and connect with another human being? I understand how race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomics can shape us and our experiences, but the lack of will and desire to connect with someone different from you is weak to me. Being a black woman, I have been able to connect and relate to and care for so many white characters, male and female (it would be hella hard being a gamer without it). I have no problem doing it, it's not like pulling out teeth. 

I get that there are things that I deal with that a white man or woman for that matter cannot understand or truly get. But at the very least people can empathize. I get sick and tired of hearing how female characters are hard to relate to especially when it retains to woc. How the hell does one relate and connect with Link but cannot do so with Chloe Frazer?

Harassed on Twitch,"So I don't have the screenshot anymore because I banned the user, but I just started streaming on Twitch like 2 weeks ago and got this exchange:

\[shitty person\]: Do you have Ligma?

me: What is that?

\[shitty person\]: Ligma balls

\[nice person who watches my stream regularly\]: wow.... that was just dumb

\[shitty person\]: bitch

Even though I banned and reported it, the account was an obvious throwaway, and this person will probably just create more accounts to harass streamers.

Anyways, I knew going in that streaming wasn't going to be a 100% positive experience. I'm just still taken aback that people will go around just saying shitty things like this. 

**EDIT:** The part that bothers me is that the person immediately went from shitty joke to kind of aggressive profanity...not so much the shitty joke.",GirlGamers

Not sure where to start though.

Seasonings seems like a good place to start, but it doesn't make for good video content on its own.

I'm also wondering if anyone knows of a sortable food database or spreadsheet type thingy that would make it easy to begin putting things together and planning.

What foods do you think would be a good place to start?

Any suggestions for organization?

"Women of Tabletop: Where are all the articles, youtube channels, and podcasts??","I'm an old, female gamer. Been gaming since 1994 and while I've never had too much trouble finding comfortable gaming environments, it's only in the past... 5 or so years that I've really seen this beloved hobby (read: obsession) of mine flourish with female gamers. 

A wee bit of backstory: I started with Wargaming and moved into Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, dipped my toes into MtG competitively for a while before college then quit both wargaming and card games  (I was a poor lass and most of my troops and decks were made illegal for play) and dove headlong into Dungeons and Dragons, which by then was 3.0 then eventually became 3.5. Switched to Pathfinder because I loathed 4.0 and while 5.0 isn't my favorite, my husband likes it so I sometimes play a session.

Oh, and I've been a dungeon master almost as long as I've been a player. I love it more than breathing. (And who doesn't love breathing?)

Now. In this era of inclusion. This dawn of ""everyone's invited"". I find the online community really lacking... 

Sure, there's a podcast or two of ""female only roleplayers"" or even a twitch channel here and there. But where are the reviews? Articles? Tips and tricks???

I typed in a simple question into Google. ""Female players playing male characters"" with either DnD or Pathfinder added interchangeably. Not only did I find NOTHING related to my ask (and yeah, I tried different combinations. My Google-fu is strong.) but I stumbled upon an article here on reddit that posited women were biologically unfit for playing tabletop games (Dude, really?). 

Now, don't take my frustration for anger. 

I've seen female youtubers who dip their toes into what I'm talking about - the ""tabletop crafting"" community is full of women crafting miniatures, their own dice, terrain, etc etc and there's even a group of them steadily growing. My husband adores them, as do I.

But finding women talking about rulesets, play styles, strategies, builds, reviewing books... Is it an empty barren field? Am I wrong?

I'd love your help on this.

Treated like a child during Left 4 Dead 2,"I was playing a public game with my boyfriend and two random guys. They were incredibly talkative bordering on annoying. I‚Äôve been playing this game for about a month now, and while I‚Äôm not the greatest player ever, I‚Äôm still pretty damn good. Since they were so chatty and nice, I thought it would be fun to talk too and at first it was well received and they were super nice to me.  I tend to hang back a little to kill any stragglers, or since I‚Äôm obsessed with the boomer bile and katana, I‚Äôm typically looking for those in places. We made it about 30 minutes into the game before I accidentally got cornered by a tank, I hung back a little too far and was incapacitated, so one of the guys who was closest came back and revived me. After that he kept making comments about not leaving me behind and would constantly follow me and try to ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù. It felt like they were waiting for me to fuck up so they had a reason to babysit me. I know it‚Äôs small compared to the other shit that‚Äôs been said/done in games to women, but it made me feel like I was dumb in a game I normally feel really confident in. ",GirlGamers

Girly but not Glowing,"Hi! I'm looking into building my first desktop in the next few months! I unfortunately *really* hate how everything glows and want that down to a minimum. I've been looking into solid cases, but they're typically matte black or rather expensive (I'd like to stick under $100 if possible). My laptop right now is red &amp; black, so its not the biggest issue, but if I'm putting the time and money into it, I want it to be something I love.

I'd like to find something that's a bit more girly or dressed up than just a solid black borg tower. Seen some brushed steel cases, which don't look too bad, but I'm fully on board the rose gold train or would like something pink/pearlized but not pepto-bismal pink (love the color in small amounts, and my sailor moon stuff will already fill that quota for me). Or is there a way I could customize it myself without it looking too arts &amp; crafts (as in child-like, I'd kill for a William Morris inspired case, even though he's rolling in his grave at that haha). 

Does anybody have some advice or can point me in the right direction? I've been looking at PC Part Picker, Amazon, and New Egg.

getting unfair treatment and being downgraded because you're a girl who plays games,"hey guys.  I'm sick of being treated like im subpar compared to guys who play the same video games as me. since im a girl and im usually the only girl who plays video games with a bunch of guys, all my guy friends just treat me as if I'm worse than them. I always feel like I have an inferiority complex and I _always_ have to prove them wrong and make sure I do well in-game. it's so fucking annoying when you always hear ""but you're a girl, why are you playing games?"" ""ah you're a girl. of course you'd play this champion (referring to league of legends)  or use this particular gun (referring to cs:go)"" that only """"""""""girls"""""""""" stereotypically use. and the fact that you ALWAYS get discredited when you achieve something fantastic in ranked/competitive games, like ""Oh she's a girl. she probably had some other guy helping her get that rank. that wasn't her own skill"". like cmon that shit is whack. after getting so much fucking shit from guys after you haven't being playing that well in games and BLAMING IT on the fact that you're a girl, IT JUST GETS TOO MUCH for me to handle. I'm so fucking TIRED of guys just downgrading my ability to play video games because I'm a girl and immediately assuming that I'm going to be a shitty player. it fucking irritates the FUCK out of me. okay I'm done with my rant. do you guys have any similar stories?

I always give the same answer of, why does it fucking matter, can we just play this game? But last night was really bad. He started yelling at me that I was going to hell and that I was an IT. I'm a 32 married cis woman, not that it matters, but what the actual hell? He kept voting to kick me every few minutes, but luckily there was one guy on the team that wasn't an ass-hat. 

Is this the new version of being called a f*g with Gen Z? What the hell is going on?

It is the first time a guy has crossed the line from trying to be ""funny"" to actually abusive and hostile. I of course reported him but I don' think it is going to end up as a ban or anything. I also reported his steam profile because when I looked him up it is COVERED in nazi flags. ",GirlGamers

Rainbow Six Siege and FPSes - The worst genre when it comes to sexism? [Also looking for friends to play with!],"  After a God awful night trying to play R6S with a lady friend of mine, it occurred to me - the worst experiences I've had as far as gaming and communities go has always been with first person shooters. From Call of Duty, to Counter-Strike, it seems that this specific genre communities have the most problem when dealing with women, and in truth I can't really think why. While I have had bad experiences in MMOs and Strategy games, nothing ever came close to the deluge of slurs and threats that the FPS communities seem to be. What are your theories on this? Is it because FPS is relatively new when it comes to videogames in general? I swear to Christ, it seems every other game has always that one guy that makes the night seem even worse, so much so that me and my friend are almost afraid to use mics and we don't unless it's 100&amp;#37; necessary for a game. My gaming nights became so much better once I deactivated voice and text chat on most of my games, but it is really necessary for FPS games.   


Also, on another note, me and my lady friend are definetly looking for other girls to play some Siege with us on PC. Just PM me if you're interested.  Legitimately tired of douchey dudes on public lobbies.",GirlGamers

Thank you for changing my mind,"I had a really stressful period in my life about ten years ago so there was a gap where I did not keep up with popular games at the time. For a few years I didn't mind that I'd missed out and then when I did mind I figured it was too late and the games would have aged too much for me to enjoy them. 

Recently I ran out of games to play around the time I was reading a thread here about games we keep going back to and DA:Origins was mentioned. Instead of playing Persona 5 for the third time I decided to give DA:Origins a try and I am so happy I did. It's aged sure but still a lot of fun and because I've played Inquisition it's been amazing to put some of the pieces together and understand the references to this game. 

Thank you so much to those people who are so hooked on this game after all this time for convincing me that it was not too late.",GirlGamers

Storytime: Dying Light in the middle of the Night,"After rushing through the campaign of dying light and becoming seemingly addicted to both the gameplay and the storytelling, I remembered seeing a difficulty screen pop up on the main menu when I first started playing. I knew this was the perfect opportunity to create a hardcore difficulty save which gives you limited stamina, less health, more susceptible to damage and lessens your ability to heal yourself. I also took it upon me to play the whole game with the night hunter mode on, which would allow player zombies to come and attempt to terrify me. I once again fell in love with the story. It was like watching your favourite movie for the second time, meeting all the characters again, seeing everyone feel much more different towards me, and knowing everyone's ulterior motives; it all just made it feel so carefully and excellently written. (Massive spoiler, don't open it unless you've played the game.)&gt;!The most shocking part being when Rais says that he believes he knows who you are.!&lt; 

So I was going along my own business, making sure I complete every single side-quest available, when all of a sudden I'm joined by this random person. I had no clue that my lobby was open, so my first reaction was to be a bit wary and maybe even prepare to kick him. However that wasn't the case. This person offered me some extremely powerful weaponry from the endgame, which I said I couldn't accept due to the difficulty I want, and he agreed to use less powerful weapons too in the meantime. He then suggested we do the DLC mission, which I wasn't even aware a had. And that adventure was so amazing. We stormed the &gt;!prison!&lt; together and cleared out endless waves of gunmen and zombies, and he showed me all kinds of cool gizmos to take them down like freezing crossbow bolts and explosive arrows. I had a few of my own tricks like dropkicking enemies and throwing my cheaply fashioned metal pipes at them. We had to really combine our heads to get past some of the locked doors. At one point, I honestly felt like I was in a zombie apocalypse when I told him to keep them busy for a few seconds while I picked a lock to get us through to the next zone. However that soon felt more like a comedy movie once I turned around with the door unlocked to see he had just finished killing the volatiles. We escaped the &gt;!prison!&lt; with so much loot, and I was amazed at just how good some it was, whilst still being in my level range.

However, all good things must come to an end, and it was time to say goodnight to this friend that I had just made. We added each other on steam and bid farewell, and I went to sleep as it was getting late. 

The next evening, I was completing some of the side quests at night, when all of a sudden the clear daylight sky went to pitch black, and in a span of a second, the game had told me I was being invaded. I was so scared, I had never been chased by any volatiles at night on this save, let alone by a night hunter itself. I immediately ran towards the safe zone and managed to get inside without encountering the beast. For a split second I was relieved, but then the night hunter began to type to me in chat, taunting me to come out and fight in fair combat. I thought he was out of his mind, how am I, a simple runner, supposed to take down such a potent adversary. I just bolted out of the back exit of the tower and dashed towards the objective in the hopes of reaching there before him, but instead I was met with the most unpleasant shriek I've ever heard, followed by tentacles wrapping around me at an alarming rate. I was scared shitless (sorry for my French), and to make matters worse, the monster turned my incapacitated self to face it, and then bit my entire head off. I never wanted to go through anything like that again, I just stayed at the safe zone after I respawned, and told him that I refuse to play against him anymore. That's when the kindest act imaginable occurred. The night hunter I was playing against not only said he'd teach me how to fight properly against him, but he also seemed pretty apologetic. We spent the next quarter of an hour sparring, with him giving me the opportunity to find the right timings for dodging and how to effectively use my flashlight. After the match ended, we said our goodbyes and I thanked him as well.

Now here's the good part. Later that evening, that friend that I had made the previous day asked if we could play again, and I was all for it. However he wanted me to turn off night invasions. I wanted to impress him by showing him how well I can take them down, so I decided to keep it on and taunt him a little. We were in the middle of doing a story mission in the middle of the night, when we got invaded by a random night hunter. Then two other people joined our server to help us, and all of a sudden, I was leading on an attack to destroy this night hunter's nest. It felt amazing dropkicking the night hunter in the chest, watching somebody so powerful just fall down two stories in slow motion. Then my friend got in on the action a bit, we ended up defeating the night invader, killing it more times than it had killed us. This was the most fun I've had in a while when it comes to video games, and I highly suggest this game to everyone if you wish to feel like an empowered zombie slayer like me!",GirlGamers

Suggestion for f2p mmog's on PC,"Hi!  
I'm a Uruguayan (time zone UTC-3) male gamer, that lives with his girlfriend and am looking for f2p mmogs for her with the intention to help her make new friends.    
You see, she is quite reserved and has difficulties making new friends, but once you go through the external ice wall she's an amazing person and an exceptional good friend.  
Her interests regarding games are mostly shooters, but she has also been playing a few RPG's and loves the progression system and variety of options on them. Obviously, it has to be a non toxic, girl gamer friendly environment, that's why I'm posting here :)  
About her personal interests in life, they are varied and go from singing (she's a dramatic soprano that wants to become an opera singer someday) to drag-queen stylr makeup and a fan of the Kardashians haha she's a goth, plays guitar, is a cinephile and we've been together on the most perfect relationship for 2 years already &lt;3 she watches movies unsubtitled (meaning her dominion of English is very good) and is curious about the different cultures in the world.  
We have considered Warframe, Path of Exile, Guild Wars, Tera (BTW, I almost forgot... She HATES 'anime aesthetics' and would prefer a game with Western aesthetics), DC Universe Online, Secret World but would like to know which one has the best community. Any suggestions?  
Thank you!

"I've just released the game I've spent a year developing myself, and you can now download it for free","Hello everyone! I've spent the last year making the script, story and graphics for a game titled **Commissar's Contrapasso**, a point and click adventure game set in WW2.

This is a project born from my passion in history as well as classic cartoons and adventure games, and I wanted to try and do a different take on a war story. This game is story-focused and has an aesthetic inspired by 1940's cartoons.

The game has a pay-what-you-want model, so you can pay for it if you wish to support a struggling artist or play it for free if you are short on cash or want to play the game before you decide whether it's worth your money. The game is currently playable in English and Swedish, but I hope to add more language options eventually and the game should be able to run on Windows and Linux.

Miffed about work situation (vent),"I work retail in a game store where, surprisingly enough, the majority of our staff is women who play games (4/6 are ladies. Go gals). I was assisting a female customer, her daughter, and her son. She was asking me plenty of questions about Nintendo and I was answering to the best of my ability. I personally don‚Äôt play Nintendo games and the only system I‚Äôve ever owned was the GameCube (Harvest Moon, am I right?). The only question I wasn‚Äôt able to answer was what ‚ÄúJame Ghost Hunter‚Äù was about. It‚Äôs apparently a new title coming out on the 3DS. I apologized, she said it was fine, and then we proceeded to the till. 

At the till is where this whole thing boils down. I‚Äôm ringing her up and she smiles at her children and looks me dead in the face ‚ÄúOh I like coming here. The people here don‚Äôt know anything at all but at least they‚Äôre fun.‚Äù 

And that just rubbed me entirely the wrong way. If you‚Äôre going to insult me, at least do so when you‚Äôve exited the store and after I‚Äôve rung you through.

Afterwards i leave and say im upset. He says i was waiting for you to get angry and go of on them and laughed. You see he stood up for this girl he hates before and he says it was because a guy was shouting at her, that being called a slut isn't half as bad.

WoW raiding/RP guild recruiting for BfA!,"Hi! I‚Äôm a trans female &amp; officer in the WoW guild Vindicated, Horde side, on the Wyrmrest Accord (NA) Server.

We‚Äôve been very active in Legion clearing heroic raids for AotCs (Nighthold, Tome &amp; Argus); holding regular guild M+ nights; RPing with guild storylines as well as one-offs; and scheduling a few random guild Rated BG nights. So with that same mindset we‚Äôre opening active recruitment back up for BfA!

**Our Policies:** We‚Äôre an LGBTQIA+ guild that also welcomes Ally recruits (Pride Ally, not WoW Alliance). We maintain a staunch anti-hate speech policy: no harassment/jokes/slurs that involve sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, classism, ableism and other explicit forms of ignorance.

**Raiding &amp; Mythics+:** regular raid and M+ nights will be starting back up in BfA.

Our raiding goals include getting AotC for each new tier ‚Äî just like we did in Legion ‚Äî and maintaining a dedicated core team so we can step into Mythic to down a few bosses. We‚Äôll never be a Cutting Edge guild, but we‚Äôd like to casually tackle Mythic while it‚Äôs still relevant for each tier.

Our raid tank and healing spots are filled, but even if you main a tank/healer, you‚Äôre welcome to DPS with us if you‚Äôd still like to be in our LGBTQIA+ &amp; Ally-friendly raid team.

As for Mythic+, all DPS &amp; Main Tanks/Healers are welcome to run guild Mythic+ groups!

Finally, our most important raiding and M+ goal that we adhere to is providing a very laid-back and chill atmosphere for all PvE content. So if you want to freak out/yell/scream during every mythic+, or about wiping on a raid boss, or even a mistake made, then this isn‚Äôt the guild for you.

**Role-Playing Events:** Our RP events are completely optional, but you‚Äôre encouraged to give them a try! We keep In Character and Out Of Character clearly separate, so our RP stories can be full of In Character drama-goodness, but once we‚Äôre done with the RP, its back to being friends &amp; guildies, killing NPC pixels and not each other.

We try to have an RP event once every other week, to every week, but random guild events happen. We‚Äôre looking to establish an RP officer to maintain an even more frequent RP event schedule.

**PvP:** We‚Äôd love to have a more regular and dedicated PvP side to the guild, and are looking to create a PvP officer position in the future. For now our PvP is very casual. And as with PvE, we're very chill about PvP: it's definitely more about fun than anything else, so no freak outs/screaming/yelling about losing/mistakes.

**Out of WoW Activities:** we‚Äôve held a few streaming nights, where we get together in Discord to watch a member play a non-WoW game. Guild Overwatch guild nights have happened as well. We plan on continuing these and other non-WoW events from time to time as a way to change up the pace.

**Joining:** Regardless of the guild activity, whether its future raiding, mythic+, RP, PvP, or even if you primarily solo but would still like a safe place to be yourself, put in an application! We love having lots of good, genuinely kind people with us, no matter what you're interested in doing. :O)

Here‚Äôs our link for filling out an application: [https://vindicated.enjin.com/recruitment](https://vindicated.enjin.com/recruitment)

Just Finished Detroit: Become Human and Loved it. This is a great game for story driven gamers who don't like combat.,"Hi All,
So I'm pretty new to this sub, didn't even know it was thing but I'm glad I found it. So I recently played Detroit:Become Human and I though it was a great game. I've always been story driven and play most of my games on the easiest mode possible with some exceptions (games like Bioshock and Halo are always played on hard) and I figured there have to be other people like me who aren't really into the combat. I guess the best way to describe this game is that it is a bunch of quick-time events. You know those cinematic fight scenes where you have to quickly push the right button at the right time or fail that action? this is basically the entire game, with timed decision making. I would watch the AngryJoe review as it's pretty accurate, but I thought some would like to know that I thought it was worth it.

[SPOILERS] NieR:Automata was amazing.,"I finished endings [A]-[E] the other day, and I was blown away.

The story was one quite possibly the best I've ever seen in a game, and the themes of existential crises, discrimination, loneliness, depression, despair, all spoke to me at a level I've never experienced in a video game before.

I've played so so many games which I've adored, which have spoken to some of my deepest desires and fears, but I've never had a game rip out my heart and nail it to the television for me to see like NieR:Automata has done.

I struggle almost daily with feeling like I don't have any meaning in life, that my heart and soul are missing or fragmented... I watched 9S fall apart in route [C/D], as he learned that every meaning his life had ever had was either dead, or a lie; I wanted to hug him. I wanted to hold him and tell him that it would all be alright, but I couldn't.

Even if I could tell him, I couldn't, because it isn't all okay. Suffering is real, and often so much easier to find than happiness in this world. Their gods, the humans YoRHa was created to serve, are gone; worse than that, they were even there in the first place.

Every stable foundation they'd built themselves, their identities, upon possessed little more than an illusion of stability and meaning. They'd forced the androids to live in service to a lie.

How do you have hope without purpose? How do you create a purpose for yourself? How do you give anything meaning, and what even is meaning or purpose? To even speculate seems pointless.

I've seen NieR:Automata's path of existential despair with my own two eyes, and I can't think of a single game which expresses that melancholy better.

When 2B or 9S wonders about humanity, or their own sense of meaning, I felt pangs of guilt. It was as if they were begging for me to help them escape their despair, but I could do nothing.

I distinctly remember thinking near the end of the game ""Please, don't ask me these questions. I don't know. I can't help you; I'm sorry."" It hurt because it felt like the characters were turning to me for questions I also had no answers to, and I couldn't help but feel that I was letting them down.

I'm sure there are a million other things I could talk about, but I can hardly get these thoughts out into the world, let alone all the others.",GirlGamers
What is the worst trend in current video games?,"Personally, I am starting to dislike open world games. (Don't @ me XP)

For example, I love Assassin's Creed games. **LOVE.** But Origins left me a little bit unfulfilled. It seemed like the main story became a second thought because of all of the side quests, encounters, whatever that need to be scattered throughout the world. It becomes repetitive.

Would you be pumped on a new gamer bar? I need advice!!,"Hey ladies, my name is Maggie. I am an entrepreneur living in San Jose California - **working on a project to open up an eSports bar in the Bay Area.** Will you give me some feedback on the idea?

There is nowhere for nerds to go get their drink on in a comfortable environment. I would literally rather die than step foot in a club. You couldn't pay me to go out dancing. I just want to kick it with some friends, have beers, and whoop some ass at video games. So where do we go? Living rooms. Basements. Garages. etc. I want a spot we can go out and do what we do best, but in a public environment. I am not talking about an eSports arena (because those are cool and all, but sitting in a huge room wearing headphones is not my kind of socializing), and I am not talking about a LAN center, I am talking a gamer bar.

A mix of console, VR, and computer gaming with eSPorts events and twitch streams on the TVs. Each booth with its own TV and access to every multiplayer game you can think of. You can chill and watch, chill and play, or get your competitive juices flowing and take on friends and other people at the bar.

There is a certain energy when a group of gamers get together and take each other on at our favorite games. The idea here is to get our butts out of the house and build a community. eSports are bigger than ever and growing rapidly. Gaming is no longer just for kids. We gotta step out of the shadows and show the world how gamers party! Gaming is cool, fun, competitive, and many peoples favorite hobby. From NES to Oculus Rift and everything in between.

If there was a spot with games, food, and booze - do you think it would succeed in the Bay Area? How do you picture a gamer bar? Would you come check it out?

Thanks everyone!

"""Girl Gamer"" Imposter Syndrome?","Hi all,

So I've been trying to process these feelings for a while, ever since my world view was utterly blown when I realized how a ""girl gamer"" was normally treated by the gaming community. I grew up not really being able to play video games because my parents thought they were terrible (I still hide all my game stuff and tell them it's my BF's when they visit) so I sneakily played DS emulators and interactive fiction at school. All of my friends were girls and a lot of them gamed so I never thought there was anything unusual about girls playing video games. After I got into college, I began to actually play a lot more. It wasn't until a date saw my Steam library and was like ""wow you're actually a *real* gamer"" that I had any idea that ""girl gamers"" were rare. My bf was kinda surprised by my surprise because he pointed out that even though he hung out in the nerdiest circles at our (admittedly tiny) college, I was the only girl he knew that truly was interested in video games because I just *liked* them and not other reasons. 


So with that pointed out, and after seeing how talented all of you lovely ladies here are, I have - I don't know - weird feelings of imposter syndrome? Like I don't deserve the title of ""girl gamer"" somehow? My closest female friend that games is super competitive and into esports and FPS stuff and sometimes gatekeeps ""my"" kind of gaming, like I'm not really a true gamer. 


I don't like FPS's, I just generally don't like combat or violence that much. I love the narratives and stories of games, so I play almost every game on ""story mode"" because I'd much rather be a kleptomaniac and loot every item in game or run around and listen to every piece of lore or reroll my character until she's perfect or craft pretty armor than figure out the combat mechanics. I also like to play with walkthroughs because I obsessively want to experience *everything* in my one run because my backlog is so long and I get bored easily. I have horrible hand-eye coordination so I literally cannot walk and shoot at the same time in games.


All of these habits have been mocked teasingly by my friends. My bf tries to tell me I won't improve at being ""good"" at games until I stop being so afraid of failure and using walkthroughs as a crutch. He helped coach me through Overwatch but I didn't really get that much into the game - I liked the skins and aesthetics of the game but shooting things frustrates me. My friends - a lot of guys - joke about how bad I am at video games too. I've kinda embraced it because I like playing what I play but it still stings a bit sometimes. 

I guess I just feel like a terrible representation of a girl gamer? I feel like I should better represent ""girl gamer"" to everyone I meet/know but I'm scared I'm just perpetuating terrible stereotypes? 

Anyone else feel this way or is it just me?",GirlGamers

Setting up an ARK server! Please give your opinion on maps and game modes!,"Hi everyone! I'm Sharky and I'm a big fan of ARK: Survival Evolved. I was happily surprised to see in a recent post there is a big interest in a Girl Gamers ARK server where we can all play together without worrying about harassment or offensive behaviour. I ran my own ARK server last year for a few months with a few people, but eventually interest dropped off and I shut it down. I am very eager to play again so I am preparing to start it up again, but I need your input!



I created a Discord server specifically for this ARK server, it is private and will only be available to people with a link AKA you lovely people. My goal is to create a safe space for women, femme and non binary people to play together, make friends, and enjoy ARK without the toxicity so common in most servers. I am open to allowing men and masculine people join as well so long as they adhere strictly to our core values of inclusivity, respect, and safety from any form of discrimination. For now, though, I'm limiting join requests to people in this sub so I can keep track of things as we get started, and I am ALWAYS open to suggestions or concerns!



**UPDATED July 4: Here is a 24 hour invite link to the Discord: https://discord.gg/998pKpv**



Please read through the rules and introduce yourself! Before I officially open the server itself, I want to know what game mode and server features the majority of players want to see. I generally play PVE myself due to bad experiences with griefing and harassment, but I am open to PVP if we can coordinate it in a way that isn't detrimental to those who prefer PVE. Please include your preference for PVE or PVP in your introduction!



As well, we need to choose a starting map! The host I have chosen does allow cluster maps so we can travel between ARKs easily, but for starters I'd like to set up just one and get everyone acclimated before adding more. I personally enjoy the Ragnarok map for its size and variety of cool build spots, but again, please state your preference of maps in your intro post. Options include The Island, The Center and Ragnarok.



Finally, any suggestions for mods to install or game adjustments (like tame speed, experience gain rate, etc etc) are appreciated. I generally do increase the tame rate and experience gained to a degree so that the early levels go by a little more quickly, but too much and you lose the challenge (and the fun!), so knowing what you guys prefer will be very helpful to me.



That's about all I have for now! Please feel free to join the Discord server and post your introduction as well as your game preferences and any other suggestions you may have! I will launch the server totally vanilla with tame speed and experience gained rates increased slightly, but everything can be changed once we know what the majority wants. Hope to see you there, friends!

To Transfer Or Not To Transfer... Need advice (after playing God of War for 2 weeks),"I am in need of some advice from my fellow females!

I didn't want to transfer everything anyway, nor did I want to wait that long. 

Obviously, a big mistake to pay for later since it'll wipe everything when I do finally do the transfer.

I can play through God of War completely and then transfer.

I can transfer everything and start over on God of War.

I just randomly remembered the site Steamgifts. Has anyone here ever used it?,"I was pretty active on it back in the day, years ago before the site redesign, and thinking about it just now I've come to realize it was a freaking disaster and that pretty much every interaction I had on there was bad.

For those who don't know what Steamgifts is, it's a website where you can enter giveaways for Steam games.  I know this sounds great and too good to be true, but it is legit.  I won several games on there.  That is the *only* good thing I have to say about the site though.

For whatever reason I used to participate in the forums on there.  Thinking back I don't think I had a single good interaction on there.  Every thread would devolve into arguing, usually racism and sexism, accusing people of being ""leeches"", etc.  It was a mess.

Yes, ""leeches"", that was a big thing on that site.  If you entered giveaways but didn't host any of your own you were branded a leech.  Apparently the concept of gifting actually means nothing to them, and you only deserve to win if you've given stuff back in return.   The number of giveaways you've entered vs. hosted was visible on your profile, so anyone could check your page and then yell at you if they thought your entry to gifting ratio wasn't up to their standard.  It also showed the number of comments you've made on your profile, and if you didn't have more comments than entries people would randomly go off on you for not commenting ""thx"" on literally every single giveaway you entered.

Sexism.  Ohhhh sexism.  My Steam username back then was super feminine and so the name I was stuck with on the site was super feminine and everyone knew I was a girl.  This lead to people either loving me or hating me.  I received many a comment calling me a fake gamer girl (regardless of what I did or said, I was automatically fake just because I'm a girl), or on the opposite end of the spectrum, hitting on me.  

I did win a few games, as I mentioned.  Cheap indie games, nothing super expensive, but free games are free games.

A couple weird, personal anecdotes about the site:

- Some Dutch guy latched onto me and decided to make me admin of a private giveaway group he'd made.  I decided I'd better give away some games to the group and held a bunch of giveaways that only group members could enter.  I gave away like 20 keys.  All the winners received their keys, everything went smoothly, but for some reason Dutch guy randomly decided I scammed/stole the keys somehow and unfriended me and removed me from the group.

- I got a link to a private giveaway for a brand new AAA game once.  My boyfriend really really wanted this game, so I gave him the link for him to join the giveaway.  He won, and was ecstatic.  He streamed the game on Twitch that night.  Well, *apparently* the giveaway was private because the host of the giveaway was really hoping a certain guy would win.  Despite that he gave the link out to quite a few people and about 150 people entered (why he didn't just give the guy the game directly I don't know).  Well, some people got angry that the favorite to win did not win and went to my boyfriend's Steam profile (since winners are public), found his stream, and came into the stream flaming him for entering and winning.  They weren't just mad that he won, they were mad that he entered in the first place, since so and so was supposed to win.  Well if he was supposed to win the the host probably shouldn't have let 150 people enter.

Another funny thing about this site is that I've won and given away quite a few games here on Reddit, across various subreddits, and have never had a problem.  That's really telling when Reddit of all things is leagues better.

I feel seeing that behavior on a site like that with soooo many users is pretty telling about Steam's average userbase.  Lots of toxic, immature guys.

Weird site.  Weird experiences.   Has anyone else ever used it?

P.S.  For those of you just learning about this site and wanting to go there for the prospect of free games, enter giveaways if you want  but for the love of god don't talk to anyone, nothing good can come of it.",GirlGamers

Stardew Valley and moving on from trauma,"(I've told the first part of this story on here before so I'm sorry if you've seen it before)

I've been following Stardew Valley for almost six years now, back since it first appeared on Steam Greenlight in fall of 2012.  I immediately fell in love with it when I saw it.  My favorite game being Terraria, I loved the bright colors, pixel art, and promise of multiplayer.  I also loved that a farming game was coming to PC, because most of them were only on console (Harvest Moon, etc.).  It became one of the first Greenlight games I ever voted for and the one I was most invested in.

I followed the development of the game for years.  I followed the social media, would check for updates regularly.  Over the period of 3.5 years between launching on Greenlight and release I was super invested in and extremely hyped for the game.

When it finally came out in spring of 2016 I bought it right away.  I remember that morning I went to the store and got lunch and snacks and came home prepared for a long day of getting lost in the world of Stardew.  Finally.  After years.  I played all day and had a blast...the wait was worth it.

Then that night something bad happened.  Something extremely traumatic and stressful that left me completely broken and lost for a very very long time.  What was a fun day turned into one of the worst days of my life.

Since I had played Stardew all day that day my mind came to associate the game with the traumatic event.  I couldn't play it at all without having horrible flashbacks to the bad stuff that happened that day, and I'd feel lost and sick to my stomach.  I was unable to play this game that I'd waited so long for.

One thing kept me interested in it though...the promise of multiplayer.  I kept waiting and waiting for that, because I knew if I could play with my boyfriend I could hopefully get to build new, happy memories surrounding the game and move past the bad associations.

When the multiplayer beta was launched a few weeks ago I decided I want to try it.  I was nervous about how I'd react, but determined to give it a shot.

Yesterday I picked him up a copy in the Steam sales and last night we tried playing together.  I was nervous that the bad memories would come back playing but he told me it would be okay and I tried my best to have a good time.

*We had a blast*.  We played all night.  We laughed as I kept accidentally using my watering can everywhere, as he passed out from exhaustion breaking rocks, as I kept gifting townspeople trash.  We goofed off and screwed up and had so much fun along the way.  We're learning together and enjoying each other's company and making wonderful memories to replace the bad ones.

I'm finally getting to play and enjoy this game I've been waiting to play for almost six years now.  I'm finally moving on from the trauma that was preventing me from enjoying this game and making wonderful new memories.  It's really nice.  I'm really happy.

(P.S.  For those who saw my recent post where I was concerned he wouldn't be able to connect to me because of the bad internet where he's temporarily at, it worked fine!  We got Terraria to work too üòÅ)

Overwatch's Endorsements May Be A Game Changer!,"For those that don't follow the game, the Endorsement system dropped in Overwatch proper yesterday. It's a system that lets you commend other players (on your own and the enemy team if you want) for three different kinds of good behavior: good sportsmanship, good teamwork, and shotcalling (leadership). You can't endorse people in your party, or any person more then once a day. The endorsements persist, level, and decay, and people can see what you've been endorsed for in a little pie chart on team screens.

*Ladies*. It was the nicest time I've had in Overwatch, bar none. People were saying hello and being friendly, positive teammates in *quickplay*. My husband, who mostly plays just because I want to play because the toxicity wore him out, was having a blast, and even though I only used my mic a couple of times, I think I could get used to this - people almost *competitively* being nice because of positive reinforcement. I've been sexually harassed enough to be wary about talking in games, and this seems almost like a second chance.

While I think the excitement will die down, I think this has the poatential to have a lasting impact because it scratches a progression itch! What do y'all think? is this something that could work in your favorite game? How was your experience with endorsements, if you play?

I need advice about what to buy,"I just got some dolla dolla bills y‚Äôall and need some advice because I‚Äôm being pulled in a lot of different directions and I have trouble with making decisions. IF YOU DON‚ÄôT WANT TO READ THIS GIANT WALL OF TEXT MAYBE JUST GIVE ME GAME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PLAYSTATION 4. 

Should I buy a mic(because mine broke and I‚Äôve been wanting a replacement :I) and a new game? But if so, what game? Singleplayer, multiplayer? I‚Äôm not good at games so I don‚Äôt really like competitive games because people get mad at me and i have social anxiety so it‚Äôs hard to play with people. But I looooove playing with people at the same time. As for singleplayer I love rpgs. I was thinking about kingdom come deliverance but I‚Äôve heard bad things about the console version. but I don‚Äôt really know about any other rpgs because I‚Äôm burnt out on fallout 4 and skyrim(these two are the main rpgs I know of)  So I guess please give me recommendations. 

Or, a mic and a PSN card(amazon card) so I can play some games I missed on the PS3 like borderlands 1 and 2. Btw, is multiplayer still a thing for borderlands because I don‚Äôt want to play it alone? 

Orrrr a mic and PSN card so I can buy the rest of the dlcs for fallout new Vegas and 3. This is the cheapest option but I‚Äôve been playing New Vegas for the last week or two and I‚Äôm getting burnt out but I really want to play dead money and lonesome road again because they are some of the best dlcs I‚Äôve played in my life. Same goes for the dlcs for 3. But again, getting burnt out on the fallout series and maybe I‚Äôd enjoy another game. 

And the last choice. A mic, PSN card and alcohol so I can get the courage to find people and actually play ESO and FFXIV with. 

Or if you‚Äôve read this giant giant post(thank you btw ‚ò∫Ô∏è) maybe give me a combination of all of the above. ",GirlGamers

[VENTING] Guys who defend sexualization as harmless but then get creepy or gross when faced with it.,"So a game I really like, love in fact, is Path of Exile. One of the initial things that stood out for me was the gender neutral armour. Over time, I realized this wasn't because of an enlightened attitude because the game has the ""globe girls"" (originally two topless, chained slaves on the health and mana displays) which were eventually replaced by skulls but then semi-restored in the form of two of the later antagonists (who are the goddesses of the sun and moon, fighters who wear next to nothing and are overly sexualized). The game also eventually added significant differences in some armour sets turning the female armour sets into ""boob plates"", fortunately this didn't apply retroactively so the simple solution is to stop spending money on the game from now on.

But today, I head over to the PoE sub and find [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8trywa/lunaris_artdeco_style_for_fanart_competition/) and the vile comments within. This is a game with a very toxic community anyway, plus they got very upset when the original globe girls were removed and blamed ""evil SJWs"", they said it was harmless, so on.

Then they behaved like a bunch of 13-year olds when something like this appears, talking about how much they want to have sex with or masturbate over this fictional drawing, people who so much as lament the sexual comments have been attacked and there are the usual ""women should appreciate that men view them like this"", ""this is an attack on heterosexual masculinity"", ""any criticism of my gender as a whole is an attack on me as an individual"" style comments.

I know this is just one drop in a big ocean, but I'm just so tired of it now. How can they honesty defend it as harmless if it is accompanied by such utterly disgusting attitudes towards women?

Does anyone else get Game Fatigue?,"I'm using the term Game Fatigue to refer to a problem I encounter while playing, primarily, stealth and horror games; namely that I can't play them for extended periods of time without my nerves getting frazzled.

Stealth and especially horror games make me anxious and nervous, and they kind of exhaust me mentally. The gameplay tends to be slow and careful, and it always feels like I'm only one or two mistakes from having to start the whole section over.

For example, I've been playing Prey (2017) lately, and while I love the game/setting/story, and the gameplay is good, it also makes me not want to play it. I can't handle how tightly wound it makes me for very long.

When I started out gaming being able to play as female characters was a big deal in a hobby usually seen as aimed at guys (probs why JRPGs and adventure games were so appealing to me, now that I think about it). I love the cast dynamic in jrpgs and the usual decent amount of playable female characters is a bonus (minus some terrible character designs in a few games).

Looking for Advice on gameplay style,"So I've been playing video games since I was a little kid, I've never been very good, but I've always had a ton of fun.

Gaming and Socioeconomic Status,"I didn't consider myself as a ""gamer"" until I was in my twenties and I picked up playing games as an attempt to spend more time with my husband. However, I know some would argue this point. I loved playing games on the computer at school when I was a kid, I totally rocked the single game my family owned for N64, I had a lot of fun when my cousin would let me borrow his Game Boy to play Pok√©mon, I mastered Windows Pinball in middle school and Bejeweled in high school, and I loved pretty much any Sim game I could get my hands on.

The thing is, my family never had very much money growing up. We could only afford 1 game for the N64 (though we would occasionally rent others from Blockbuster) and we eventually had to get rid of the N64 and couldn't afford to buy any consoles after that. We did have a home PC once I started to enter my pre-teens, but it was a pretty old one that couldn't run most newer (at the time) games. Sometimes I wonder if my hobbies or interests when I was growing up would have been different if we could.

It still feels weird at times when friends reminisce about their childhoods playing a specific console or game, as if it was a universal experience for our generation, and I think to myself without saying, ""we couldn't afford that.""

I think this tide is changing. Mobile games are becoming more and more popular and similar in quality to console/PC games and the price of smartphones continues to drop. Plus, nowadays someone can use a cheap laptop to play a lot of ""older"" games that people still rave about like Dragon Age, Skyrim, etc. I'm interested in hearing other views on the topic, though. Did this impact anyone else growing up? Does it still impact you today? What sort of impact do you think it will have on the next generation of gamers?",GirlGamers

Experiences with Animosity from other Female Gamers,"So this is bit of a random topic, but maybe I wanted to examine the psychology of this dynamic. My title should be a bit more specific. So I normally play games and I integrate with a lot of males, and I find it fine for the most part - some minor problems, but nothing too big. But then when there's like another female that gets introduced in the pack -- I often feel like there's some animosity.

I have never really had the opportunity to play with a more female dominant group - so I would imagine this wouldn't be the case. Or of course it could just be unlucky of me to meet with individuals that are just like that in nature. 
My thought was that maybe the women just like to be the alpha in the pack, and they have to exert dominance in the group, some have been younger than me, but some have been older than me. 
I have tried reaching out to some of these females to play together, but I don't gage a lot of interest. Of course there may be other females who just don't like the company other females too. 
So I was kind of curious if anyone had a similar experience, or different ones -- and why do you think these experiences came about?",GirlGamers

Sea of Thieves Discrimination Rant,"Does anyone play Sea of Thieves? It's been my favorite game lately, but my friend I play with currently can't play so I've been joining others from LFG posts. Well, I had a super terrible experience today.

I met this guy last night during a fort. He was pirate legend and seemed like a nice person to play with. He added me, so I accepted. He invited me to his game today. We were doing a legend voyage which generally takes anywhere from 2-4 hours. It was a ship full of all guys. I sailed with them for a the first few maps and everything was okay. They were fighting skeleton captains and told me to go get chickens and pigs, so I thought okay sure. I know that aspect of the voyage is boring so I didnt mind helping out. Well we move on to other voyages and do another fort. During this they tell me to keep look out. So I do. I ask a few times if I could help dig chests etc. and they're like no, you'll just die and make it harder for everyone. That kind of hurt, but I'm over an hour into the mission and want to tough it out. 

Things get worse. They begin to sexualize me and everything I begin to do to try and help is wrong, and they tell me to stop. I tell them I have to step away for a moment but keep my headset on. They think I'm gone and I hear them talking about me. They said ""this is why I hate sailing with girls. They just stand around and act pretty and expect us guys to carry them. Its pathetic""  at this point I begin crying and mute my mic, using only the radial text chat. I tried to help but they wouldn't let me. 

We finally reach the last map. Its been about an hour of sailing silent and being told I don't do anything. Someone goes to dig the last treasure and they're like ""get off here, cactus, and help him fight skeletons so you'll be doing something for once and we can pretend like you earned this treasure."" I stayed silent but helped and they're like ""oohhh you hurt her feelings"" and laughed. 

I stayed silent until we reached the outpost, where I attempted to grab the most valuable items to turn in first because thats what I always do to be safe. They say ""stop digging around and just turn stuff in, whore""

After turning in, I immediately got off, blocked everyone, and cried. I really wanted to leave earlier, but did not want to waste my time that I'd already spent. 

Really, I just needed to vent. If you read it all, thank you. I know I should have stood up for myself more, but I'm just a shy, timid girl who hates confrontation. I'm over it now, as they're just words and not people I really know so no need to let them have that affect on me, but in the moment and right after it was hard.

"This is gonna be an odd question, but - Recommendations for games that do not require opposable thumbs?","So in a few days, I'm going to have splints that I have to wear for like 2 months that immobilize my wrists and thumb (damaged ligaments in my wrists). 

Thing is, I'm a gamer *and* ADHD. I can't turn off my brain very easily, so two months of not using my hands is going to drive me batty. Usually I'm doing at least two things at once (playing games and watching TV, or art and TV, etc). Forced idleness does not suit me. I've already cut significantly down on my gaming because I also have tendonitis in my forearms, so holding a controller or playing games on PC causes me pain after about an hour too. I'm going to try going for more walks, but unfortunately we're also in a big heat wave where I am, and being outside is uncomfortable at best.

So I was looking for suggestions. I've already got Crypt of the Necrodancer (and the dancepad) so I can play that, but one can only do rouge-like dancing for so long. (Thank god for AC though!) I have VR, but I won't be able to use the controllers once I have the splints on. 

So I'm pleading with the community here! And suggestions for games? I have practically every console except for an Xbone, so that's not an issue. 

Last time I had a similar forced idleness like this, we set up emulators so I could play SNES or GB games with a dance pad, and it worked, except it's VERY tedious, and standing to play games for more than an hour or two is tiring.

TL;DR - Gonna be an Iguanodon for two month HALP.",GirlGamers

"Are you comfortable with ""showcasing"" your sex in your gamertag?","This can just apply to anything almost, but anything where you generate a user name or character name, and have everyone see it when you are playing.

I only came to the realization, that I feel sometimes regret, and other times I feel pride too, about having words in my gamer tag that implicate I'm a girl. 

I feel regret when I have to deal with harrassment/sexist remarks from other male gamers, or when I even have some of them wanting to become ""friends"" with me just to be flirty. I want to make friends, but not because I'm a girl -- because of the person I am.

At the same time, I am proud to be a female gamer, especially in some games that are largely dominated by a male population. I feel like I can have the skills to compete with other people on an equal level. I don't want other girls to feel afraid, or uncomfortable playing because of their sex. I want them to know they are not alone because ....guess what? Female gamers are actually a thing in this modern age.

So what do you think? Feel free to share your experiences as well.

"Why Are There Not Many ""Girl"" Games?","I know that games are gender less, but I guess what I mean are your typical cute game with bright colors and fluffy creatures and such.

I've been playing games all my life, but when I was a kid I tried to pretend to like the more ""boyish"" games either to be cool or fit in. As I've gotten older I've realized I'm actually very girly. In my free time I like playing cute, relaxing, and happy games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. I have terrible anxiety and depression and I use these games to help me cope with my problems. I can no longer play competitive games because they cause me stress. I love to play co-op games with friends where we kill zombies or something, as long as it isn't competitive against other players.

I noticed that there don't seem to be a lot of options for games like that. Most of the games that I see are post-apocalyptic games with dark stories. I was very disappointed with E3 because the majority of games being announced seemed to fit in that category. I feel like in the past there used to be a lot more cutesy games being released compared to now.

Am I missing games or something? I would really like to find more cute and relaxing games to play if they're out there!",GirlGamers

Anyone Have Game Recommendations?,"Finally got a laptop so I'm looking for some games to play. It's good but not beefy enough to play games like Ark or Dark Souls 3. Does anyone have games they would recommend?  Love Bioware (Especially Kotor and Mass Effect) and the Zelda franchise, also really enjoyed portal, Mario Odyssey, Stardew Valley and some more that I can't think of now. Considering playing the new Elder Scrolls game when it releases as I haven't played one before and maybe Destiny. 

I'm not hugely picky on the type of game, all I know is I tend to prefer rpg style but am open to try new things. I'm also in my late teens so not super young but young enough that I'd rather not play games with copious gore and sexual content. It gets pretty awkward. Maybe something with skippable cutscenes at least. Love a good story but if the gameplay is good I don't mind super much.

Let me know what you all think, I've been searching around the Internet for a while but never seem to find anything that I'm super into or that doesn't have a huge downside.",GirlGamers

Trying WoW again...,"Hi ladies! I've been in this group for a few months now and I just want to say first how thankful I am for this wonderful community where female gamers can connect and encourage and support one another! As many others have said, it truly is a breath of fresh air in the world of gaming.

I'm trying WoW again after quitting in WoD. My hubby and I quit partly because getting flying was such a grind and also because of the toxic community. I found a group that was doing a transmog contest for 25 beta keys and I actually won one (random drawing). The beta is completely separate from the live game. I was hoping to find some other friends with beta access to play with. 

Does anyone here want a friend to play beta with? I don't enjoy playing a game like WoW that is intended as a massively multiplayer game alone, but when I reach out to look for friends I inevitably find trolls. If this bothers me, should I just quit WoW permanently and avoid MMOs altogether? I do enjoy playing Minecraft with my small group of mature and respectful female friends and wish I could find a such friends in other games like WoW.",GirlGamers

Book Recommendations??,"Hey y‚Äôall,

I was wondering if anyone had any book recommendations on gaming, women in gaming, really anything related to what generally goes on in this subreddit. 

I‚Äôve found a few I‚Äôm interested in, but I‚Äôm really not looking for something intensely academic (I did my time researching games in academia), so that narrows the list down a bit. The ones I‚Äôve found also appear to be quite old, though I‚Äôm interested nonetheless.

I‚Äôm also not just interested in video games. My initial search was actually for books on D&amp;D and it‚Äôs history or players‚Äô experiences and the like. I‚Äôm thinking of reading *Of Dice and Men* on that subject, though I‚Äôve decided against *Confessions of a Part-Time Sorceress* after reading reviews and an excerpt.

I thought this would be the perfect place to ask if anyone had any recommendations for this kind of thing. I read a ton, and I‚Äôd love to be reading about this topic if I can get my hands on some quality books on the subject. I thought others might also be interested.",GirlGamers
