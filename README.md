# webscraping_and_APIs
This is a repository for all of my notebooks that I've used to gather data via webscraping or API's.  While there is likely a copy of each notebook in their respective repositories many of those projects have been shelved for various reasons and I'd like to have one place for all of my webscraping code, API code &amp; data.
