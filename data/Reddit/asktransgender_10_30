I'm about to be homeless and alone. 28F,"Hi I'm Lilliun 28F I'm going through a pretty tough break up right now, I've lost my family up here and my home, im broke, have no car, no job and no safety net. This is so hard to type..

I live in Washington state and was wondering if anyone might know of any resources. I'm so scared and hurt and I dont know what I'm going to do. It sounds dramatic but scrolling down any trans thread can be a bit terrifying...I don't want to die out here. ",asktransgender
Anyone else hate being lumped into the category ‚Äútrans and gender non-conforming‚Äù?,"I see this a lot, in all sorts of places. One was for a LGBT conference I went to where you put your identity on the application and the question was ‚Äúare you transgender or gender nonconforming?‚Äù Like, they wanted to bring in diverse people, but what if they had been trying to increase the number of trans attendees but instead just brought in a bunch of butch women and fem men?

Or when people talk about the community and they say ‚Äútrans and GNC people‚Äù as though we are all in the same category and have the same experiences, when we clearly don‚Äôt. 

This really pisses me off, because I am GNC, but that is not relevant to whether or not I am transgender. I personally would apply GNC to butch women, or to femme guys who wear makeup, and I hate putting the two categories together because it feels like they are saying that me being trans is just being super nonconforming to my assigned gender, as though I am just a super masculine women who defies female gender stereotypes. In reality I‚Äôm a trans guy who is also very feminine. 

It feels like they‚Äôre saying my gender is just my personality or expression, when they‚Äôre completely unrelated. ",asktransgender
My mum just deadnamed me three times over on purpose,"I have updated my name legally and getting everyone to gender me correctly and call me the right name has been an uphill battle. Whenever my mum gets annoyed, she calls me by my old name without meaning to. I picked her up on it tonight (as I do everytime) and because she was angry, she looked at me and repeated my old name three times over. It was really hurtful and I don't know when it is going to click with my family. I've been transitioning for 3 years in January. For my mum to use my deadname to insult me cause she's angry is the most evil thing and I'm really deeply upset. Admittedly I insulted her back in my own way and when I was leaving the room in tears I heard her misgender me to my father (who wasn't responding much) ""did you hear what he said?""

I have no clue how she thinks she is justified at all. She is normally supportive and loving but when she gets angry it's like she is possessed. Sometimes she threatens to cancel my scheduled SRS coming up (my parents are paying for and I'm paying them back when I graduate). I know it's an empty threat but to even bring my gender issues up and use them against me when she is angry is beyond what I thought she was ever capable of.

I don't have anyone to talk to about this. How do I get her to understand that insulting my gender is out of bounds?",asktransgender
Trans Life Regrets,I think one of my biggest regrets is not being brave enough to come out sooner. When I was in middle school I had finally decided to come out to my parents in a letter. I wrote all I had to say put it in an envelope and left it on the table to be read before I woke up the next day. In the middle of the night I woke up because my parents were giving my younger sister medicine for her nasty cough. As soon as they finished and webt back to bed I lost my nerve I went out to the dining room and removed the letter.  I have still not come out to them to this day. The only person I have come out to is my wonderful fiancee who is still unsure how to feel about all of it. She is overall supportive but obviously desn't know how to feel about it.,asktransgender

"I can't be trans, right?","Before transitioning did you do thru a phase of denial? Like I can't possibly be trans, I identify as lesbian. (AFAB) Or, no way, all the work involved! Or (a bad one for me) I don't like men at ALL! I can't be one! 

I've been seeing more and more little signs, and today was a big one. I was scowling, happened to be standing in front of my mirror topless, hands up to brush my hair. And I saw my stupid mustache that no matter how much I pluck it, it keeps coming back. And I saw my hairy pits that I hate shaving. (I cried the last time I shaved them to go swimming). And I paused. For a second I ducked lower, so I could see my pits, and my mustache, and my Resting Bitch Face, but not my boobs. And it just felt. . . good? Then I got back to getting dressed, put my bra on, and tried the mirror again. Seeing the top of my bra, and my straps, made me cry. And now I don't wanna look at a mirror at all. 

But no, not me. I can't be trans. Just. . . Fuck, my brain is so garbled and I can't find words. What if I lose all my friends? I mean, what if I change so much we don't click anymore? I don't know how to be a guy. All the male role models in my life have been scum, I'm not one of those! Would my female best friend still be able to hold me while I cry? How would her husband feel about that? 

Please, no gendered pronouns, and not they/them. I think I'd respond well to dude or sir, or I dunno, buddy, pal, anything gender neutral-ish. 

I can't be a girl today, but I can't even think about being a boy. So no genders, please. üíì",asktransgender
Is it okay to call myself a lesbian?,"So Im a young transwoman (19). And while I've never had sex, i believe im attracted to solely women. 

It isn't me confusing admiration or jealousy for attraction, I legit think i like women. I want to cuddle with other girls, to be intimate.

The idea of doing that with a guy is not enticing in the slightest, and male genitals are kind of scary.

So, it would make sense to label myself as a lesbian. But do i have that right? I pass and live as a woman every day but is sex and relationships where I have to draw the line?

I don't know why i cant just let myself be a lesbian. ",asktransgender
"When you first came out, what were your expectations about the trans experience? In hindsight, how were your expectations challenged?","When I first came out, I was pretty na√Øve. I thought misgendering would happen by accident (and only occasionally), and never on purpose. I assumed the worst that would happen is that someone might need some extra time to understand what being trans means. I never expected so many people to leave, and I never thought I‚Äôd eventually be thankful for it. I thought it would be easy to get on HRT and thought informed consent meant I could just walk into the clinic that day and get them (not that I‚Äôd have to make an appointment and wait forever).

I'm being begged to stop my transition,"I recently told my mother that I have been on HRT for the past six months. She has always told me that I should wait until I'm older to think about it, but now that I've told her what I'm doing she has started to insist that I should stop. She says that I will regret this decision and that she won't be able to handle it. Her belief is that, if anyone from my family or small hometown find out what I'm doing, it will destroy the family. She has begged me to cut all communication to anyone who is transgender or at least supportive because she believes that it's their fault that I'm transgender. Her proposition is for me to stop my transition and wait until I graduate so she can handle it better. I have told her that I can't do that because it would make my dysphoria get out of control and it would be a very long time to wait. I don't want to stop, but I have no idea how to convince her that I'm doing the right thing and that I'm not being selfish.",asktransgender

I came out to my mother,"So, hello. I'm 18 years old, live in a notorious transphobic country you can guess which one and today I decided to come out to my mother who I live with. I finished high school without killing myself successfully while being close to it but now I'm pretty ok.

&amp;#x200B;

And to be honest I couldn't have expected it to go this way.. I think the reaction was pretty good. She accepted it and even said I can continue take my hrt and think together what to do next. It's... awesome! I mean I'm not killed, not homeless and can be open now more..

&amp;#x200B;

Though I don't think she understood me completely.. Of course. She asked why do I need to do this cause I can look like a woman without changing my passport.. And asked me why. She asked me for whom? I said for myself.. she said there are not beautiful people of either sex.. or I can wear long hair or feminine clothes at home, it's all ok. But why do I feel bad in my body? I said for others.. She said why do I care how they see me? I don't honestly know now.. But overall she was accepting. I mean she said it's ok if you want to do it and she won't stop me from doing hrt.. Or changing my sex but generally said maybe I can present as a woman with my old passport and just change a photo? But she is ok even with me changing it but I will need to earn money for it myself cause we are low on it..

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.. I'm pretty confused now.. Mixed feelings. I mean I'm happy too. Now I have almost nothing to hide. And she won't stop me and will try to understand more. Honestly I expected a completely different reaction than discussing future with her with this fact in mind.. She doesn't mind it. Holy cow. And she will go with me to do bloodwork for me not to be anxious..

gender non-conforming trans women,"My girlfriend\* (genderqueer trans woman) has been on hormones for almost 20 years, but she still does not pass all the time (her and I are both aware of the problems with this concept, but that doesn't make her feel better about her situation...) and feels like she hasn't changed a lot. She is queer and rarely presents in a stereotypically feminine way because that's just not her, but she is still sad about the lack of physical change and about almost always being seen as a man. 

I would love to help and make her feel better about herself and hoped that it would maybe help to introduce her to some really bad ass non-femme /and or non-passing trans women / trans feminine people (preferably 40+ years old).

Can I really blame myself for not transitioning earlier?,"I'm 20, MTF, 16 months HRT.

Every day when I look in the mirror, at my face, I am reminded of what male puberty did to it. I look at my jawline, my brow ridge, etc, and I am reminded of the price I paid by delaying transition until 19. 

When I was 14 and still in the closet, my parents joked with me when we were watching a news piece about a ftm, that if I ever wanted to be a girl they would accept me. 

I think what mainly held me off was the fact I went to a religious school where being gay was very frowned upon, let alone being trans. There is no doubt I would have been extremely bullied. And I feel knowing my parents they probably would'nt have accepted me and instead blamed it on autism or obsession.

It wasn't until I came out at 18 that I realised how drastic puberty was and that HRT couldn't change bone. I very wrongly believed that it was okay to delay in case it was just a phase.

But at the same time it's not like I wasn't warned. 
I was repeatedly told by trans people on Yahoo Answers to see a gender therapist and get on t blockers so I would have a better time than what they were going through. But I never listened, kept delaying and posting the same question ""Am I transgender?"" every month hoping for someone to say I wasn't. And when someone said I wasn't I would repost to hear what I wanted to hear.

I'm not in  total despair rn, I feel like I only need FFS for my life to feel complete and then the rest of my body will match. I have to view it this way because there's nothing I can do about any other aspect of my body. 

But I can't help but blame myself so badly, life would've been so much easier if I had somehow managed to medically transition at 14. I already knew I wanted to be girl by the age of 10. 

I feel like it was my very reckless and deeply-flawed determination to live in denial as something I wasn't to avoid transition altogether rather than accepting that it was always inevitable. That is why I feel I can only blame myself.

crash course on makeup?,"hello! i am a 22y/o trans girl (been on HRT 3 days lol) and i've been practising makeup in anticipation of going full-time. i really enjoy applying it, but to put it bluntly, i end up looking like i'm going as an 80s drag queen for halloween. i am terrible at it. does anyone know of any good guides (ideally aimed at trans women) for those who don't know a great deal about it? thanks in advance!

"i sent myself into a gender crisis, got any advice?","title!



i don‚Äôt know how to explain this, but i‚Äôm going to do my best. apologies for any typos, i‚Äôm typing on my phone and i‚Äôm kinda shaky because of nerves.



i‚Äôve identified as a boy (FtM) for three years now, but i‚Äôm starting to question it. it started with me meeting someone on omegle, as dumb as that sounds. i lied to them about being a girl because i panicked, they said they were a girl and i knew if i said i was a boy they‚Äôd disconnect, but then i didn‚Äôt mind. i didn‚Äôt mind that they assumed i was a lesbian when i mentioned my girlfriend, i didn‚Äôt mind that they thought i was a girl. i didn‚Äôt mind when they asked for my name and i gave them my deadname.



i don‚Äôt know what to do because i struggle with internalized transphobia a lot, and a lot of mental issues from my past relationships, so i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs that or if it‚Äôs me genuinely feeling this.



my first girlfriend, she broke up with me because i came out as trans and i told her it bothered me when she talked to me about girls she found attractive. before this, before i broke down, i had lied and said i was genderfluid for months so she could still call me her girlfriend. this experience, me having to lie about my gender to get someone to stay with me, has since left me fucked up in the head and now, i constantly have to ask my girlfriend for reassurance about things like this. i also get the urge to come out as cis, just to get rid of these thoughts.



so i don‚Äôt know if this, if me feeling no annoyance whatsoever at the idea at this person thinking i was a girl, is really something i‚Äôm feeling or if it‚Äôs my head fucking with me.




but i started thinking about it. and i realized it never bothered me too bad, being called a girl, until after i came out. i was homeschooled, very sheltered, didn't have many friends outside of my online friends, so i was basically always called a boy, always referred to as my chosen name, etc. she/her, and just  being called a girl in general only started to bother me when it became something that rarely happened, seeing as i had no social interaction with anyone in real life.


i've got such a vague sense of my gender identity and stuff that i am just so confused and stressed. i don't think going back to she/her, going back to using a feminine name, would bother me but i don't know how to test that without confusing my entire friend group. i'm also very masculine, so i don't think going from one end to the other would be the best for me. i just. don't know what to do. that's why i'm here. i don't have anyone else to talk to about this, and i need advice. 


what should i do? how do you all think i should try to relieve some of this?

Questioning gay man(?) looking for 2nd opinion,"Hi guys, 

I am AMAB that came out as gay when I was 19 after a suicide attempt. I have been living as a gay man for about 4 years and I have had a boyfriend for 1.5 years who I love feeling cute around. I shave my entire body twice a week, I wear nail polish on my toes (not my hands to stay discreet), and I currently have surfer hair that I want to grow to shoulder length or longer. 

I have been browsing the trans subreddits religiously for the past year and have been researching trans issues for the past 2-3 years.

I told my therapist about my gender research about 2 weeks ago. It felt like a really big deal for me to tell her this and I was excited for having done it. However, after I left, I felt like I didn't qualify as being trans. I got this feeling because I started imagining scenarios I wouldn't like about being trans. People's reactions, having to be feminine in *every* circumstance, trading male stereotypes for female stereotypes. 

I think I want to take HRT but I don't think I want to fully transition or call myself trans. I want to be a gay guy with boobs, and typing that out makes me feel really stupid. 

I think I might be non-binary, but I am scared to say that, because I have a lot of internal conflict with the idea of being non-binary. I don't really understand what it means to be non-binary. It kind of feels like a non-statement. Everybody embodies some male and some female characteristics, what's the point in making a distinction? Does a gay man who wears a blouse have to call himself non-binary? In all cases? What's the distinction?

Does it sound like I am just a femme gay man? Am I non-binary? Pls send halp

Facial hair regrowth after electrolysis?,"Hey sisters,

Question for guys and gals about emotion.,"Hi!  I'm 30, MtF and been on hormones for about 10 months now.  Everything is going great with my transition, I feel so much happier about who I am and can actually look at myself in the mirror and see me.

My question is this, for MtF girls have you noticed estrogen making you feel more, for better or worse?  I've spent pretty much my entire adult life alone, with almost no friends and no significant other.  For years this bothered me but not much, and now being on estrogen the pain of loneliness is practically soul crushing, and I've never felt this bad before.

Scared to Start Transitioning FTM,"So... My father, who I still have contact with at this point, is very homophobic and transphobic. Two very big things in my life. I can hide my sexuality just fine, but if I start to transition, that won't be so easy to hide.

All of these friends are a lot further along than I am, either late in transition or have ""completed"" transition already (some a while ago, even). It feels awkward to me, not even on HRT yet and still super baby trans and fragile, to DM them or reach out specifically to ask for time to chat or hang out. Like, that's gotta be super annoying right.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try to find some more friends, nearer to my own situation, to build that kind of friend interaction? I just feel like constantly tapping my older-trans friends on the shoulder to ask if we can grab coffee so they can listen to me barf early-transition feels is... a lot.

So many questions... Though I'd like to ask if my current decided route is smart please.,"Hi everyone! I think I'm MtF? Some hidden doubt, but I'm mostly sure. It's strange... I want to be female, take hormones and such, but I don't really want breasts. Either none or small at best, but I also want to be clearly seen as female with no questions. Anyway! I just turned 21, but more like 15 mentally due to severe isolation and lack of schooling and such. I don't exactly know what I am, but I do know I'm not ""right."" I enjoy being anything but what I actually am, and hate to be called ""he/him."" 

Either way, enough rambling and to the point. Sorry. lol I have a million questions ranging from stupid small stuff that likely everyone knows, to major things probably only professionals can answer. I have absolutely no clue how to go about asking everything though... I guess to start, I'll ask the most important one. Is what my current plan is ideal?

I'm... really broke. I live with my parents who live bill to bill. No money, and I can't function as I am in public to get a job or anything. I'm kinda crippled by the Dysphoria, so I want to desperately rush to be female already. Be called ""her/she,"" and at least be seen as one. But as I am, I just can't do it... I can't just say, I'm female. I don't feel it at all. Nothing will change just switching right now. I truly feel I need more work done first. To me, I think that's voice? Among other things of course, but voice being the upmost important. However I'm an idiot or something, as I just can't make progress on my own. Following guides isn't getting me anywhere, and constantly failing draws dark thoughts in... So I was thinking, I was thinking of selling some stuff and getting voice therapy. Get a few session to help get a feminine voice. I believe, I truly believe that'd be the ticket! Getting my voice down! After getting voice I believe I'll feel ready! Once that happens, I can switch sides and finally start getting my life together. Get out of the darkness.

Though I'm also scared... I'm so very scared. I'm so worried I'm putting my expectations too high or that it won't be enough to make me feel ""ready."" I know I'll likely never feel truly ready, but I just simply can't do it as is. So I guess my question is, is my chosen path at all smart? Am I being stupid?

I know I need real therapy and expert help desperately, but it's not an option for me. I'm on my own. I won't lie, this chosen path might be my last shot. So please, tell me if it's right? Maybe I can do something better with what little funds I have?

Sorry for the wall of text! And if anything was confusing... I tried my best to make sense. I can answer any questions. Anywho! Thanks for reading, and for any help you lovely people give!",asktransgender

does sleeping on your stomach affect breast growth?,hi. i've been on E for 3 months now. i'm a stomach sleeper. i can't sleep in any other position. i have really tried because i'm afraid it might affect breast growth (also it kind of hurts). im just wondering if it would affect growth or if i'm just being too cautious over nothing?,asktransgender
Do you need a therapist for MTF hormones and any advice you could give me as a heads up? Thanks. :),"I posted something similar before. Anyways, I'm having trouble trying to find a local place in Augusta GA to provide the HRT (MTF). I feel like once I start the hormones that it will help in a way. I know I have bad gender dysphoria. 

August is when I had a bad breakup. I devoted myself to becoming a guy full time. I became suicidal. That's when I outsourced and found a few friends that I have now. That's also when they explained it to me that I need to be myself. For 12 years I have wanted to be a girl. I look up to Selena Gomez and many other females and be jealous about not being a female. 
I'm trying to find a place to start the hormones. 

However, my step mom is concerned about me and says that I need a therapist. My insurance sucks and doesn't cover much. Don't even have co pay so affording the blood tests will also be a struggle. However, most of the therapists charge $80 an hour. My step mom is only concerned about me. However, I know hormones effects everyone differently. Do I need a therapist? I wanted to see how it feels to be on the hormones before I start seeing a therapist if I even decide to do so. Issue is I'm very tight on money so I can't just go to a therapist unless I absolutely need it. 

I know I want to be a female. No one can change my mind as I always said I was going to take my secret to the grave and August I almost ended my life. I want to start the hormones, but I don't want to have to drive 2 to 3 hours to take them. I work a 6am to 4:30pm job so I can always take a few hours off, but anything far away will require me taking an entire day off. 

Any advice? Thanks. :) ",asktransgender

Hair removal/feminizing effects without HRT,"Hey friends, bit of an in-depth question:

I've been on estrogen for a couple of years now, and in that time my bipolar-2 has gotten considerably worse. I'm currently doing an experiment where I go off e for two months to see what having testosterone in my system does for my mental health. So far, my depressive episodes are more rare and less intense, and I have slightly increased executive function. I'm already on mood-stabilizers, and they're helping a fair amount, but I'm worried that it would be emotionally healthier in the long run to not be on HRT, which is scary, because I love what estrogen does to me physically.

The thing that gives me the worst dysphoria is facial hair. I had a full round of lasers and a fair amount of electrolysis to get it under control. It wasn't entirely absent, but when I shaved, it was invisible for two days or so. Since this testosterone experiment, it's already grown in thicker. I'll see if going back on E thins it out a bit, but for the moment, and potentially moving forward, I have stubble and shadow again, and people have been consistently misgendering me because of it. My hairline has started re-receding as well.

So my question is: in the event that I can't healthily continue with HRT, what can I do to control my facial hair? If I finish a full expensive program of electrolysis, will that be permanent? I'm unclear on the science of hair growth; does being on T produce new follicles, or just thicken the ones that already exist? Is there a real way to stop my head hair from receding? Maybe even better, is there a way to induce alopecia universalis? What can I do to fix my face without hurting my brain?

Thanks for your help.",asktransgender

Has anyone come out despite no plans to medically transition? Thoughts?,"TL;DR - Is it worth giving up cis privilege if you're not going to medically transition?

I've had a breakthrough in the last few days where I finally feel pretty confident that I'm trans masculine (and NB, but I already knew that). And now that I've finally figured out what I want to look like, I'm realising that it's not actually achievable for me. Long story short, T has effects I definitely don't want, and it won't help with some of things I *do* want, and it's not like I get to pick and choose. So barring major medical advances, my least-bad option is to just focus on what I can do with exercise and styling, and eventually top surgery if I can ever afford it.

I'm not sure I can cope with hiding my gender identity indefinitely though. I need people to understand who I am and what I'm going through. Maybe not everyone I know, but at least those who are important to me. I feel like it's a bit weird to come out though, seeing as my appearance probably won't change all that drastically. Why sign up for all that negativity without even having the benefit of passing?

On the other hand, I want to be authentic, and frankly I hate the idea of being viewed as a butch woman (nothing against butch women, I'm just not one!). And people probably will wonder what's up with the changes I do make, and I'd like to be able to explain. Mostly, I'm just exhausted by hiding.

Anyone else freelance online? I want to use my chosen name but don't know how to do that with contracts and payments and stuff because it's not my legal name.,"Okay a bit of background on me. Due to my home life situation and the school program I am in, I cannot come out at this time so I present female, even though I don't even look female.

Am I a transgender or not?,"Hello! I'm a 28 year old cisgender woman who is truly confused whether I have gender dysphoria or not or whether I am a transgender or not. To start with, I don't actually see myself as a man or think that I am a man but I do want to be one. I always daydream of being a guy and if there were a button that I could press that would turn me into a man, I would press it in a heartbeat. I have had this ""desire"" even before I entered my teenage years; I would often pray to God to turn me into a boy only to end up incredibly sad and disappointed in the morning when my prayer wasn't answered.

I'm currently single right now but I have been in several relationships and I hate seeing photos of myself together with a boyfriend as in my mind there should be two guys in the photo, not a guy and a gal. Also, I'm still into guys and I'm not in anyway attracted to women. Basically, I want to be a gay man. Which I think doesn't make sense. 

I have never told my family about this ""desire"" in a serious manner, but I have jokingly told my dad about it and he only said ""Who doesn't want to be a man?"". I also asked my older sister what she thinks about Chaz Bono (Cher's son), and she thinks ""she's"" been corrupted by the patriarchy into believing that you have to be a man to be able to do traditionally manly stuff, wear manly clothes and that she fell for the lie that manly stuff = good, girly stuff = bad. The only person that knows about this is my best friend who happens to be gay. He thinks that I am nuts to want to be a gay guy because it is so much easier for me to get hot guys as I'm a ""pretty"" woman, according to him.

I have also thought a lot about this ""desire"". Do I really want to be a man or do I only want to be what I think what a man is? Is what I think what a man is only truly based on traditional gender roles? What makes a man a man? One thing I know though is that I want a fully functioning male reproductive system attached to a biological body of a man. I want to be Chris Evans. lol. But then, is biology the only thing that determines whether one is a man or not? If Laverne Cox has been a woman even before she transitioned, then that means biology isn't the only factor, right?

Now regarding transition, I don't think that it is something that I could ever go through as there is no procedure that could truly give me a fully functioning male body. BTW, I have no intention of being discriminatory against anyone by saying ""fully functioning male body"". Right now, I'm just almost always sad, I don't want to say I'm depressed as I have not been diagnosed of it, because I could never be what I want to be. I hate looking at myself in the mirror and seeing a woman there. The only thing that somehow gets me through and cheers me up a bit, though it may sound extremely vain and truly pathetic, are the compliments I get about how pretty I am. It somehow reassures me that I don't have it so bad, that being a woman is who I am meant to be and that trying to be a man would just mess things up.

I am done with waiting,"Last night I went to my schools drag show. It was incredible, I had not realized how much I needed this.

After the show, I got up the courage to say hi, I asked if she had modeled for a Sephora class, she had, and I got to thank her, and she remembered me! Lol I mean I was the only trans man in the class but honestly I was just so happy to be able to thank her and tell her that the night of the class I was able to cut my hair and start making changes.

It was during the class that I realized that if I wanted to survive as a trans man in grad school then I needed to be known as a man. I couldn‚Äôt go back to being Amanda after Aiden felt so good. I couldn‚Äôt stand having strangers call me, she any more. I wanted to be Aiden.

Is it common to go through the questioning period of bisexual &amp; enby before finally accepting myself as a transguy?,"I‚Äôm sorry, I realized it‚Äôs a long post after finishing writing lol. But essentially, it‚Äôs the story about my questioning phase and the question is really what the title says anyway.

For as long as I can remember, I knew I‚Äôve always wanted to be born in a male body instead. It‚Äôs not until I‚Äôm around 19 that I discovered trans people exists and that I can relate myself a lot to them. 

Then, goes a period of time where I constantly keep accepting and denying back and forth that ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm a transguy. no, I‚Äôm just a girl that likes several masculine characteristics and likes being a tomboy‚Äù. I acknowledge that I do like some feminine stuff and act girly sometimes.

So to make sense to myself, I started identifying myself as non-binary and I‚Äôve concluded for a while that I‚Äôm bisexual because I‚Äôve always been attracted to women and men. Life went pretty normal from there.

Now that I‚Äôm almost 24 yo, I started to have social dysphoria again, probably because I‚Äôm now thinking more and more about my near future, like my adult life: career, marriage, family, etc. I think it‚Äôs getting harder and harder for me to live as a female and be treated as one as well as I grow older. 

Also, my body dysphoria has never been more intense than ever. I don‚Äôt hate my body to the point that I‚Äôd want to do harm to myself but I dislike the feminine features more and more. I envy more and more to be a guy and be in a male body. Before when I discovered I may be trans, the idea of taking HRT didn‚Äôt appeal to me. Now, I‚Äôm really considering it. I‚Äôve never dated someone before but I would feel uncomfortable to date anyone in my current body.

I‚Äôm still not sure about this but I also believe that I‚Äôm actually straight and not bi. I start to realize that I‚Äôm attracted to male because I envy to have their body. I have thoughts of getting into dating relationships with guys before but for any serious or sexual relationships, I‚Äôll start feeling uneasy. I don‚Äôt feel like that with girls.

Anyway, I‚Äôm still not out to most of my family and friends yet and I still present myself as a female to my surrounding people. I‚Äôm at the stage of questioning where I‚Äôm pretty certain that I‚Äôm a transman and thinking about medically transitioning which can be a hard process. I also have a bit of concerns whether my thinking will shift again later on, like after I start transitioning and then realizing that it may not be what I want. I‚Äôm afraid of that...My therapist suggests me to explore my male identity further so I can really confirm it because for my entire life, I‚Äôve been suppressing myself a lot and don‚Äôt give enough chance to express myself more masculine.

Just a rant.,"I've been thinking about this more recently, and I'm wondering *would* I really be happier male? I know for a fact if I were born male that I would probably be a more confident, comfortable person. But that's not the case. I'll never be able to be 'biologically male' so what's the point in even trying? And now I'm starting to think that maybe if I were born male I'd want to be female, and I'm confused further. 

I'm not very happy being female, I know that, but how do I know that my discomfort and 'dysphoria' isn't being caused by trauma? Or, perhaps, the dislike of stereotypes? 

A big part of me wishes that I could just be content with a stupid female body, but then another part of me would feel like a huge dick for speaking for transgender people and claiming that I was transgender in the past. I don't want to be a dickhead. But then again I don't want to claim to be something that I'm not. 

My parents always told me not to lie- But they want me to say that I'm a girl. I feel like I'm lying when I say that. When I look at myself in the mirror I don't see a girl. When I look at my face I don't see a girl. I feel like I'm violating women when I use the women's restroom. I feel like a pervert when my female friends undress in front of me, thinking that I'm a girl. Though I don't feel too guilty. They don't know, and I'm not that attracted to women, anyways, so it's not like I would actually have sexual thoughts. 

Every day I feel like life is becoming harder and harder to live. If I were able to just wake up as a boy I feel like living would become easier and maybe even enjoyable. Sure, it would take some getting used to, as I'm usually easily affected by change, but I think I would be much happier.",asktransgender

"Probably a dumb question, but...","Is there a sub where pre-everythings can post a pic, or pics, of themselves and get feedback on how hrt might effect them. I know that this practice seems to be generally frowned upon in subs like r/transpositive and r/transtimelines. 

And yes, I know, ""passing"" shouldn't necessarily be the goal, or the thing your striving for, but as someone who's increasingly considering hrt, and being driven crazy obsessing over their (in my case) masculine features, I feel that a trans positive sub where one could get objective feedback on such things would be great. 

Edit: by feedback I mean simply objective statements regarding appearance. I know that the combination of constant confusion and on and of dysphoria can kinda shift what it is one focusing on at any given time. Like sometimes I'll hyper focus on my chin, then a minute later it'll be my jaw. The shifting about really screws with my mental image of myself, and having an objective 3rd party tell me definitely that I have X and X feature would be helpful.",asktransgender
I had sex for the first time with a guy and it was freaking AWESOME!!!,"Hi, Lena here.

First of all, thanks for all the support from you guys. I am a serious lurker and now I am really excited about this first post.

I am a 18yo M2F girl, now in HRT for around 8 months and I have met an amazing Indian guy from r/sissykik about a month ago and we were kind of cuddling for some weeks ;). He is super charming and funny and he love to sleep on my laps and belly. I am not really comfortable with my transitioning body (even though he loves it) so I was always a bit resistant to get physical. Yesterday we went for a movie and after that we were just chilling at his place, watching one scary movies. Somehow one thing went to another, we end up having a super amazing sex. He was really happy after that, so do I. I tried my level best to make him happy and he did the same. I have never expected that my first sex (as a girl) going to be this great. 

I always want to be a girl since my childhood and I am happy that all my preparations including crossdressing, HRT and workouts finally paid off. ",asktransgender

How to move forward?,"Hi all! First time caller, long time fan... (well, I lurk).

I finally came out to myself like a year ago and thought  'Right... time to get things done M'. I had it all planned out; Get GIC referral (booo UK!), lose the gut (very overweight), lose the fur (seriously... gorilla over here), practice the voice, come out to family and friends, move on with my life.

Then, in ways I'm sure many here are familiar with, life gets in the way. The doubts ('what if its actually just a fetish'), the fear (I'm gonna be the fat freak in the corner with nothing going for her), the shame (seriously wtf), and the complete lack of anything you try seeming to work just piles on top of work and other general life stuff and things get delayed and stalled:

  - I gave up fizzy drinks, I gave up crisps, I gave up sweets, I try fasting but nothing seems to work.. I've lost like an 1/2 an inch in 10 months. I'm still a disgusting blob.

  - I'm so scared of people finding out (there's that shame) that I haven't booked any laser for my fur because when I get close to making that appointment I kind of freak out and stop because as much as I hate it, I can hide behind my hair.

  - I've been growing my head hair out... out being the operative word. No amount of conditioner or brushing/combing seems to stop it being more than a large ball of fluff (its super thick too).

  - I screwed myself up enough to talk to my GP for a referral which got done in July but I haven't heard anything from the GIC.

  - I found a therapist (well, counselor) who seems to work with trans people in my area but cant seem to get a response to my emails (and I'm too scared to do it by phone)

  - Finally, and for those of you who have read down this far, this will not be a surprise, I haven't come out to anyone except my GP and dermatologist (yay psoriasis). I'm just so scared that people will reject me and hate me that I hide away and pretend things are fine (like ive been doing for the last 25 years).

As you can see. I'm kind of a mess. But I still feel I need to do something.. I can barely even look at women walking down the road or online (especially in porn) without wishing I was them.

Well... that turned into more of a rant than I intended but I need some help. Some advice. Some compassion.. I'll take anything at this point. So I've come to you lovely people to get some thoughts from those who know what I am talking about.

Tips on separating childhood biases when trying to be introspective?,"So this is going to be a mess of a post I'm sure.

Fast forward 20 or 30 years and I've moved away from home and have become one of the ""damned liberals"" I heard about growing up. But despite that I still find myself with thoughts that I feel can be traced back to those times. A perfect example is that about a year ago now I finally came out as being bi to a few close friends. It went really well, but since then I've only have one partner that identified as male, it was only a one time thing, and the entire time I had a voice in my head saying I was bad.

Is it hard to find a partner that is non-transgender?,"Hi,

In my journey to better understand Transgender and the LGBTQ community. I wanted to know something..

Is it difficult to find a partner that is non trans? Does any MtF ladies found a man (or woman) that is non trans that accepts them?

Anyone married to anyone like that or have a similar situation? 

You have to forgive my lack of knowledge even though I'm an incredibly intelligent man.

When we were raised it was rooted in us that gays are bad and they deserved to be hanged and beaten and anyone different like trans. I believed this for a very long time and my feelings interwined this way because my trusting adults, figures, and role models instilled this into me. My home country is the only country in the South America and Carribbean's where being Gay or committing ""Homosexual Acts"" go severely punished by law or death. They have a savings clause in their rules so this will not be changed.

"I'm giving up. I'm not a girl, and I'm not trans.","This isn't a question. I just need to put my thoughts out there so I can move on. I'm sick of living in this purgatory, stuck somewhere between genders - stuck being unhappy.

So I'm quitting. I'm just going to learn how to cope with being a man, and leave it at that. I am a man, and that's all there is to it. I can wish and dream and fantasize about being someone not so hateful and miserable, but it will never change. I hate myself, I hate who I'm stuck being. Who I am is never going to change, though. All I can do is change the way I feel about it. I think enabling this fantasy that maybe I'm trans is just making it worse. Now I hate that I'm not female and I'm miserable that I don't have the ability to transition.

I have so much respect for my brothers and sisters out there who are living their truth. It is incredibly empowering and exciting to see everyone post here, /r/transpositve and /r/traa about their journeys and struggles. I'm so proud of everyone who is able to take control and be who they know they are.

The problem is that it's also devastating to me. I'm jealous of your ability to know what you need and actually seek it out. I'm so jealous that you are able to be happy and love yourself. I'm not happy. I have never loved myself. As long as I live with this fantasy that I'll never be happy unless I can be female, I never will be.

I'm a boy. That's just the reality. I'll never be a girl, and putting on some makeup and a dress won't change who I am. I'll only wind up dead this way, and so I have to get out. I'm unsubscribing from the trans subs.

I'm not giving up the battle, though. We all have to keep fighting this fight for respect and acceptance. I'm just going to have to be an ally, because that's all I can do. Maybe I'm a coward.

Need advice about moving to the US,"**TL;DR:** Planning on moving from Berlin, Germany to Boston, New Haven, Chicago, Palo Alto or Toronto. Any personal experience with these cities? How safe/tolerant are they? I‚Äôll be post legal name change, about 1 year on HRT but not stealth.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

I have a question for those of you living or having lived in North America:

I am currently living in Berlin, Germany, just finished my first month of HRT and am in the process of having my gender marker and name changed.

My soon to be wife is currently applying for PhD positions in Boston, New Haven, Chicago, Palo Alto and Toronto. We would move where ever she starts her phd next september, by the time we will be married (as two women), I will legally be a woman and be on hrt for one year. I obviously don‚Äôt know how well i will pass but passing is not a big focus for me and i will not want to be stealth, no matter if i could at some point or not.

Any of you with experience with the cities mentioned above, could you tell me a little about the current climate? how is it to live as a visibly trans person in any of these cities? I have been very lucky so far, berlin is extremely tolerant when it comes to LGBTQI\* issues, coming out to my friends, my work place and all other social circles has gone very well, i have experienced nothing but acceptance and support, i feel safe walking around in the city presenting as myself (fulltime for the last 7 months, not even close to passing) etc. no matter where i am, i have only used the woman‚Äôs toilet for half a year and have never even had an uncomfortable situation (this is as close as i have gotten: random cis woman: ‚Äúthis is the ladies room‚Äù me: ‚Äúi know‚Äù them: ‚Äúoh, ok, sorry‚Äù).

Hearing all the horror stories of folks being harassed on the street or in public toilets, of violence against trans people etc. worries me, especially since i grew up in a context where discrimination and harassment against both queer people and women in general seems to be much less prevalent than in the US. While the PhD positions are going to be the main factor in deciding where to move, we obviously won‚Äôt move anywhere where i would not be safe (as safe as any woman would be, living in a big city).

Reading all the news lately has obviously not helped with my anxiety about moving to NA.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post, I would very much appreciate any input you have.

Have a wonderful day,

I'm desperate... Will things ever get better?,"So‚Ä¶ I started HRT at 17 in January 2018, but it took 8-9 months before my dosage was high enough to put me in the female range *(141 pg/mL on 150 mcg patches).* I‚Äôm 18 now, 10 months in, and all I have to show for it is my disillusionment.

&amp;nbsp;

If I‚Äôve learned anything about HRT/transition, it‚Äôs that unless you‚Äôre like &lt;16, age really doesn‚Äôt matter; it‚Äôs *all* genes. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô tall, broad-shouldered/chested, with no hips or waist, giant hands/feet, a disproportionate/large/manly face, and an overall masculine figure. HRT hasn‚Äôt helped in the slightest; all I am is a guy with gynecomastia. I‚Äôve *never* male-failed; nobody‚Äôs noticed a thing! I‚Äôm genuinely too far gone; no amount of time on HRT will help me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just too masculine; I‚Äôll never look feminine, let alone like a girl‚Ä¶ Deep down, I‚Äôve known nothing would help me, but over time, that small sliver of hope I had turned to disillusionment. I‚Äôm almost certainly going to be permanently closeted. 



I‚Äôm only out to my parents and a half-dozen doctors. The former *(who I live with)* aren‚Äôt the least bit supportive, even after a year; my mother has made everything about herself and what *she* wants. She‚Äôs seen me bawling my eyes out countless times, but hasn‚Äôt changed any of her hurtful behaviors *(I won‚Äôt go into details; it‚Äôs too long and frustrating).* I‚Äôve given her PFLAG resources to help her understand, but she didn‚Äôt take any initiative; she just moves the goalposts. As for my father‚Ä¶ well, at least he‚Äôs honest; he doesn‚Äôt pretend to care.



The only girly things I have are a small handful of skincare products; I don‚Äôt have anything in the way of clothes, accessories, makeup, etc. The things I have don‚Äôt even make me feel that much better, only *‚Äônot worse‚Äô.* My dysphoria is intense and it rarely lets up. I have severe anxiety/social anxiety, and probably dysthymia. Everything takes energy which I don‚Äôt have, and I‚Äôm in the process of withdrawing from university to take a gap year; it‚Äôs just too much right now‚Ä¶ As comforting as the thought of simply‚Ä¶ *‚Äôgiving up‚Äô* and having all the pain disappear is, I promised my friends I‚Äôd never hurt myself. Admittedly, it‚Äôs hard to believe anyone would really care. Even so, I‚Äôm too much of a coward to try‚Ä¶



I can‚Äôt function and I‚Äôm getting desperate; I need to do *something* soon. I can‚Äôt ever transition, but dysphoria is killing me. I can‚Äôt even hurt myself‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I genuinely don‚Äôt think things will *ever* get better; my situation is impossible. Am I wrong? Can things *ever* get better - even for me?

**TL;DR: I‚Äôm lost and hopeless; I can‚Äôt transition but dysphoria is killing me. I can‚Äôt even hurt myself‚Ä¶ Things are only getting worse, and I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ Is it at all possible for things to get better? I genuinely can‚Äôt imagine things ever improving, let alone being happy...***

* Do the staff ppl seem up to date on treating trans ladies well?
* Do they give you room &amp; time to take off &amp; put on make-up in privacy &amp; in front of a mirror with good lighting?
* Is there a one-person bathroom there / nearby?
* Do the bathrooms have decent mirrors?
* The waiting room 
   * is it often crowded?
   * how physically close are you to others?
   * do the seats face each other?
      * If so is there also a part (or just a seat) of the waiting room where people aren't facing you or are actually unlikely to see you?
   * The photos in Google Maps look like the waiting room has windows that let people in the hall see into it. Is that right?
   * Are they good about finding a room you can wait in alone?
      * (Not the same idea as a room for taking off/putting on make-up, though it may actually be the same room)
   * Is there a spot in the hall that's less exposed (an alcove/corner/etc.)? (So that I can hang out there, while my friend stays in the waiting room for me if necessary)

Just officially came out to my S/O last night...now what?,"TLDR: After wall of text

&amp;#x200B;

So I (33 AMaB) have been lurking for 15 years now, here and every other transgender subreddit and forum that I could find. Now I finally have told someone. She (33 F) had already put it together from finding some of my girl clothing and  conversations where she was trying tor get me to tell her and I could only bring my self to half admit it.

I have known for years that she would support me and she does wholeheartedly (we have been together for 8y). The real breakthrough here is that I have finally come to terms with the fact that I have to actually do something about this. I have buried this for 20 years and I can't keep it down for another 40.

I have never come out to anyone before. It's both terrifying and liberating that there is someone that I can actually be open with for the first time in my life, not that we have gotten to deep into it yet. But I am already exited, I spent all day thinking about getting rid of some old boy clothes and dedicating part of my half of the closet to some of my girl clothes! It feels amazing to think about walking into my closet and seeing that, I can't imagine what it will feel like when it is reality, not just in my head.

So now I am faced with needing to figure out what to do next. Who else do I tell and how do I figure out who needs to know? Who deserves to know? Who can handle knowing? Who can I handle knowing? I don't even know how to think about this. And therapy, I know I should start with someone, but how do I open up to someone who is only there because I am paying them to be there. I haven't found anyone in my life so far that I have felt like I could tell the truth about myself to and not just about trans stuff.

Trust has been hard for me in general in my life, I have always been a ""i'm good, working alot, bla bla bla, lets not talk about me"" type of person. I don't tell anyone anything real. I guess (and I am kind of just realizing this right now as I type) that is because I don't have anything real, my entire persona is false. I have spent my whole life creating a persona and now I have to discover myself again like I was a teenager, but I have to do it while holding down a job that I wont be able to keep if I transition (more on that later) as an adult and paying rent...

Anyway It's time for bed, we'll talk more later. Goodnight Reddit. Thank you for being here for me.

TLDR: Trust is hard, how do you tell people the truth? What is the truth when your entire self has been manufactured to bury the truth?

Get prescription for casodex (bicalutemide) ?,"I'm sorry if I'm not exactly in the good subreddit to ask this (I don't browse reddit much, but to be fair I don't know where else I should have posted this), but I'm a 29 french mtf and want to start HRT. I met with 2 endocrinologists the lasts two months, and, well to put it frankly, it wasn't a particularly enjoyable experience. The first one was extremely brutal and left me under the impression that he hated trans people or maybe even people in general. Not going into full details, but he was enough of a jerk for me to want to be treated by another doctor.

The second one wasn't very nice either, but at least wasn't that bad. Thing is, there is a pretty big scandal in France about androcur (cypro), which is apparently relatively bad for your health and could be responsible for creating small tumors in your brain. Needless to say that I'm not particularly thrilled by this possibility (also the possible depression as a side effect, is scaring me a bit). So I asked the doctor if casodex could be an option, which she answered me by a cold and smug ""I don't even know what that is"". I tried to tell her that it is another form of HRT for mtf, with \*seemingly\* less side effects than cypro and spiro (""I don't know what's spiro either"") and she just stopped the discussion abruptly, visibly annoyed that a patient knew something she didn't. And for God's sake, I don't know jack shit except what I read here and there on the web, I was actually expecting her to tell me more about this. Welp long story short, she's just an androcur doctor, like apparently a lot of her colleagues.

So I guess it's a bit of a specific question but do some people know if there are french endocrinologists (in Paris would be great but hey I'll take what I have) who can prescribe casodex instead of androcur ? Thanks",asktransgender
You don't need dysphoria to be trans?,"Hey, I'm a MtF trans woman and I've always had dysphoria and HRT really helps.

I don't really get the dysphoria arguments though. There's one side that says you need dysphoria to be trans and another that says you don't.

On the truscum(hope thats the right term &gt;.&lt;) side though i see a lot of bullying towards people who aren't gender non conforming, like feminine ftm's which is absolutely terrible and toxic behaviour, as gender is not gender expression and bullying people for their personal choices is NOT ok, nor is forcing trans people to conform to traditional gender roles ok

On the other side though i don't see how anyone would like to transition if they didn't have dysphoria. Obviously being trans is NOT trendy, nobody wants to be assaulted, denied rights, harassed, murdered and so on because its ""cool"" and HRT is quite stressful to your body and I don't see how ANYONE would want that without dysphoria.

Some people say that transitioning because you don't hate yourself right now but would be way happier the other gender is an example of not dysphoric trans people but there's an obvious drive to be the other gender and wanting to be more comfortable means something about your gender assigned at birth is making you uncomfortable and therefore dysphoric and i still can't see how anyone without real dysphoria(even if it isn't intense) would want to transition.

Honestly it's confusing.

"I'm not closeted but I'm also not ""out"". How do I out myself without having to spell it out for people?","I'm in the awkward position of being (mostly) passing physically as a woman but my voice outs me 100%. Thing is though, it doesn't out me as being trans to people, they just assume I'm a gay guy who likes dressing androgynous/femininely and simply looking like a girl.  

That's the case with my coworkers, boss, and roommates. None of them know I'm trans, but I don't hold anything back as far as my transition goes. They all just think I'm gay or a femboy or something I guess.  

I've been out to my family for at least a year now (some family members I've been out to for 7 years) and on hormones for 7.5 months now. I don't know my roommates and coworkers well enough to where I feel comfortable telling them I'm transgender and transitioning from male to female. Not because I don't want them to know, but because the actual act of telling them would be strange.  

So yeah, I mean I wear all women's clothing (no skirts or dresses though), I wear makeup, my nails stay painted very femininely, I wear feminine earrings, I look like a girl lol, etc...   

...yet people still call me man, dude, bro, etc. I obviously don't expect them to know and just start referring to me as a girl, I would just think they'd be very suspicious and maybe try to avoid things like calling me the above terms and asking me things like what it was like being the only boy growing up, etc.

I have made several posts here before, but this time is different. While I am still going through flashbacks from the two times I was raped in my first relationship, I am also now going through extra layers of fear I with the appointment of Judge Brett Kavenaugh, a person who has been accused of rape was just trivially investigated in a one week period, fear that Donald Trump and his congressmen will attempt to make it impossible for me to be able to have an F on my driver's license, and the combination of everything that is going on at work and the fact that I just had a very breif one date third relationship, things have not been great. This past week, mutliple times, I found myself crying for hours on end and losing large chunks of time to flashbacks. With how my first, second and now third relationships have gone, it feels like I am being told by everyone that I date that I am nothing more than a blow up doll to be used for whoever wants to use me. I have been having suicidal thoughts for the past week as well and I am starting to make a plan on killing myself. I have not been able to afford any surgeries, and at my job I get called by my given name and missgendered all the time since I work in a call center and my voice is still very deep since due to my rape whenever I start to work my voice for longer than 30 minutes, I begin to feel as though my rape is happening all over again. I cannot afford a name change at this time as it takes all my money as it is to make ends meet. I am living paycheck to paycheck and do not really have that much wiggle room at all to start saving towards surgeries or to buy nice things for myself. I started on the Keto diet back in April and I have lost a lot of weight, but my clothes do not really fit all that well and I have been unable to buy new ones. Despite having a four year degree in computer science, which took me six years and now $40k in debt to get it, I have been unable to get a job that pays above $13/hr. Everyday that I wake up, it seems that there are more and more things that are getting in the way of me completing my transition, be they monitary like the $40k in student loan debt and the almost $5k I still owe in credit cards from earlier in my life, I have no idea how I will be able to ever pay off this debt and start to afford surgeries, hell even a legal name change is out of reach to me right now since I have to pay for it and changing right now means telling all my creditors of my name change and if they should contest it, would probably result in me running out of the court room and finding anything or anyway that I can to kill myself.

Having been referred here by one of the few people with whom I've discussed these issues, I hope y'all can take some of your experience with yourselves and the community to have a look at my particular issues and see if you have any thoughts on what it all might mean:

\-Extending even in a certain capacity well before puberty, pronounced envy of the female body and female clothing  
\-Interest in cross-dressing and having female features (long hair, breasts, vagina, big hips'n'thighs) both for reasons of comfort and sexual arousal, the latter naturally being a big part of what makes me doubt the weight of all this  
\-What I've taken to calling the ""goddess complex"": highly pronounced and deep-seated male guilt; envy of female fertility, menstruation, etc.; the observation and belief, true or not, that socially and emotionally women are the markedly superior sex; an unfortunate tendency to find myself at times unwittingly buying into pseudo-spiritual TERF rhetoric; which has at times manifested itself in literal worship of certain women, an interest in extreme sexually submissive behaviors, and even urges to castrate myself [Gallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli)\-style

I was quite introverted and thought everyone just thought of me as an ugly nerd, because thats the only way I could see myself.

However, after coming out, Ive spoken with some people that knew me pre-transition, and the fact that I was considered pretty conventionally attractive came back a few times.

Its hard for me to internalise this because I just didnt see myself that way at all at the time. I was the weird introverted nerd that nobody really talked to. Definitely not the hottest guy in the year.

I never gave it much thought, because I was still focusing on my identity now as opposed to then. But now that ive been on hrt for two months and my identity is pretty much settled, ive been thinking about it more and more.

Did anyone else find out that they were precieved as much more attractive than they thought pre-transition? Id be curious to know if this is at all common.

How do I get myself out of a mutually abusive relationship,"My spouse and I have been together for 7 years. For the past 5 years, I have been the sole financial support, as they began to suffer from extremely debilitating anxiety. A fear of doctors and of being locked up, kept them from seeking help for years, all the while their health continued to decline. The worse they got, the greater the strain on our relationship.

Last year, I came out as MtF. A few months later, they came out as non-binary, with worse dysphoria than I, by far.

Our family doctor gave me a referral to a gender therapist , with my appointment about 4 months later. My spouse was refused a referral, while also asking invasive questions about our sex life. So we had to get a new doctor. It took us 4 months to find a doctor, but they were overloaded with patients, and the doctor required a number of tests to be done before he'd do the referral, a process that ended up taking 2 months. When we got the referral, it was for 6 months later. Over a year after we first talked to our doctor.

This was extraordinarily demoralizing to my spouse  causing a major boost to their anxiety, which contributed to making their mild OCD suddenly becoming completely debilitating. Shorty after this, things became extremely difficult, and over the past 6 months, they have become incapable of doing almost anything without some amount of help. I now do all of the cooking and cleaning, and they have become increasingly demanding of how I do everything. Any mistakes, misjudgment, or remotely selfish behavior results in yelling, increasing amounts of verbal abuse, and occasionally, violence. They regularly threaten suicide if things don't improve.

For my part, where once I could handle any of my spouse's problems, and helped them work through everything, I've gradually gotten worse and worse. A few months ago, it seemed that part of me gave up. Most of the time I'm home, I'm emotionally absent. Incapable of providing any sort of emotional support. I have no free time anymore, and I'm rarely getting more than 4 hours of sleep every night.

We both want out of this relationship. But we have no family or friend support, and they have no ability to make money. We only this year managed to get them to meet with mental health professionals, but it could be months or years before they qualify for any financial support. They regularly threaten to walk out or kill themselves, and sometimes, I find myself wishing they would. I feel like I can't  leave, because even if they didn't commit suicide, they would be forced into the streets. 

But I don't know how much longer this can go on. I don't know how much longer I can go on.

I'm probably leaving a lot of details out. It took over an hour to find safe moments to write this. I just need some advice.

Tachycardia while on HRT?,"Hai. 23yo M2F here. I live in Ukraine, and we have this mandatory conscription for men, right? So I've been doing medical examinations based on my previous conditions. As far as I remember, I had a ""heart valve prolapse"" (?) like 10 years ago. So they sent me to do an ECG. I was kinda lost looking for the place where it was performed, so I ended up running around to make it in time. When the doc did it, she asked me,  
- Were you running or something?  
- No I wasn't?   
- Well unless you want to serve I'm just not redoing the test.  
- Do I look like I wanna serve?  
- K.  
After finishing all of the tests I was given I finally started HRT (25mg of cyproterone - antiandrogen, and 2mg of estradiol valerate - crystal fucking estrogen / every day in the morning, pills). Jokes on me, the drafting place memed on me, and gave me another hospital to go through regarding my gastritis, as well as to do a heart ultrasound in the same place. Having tied the tachycardia to me running prior I decide to be little bit more hyperactive before the ultrasound, but nowhere near as much, cause running around inside a hospital is odd. So, the guy ultrasounds my heart (20 days after the start of HRT), says,  
- You have tachycardia while rested.  
- Ok?  
- That most likely means your thyroid gland is making more hormones than usual. Lemme ultrasound that to just in case.  
- Ok?  
- Doesn't look deformed. But maybe look into it at some point?  
- Ok.  
So I googled about HRT causing tachycardia, but couldn't find anything. I really don't wanna bring up Transsexualism with the commissary until I get a passport change. I don't feel terribly safe going to a random cardiologist to ""look into it"" cause Ukraine and I'd have to mention HRT. I could probably find out a name of a specific friendly doctor, but they probably won't be in my city.
So, can HRT cause tachycardia? Could the hormone explanation of his just be a coincidence with the fact I was maybe just worried about what he was gonna say?  
Any recommendations on what to do about it if anything?  

Edit: Also unrelated question, is all estradiol taken sublingually or no? From what I can see in the instruction, I should just swallow them like a little slut, but seeing some posts on this subreddit makes me feel like an idiot.

Does hrt get better?,"I'm on my first week of HRT and while I've definitely had some moments of a very child like calm, my anxiety has shot through the roof and Ive been experiencing a lot of depersonalization. Ive always been really scared of being sick and, having gone through a depression, really concerned about my mental health. I can see how the changed in my body might trigger a sense of weirdness that might trigger my anxiety. I havent feel outright depressive or suicidal, but I get these intrusive thoughts that I might fall into a depressive episode or have suicidal ideation and it's really scary.

Also, while I had definitely reached a point of feeling like I had to pursue HRT, I'm only out to my mother and my gf, and its not something that ive integrated to my life. Now that I feel myself abandoning being cis and being a man for good, I feel scared because I havenr found a home in being  trans and occupying a place in femininity.

Help me understand so i can help.,"So recently ive seen a lot of posts on facebook about trumps possible proposed policy to remove the legal term trans. So i posted on it asking for what it does and why it was bad as well as looked over the notes of the policy. So my understanding is your gender will he the sex you were born as. 

Someone explained some issues but out of the issues stated then only one it would effect was that the legal fees you paid to have your gender changed does go to waste. 

While it doesnt effeft me and i dont think it important i understand it means a lot to some people.

They also stated how it remove there rights. But i didnt get this reason. If your legal gender is made male or female then youd have the same rights as a male or female. So wouldnt you then have more rights? I know sadly there are laws that are harmful or dont protect trans. But this would fix that problem. And theyd have laws the have been in place for decades or longer. It wouldnt effect thier medical since if you are born male and transition to being female you cant get pregnant or have periods. And for females that transition to males you dont have a prostate. 

So long question short. How does this negafigely effect the transcommunity besides the fact of legal fees lost and not having yoir current gended reflected on legal documents?

Suporn Clinic payment options,"Hello,

I have a question regarding payment options for suporn clinic.

The situation is is that my insurance provider will pay for the surgery, but only after the surgery. Whist the clinic requires the sum to be paid 30 days in advance.

However in their email to me they specified this:

&gt; *On request, an alternative schedule for payments or payment terms may be made by prior agreement by the Clinic*

Now I wonder whether they would accept a letter from my insurance provider as proof that I can pay.

I've already wrote this letter:

&gt; Dear Sir/Madam,  
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to inquire about the possibility of payment.  
&gt;  
&gt;My situation is is that my healthcare provider will only pay after a surgery has been completed.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I would like to ask whether it's possible for my healthcare provider to provide a letter confirming they will pay the sum by proxy of me.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for the 20% deposit. It forms no issue for me to pay that sum.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this is not possible I do understand  
&gt;  
&gt;With Kind Regards,  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Name\]

There aren't many other alternatives for me to finance this as no bank would give me a loan leaving the only option being a  private loan, but I know of nobody that would give me one.

Feel like I'm stuck in the middle after transitoning,"Hey guys. I kinda need some help regarding my transition. I'm not sure if this is normal and apart of the transition process. 

So I came out as transgender at 13 and started to present more masculine. Once I realized, I didn't have a second thought. I came out pretty quickly. I'm now 19 and have been on testosterone for 2.5 years, since I was 16. I've had my name legally changed for 2.5 years too.

For the past year or so, I've been wishing I could've stayed a girl. I never had this 'guilt' up until recently. I guess it's not guilt, but I wish I could've been 'normal', if you know what I mean. 

I know I have discomfort with my body and want top surgery eventually. There's some days where I wish I could just live as a girl, but just for a day. 

I know it's also odd but I do want to get pregnant one day if I can, and I wish it would be 'normal', like being a pregnant girl is. You don't see pregnant men. 

I guess I kinda feel like I'm stuck in the middle. I envy pretty girls. I was never a good at being a girl. And I do have dysphoria and feel like I'm a man, but I wish I could switch once in a while. 

I don't think I want to detransition, but if I did in the future I wouldn't want to feel the shame of saying ""I was wrong"", and going off T and already having my name legally changed. But I don't feel like I want to.

I know there are short guys, but I'm so tired of being that uncommonly short guy.  

It's just frustrating because I wish so badly I could've just stayed a girl but I had this pull to be male. 

I want to be normal. I don't know what to do. I don't know why this has hit me so late in my transition instead of the beginning. Anyone else feel like this? ",asktransgender

"Questioning (MtF): One thing that still makes me doubt myself is that I still don't see myself growing old as a ""woman"". Anyone experience anything similar when cracking your shell?","I'm questioning my gender and have slowly come to realise over time that I'm probably a trans girl. In the process, there's been a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty and always feel really horrible when I feel uncertain.

One thing that especially bothers me at the moment is that I don't see myself as a ""woman"" or growing old as a woman. I've always considered myself to be male and even trying to see myself as female is a bit difficult especially in boy mode (though I really want to and when I feel feminine, I feel the happiest). If anything, I can definitely see myself as a ""girl"" or ""sister"" (love being called that) but not a ""woman"". Growing up, I always thought I would grow old as a man and have never had many female role models (looked up more to my dad than my mom).

I fit so many of the criteria for gender dysphoria and being a girl has been a longtime dream since I was quite young with so many other things pointing to me being trans. I really want to start hrt but am scared I'll regret it. Is seeing myself as a woman just something that comes with time/coming to accept yourself or am I right to have these doubts? Is it just undoing repression over many years?

If You Pass But Aren't Stealth: How/When Do You Tell People You're Trans?,"For most of my time transitioning (and being a genderfluid person before that) I assumed I didn't pass (though that may not have been true).  But now I find myself in situations where I might, actually, be passing well enough that I need to disclose that I'm transgender, which I've never done before.

This week I had a job interview, the first since I transitioned. It dawned on me only afterwards that I might have passed the entire time. The company in question is reasonably progressive and in San Francisco, but still, I'd feel bad if me being ""out"" caused problems after I was on the job, so I'd prefer to be ""out"" beforehand.

Even more scary, I met someone at a club last night - something I've never done before (Avril Lavigne's girlfriend was playing, and we both basically pointed at each other and pantomimed ""Hey Hey You You I Could Be Your Girlfriend""). We were making out, and wound up going back to her place; her severe intoxication pre-empted the conversation, but how to tell her was almost all I could think about (I'm non-op, too).  Normally I meet girls on dating sites where I'm explicitly transgender, so I never have to have that conversation.

Stuck in a rut- coming out to my girlfriend?,"   Okay, so its a long story so I'll try to start.

   I'm not 100% sure yet, but in the time I've spent sorting through my thoughts (~1 year? Wow time flies) I've become more certain that I'd be happier identifying as female. I just want to see now how it feels to be adressed as such and to dress accordingly in public, rather than just privately.

   I'm quite sure my parents wouldn't mind (they put great effort into understanding and supporting my trans cousin) and I'm not too close with any of my real-life friends, so I'd be cool with waving some/most goodbye if they turn out to be assholes. No big deal, really.

   But then there's my girlfriend.

   We've been together for almost 2 years now and have become what all our friends consider as 'ultimate couple goals'- caring, understanding, supportive, and cute. This girl means the world to me, and I have more respect for her than I have for myself.

   But I'm pretty sure she's straight...

   I know that bringing this up to her would be stressful- not entirely sure how she'd react, but enough that it could cause her grief. Unlike with my friends, I don't want her to feel any of that! She's already got a stressful enough home life, and every time I even consider telling her either something new comes up and I don't want to pile more stress on her or we're finally getting an alone moment and I get to finally see her relaxed and comfortable and how could I ruin that!? 

   So since I'm not completely sure she's straight, I've been trying to think of ways to find out, then I can determine what to do from there. If I just ask her up-front, that'll be obvious that something's up. We enjoy truth or dare, so I could always ask then, but idk if I could conceal my displeasure at her potential response; again, something's obviously up. I've considered asking her best friends (others always know more about each other than I seem to) but oh boy that's gonna be another mess, not to mention I'd have know way of knowing if they really know or are also just assuming based on history. I can't ask her family (pretty sure the dad's transphobic, but no one likes him anyways so idc what he thinks of me).

   And then if I find out for sure, then I gotta confess to her! How could I find a way to make that not dreadful? I'd either ruin a happy couple mood, leave her tense and worried until we can meet, be completely disrespectful by practically breaking up with her over text, or coming out in one of our groups and completely causing a scene!

   As for the stress reduction, while I'm not super bothered by being adressed as a guy, it's becoming tiresome and I hate keeping secrets. I want to be open with the world, and the wait is slowly driving me crazy. I've considered waiting until summer vacation to discuss since no school will mean less stress, but idk if I can wait that long...

   Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I'm so glad I finally got to vent this somewhere. Sorry again for the long post.",asktransgender
Over My Head,"Hello,

I'm new to this forum.  It's quite a pleasure to meet all of you.  

Currently, I'm only on 25 mg of Spironolactone.  I really like the effects because in many ways, I feel significantly less like a man.  

I'm not quite sure if I identify as female or as non-binary, as there's kind of evidence for both I suppose.  Anyhow, I like most of the effects of androgen deprivation, except for the weight problems, cognitive problems, hot flashes, and loss of libido.  

To counter these problems and to see if I like Estrogen, at my upcoming Endocrinologist appointment soon, I was thinking about asking to try a low dose of estrogen.  

Is this a good idea?  Also, on a low dose of estrogen, if my testosterone is down to castrate levels, I know that I'll grow (hopefully small) breasts and my skin will further change, but what about facial feminization?  I'm fearful that I won't look how I want myself to.

There's so much more I want to say about my current situation, but I feel so overwhelmed right now, and I feel like I'm not able to think clearly.  I guess I've always just envied thin and attractive girls who were in lesbian relationships and were treated in a way I wanted to be treated; and they got to do things like play a dating and sex role with women that at least wasn't so easy for me to play as a man.

I feel I've had to wait way too long to go ahead with this, too.  I live in central PA, and I'm sorry for dissing the area, but it's not exactly the most progressive and advanced place in the USA.  I feel like there's way too much red tape.  For instance, I've had therapists tell me to grow my hair long, paint my nails, wear makeup, and wear women's clothes in public before going on hormones, and just to be able to go on hormones people most often need a stupid referral letter.  It's just absurd.  My hair's too thick to grow down right now, it'll feel uncomfortable.  And I don't want to wear makeup or paint my nails; it's too redundant for me.  Also, I think a therapist who advises me to wear women's clothes in public is out of touch with reality.  It's still very much a stigma to do something like that, especially in Central PA.  I'm not going to risk my life and risk being bullied/harassed for the sake of trying to be feminine enough just to be able to simply try female hormones.  ",asktransgender

Partial support from parents (Rant),"So I feel like ranting because of a situation that happened with my mom recently. I‚Äôm 20 currently living with my parents, and I came out as trans(mtf) 3 years ago so I‚Äôve been on hormones for 3 years now. My parents didn‚Äôt disown me or anything when I came out, they understood and everything. Since they only speak Spanish they are respectful enough to not call me by my dead name, but my dad sometimes still calls me Hijo(means son). For some reason Spanish pronouns don‚Äôt tigger me that much mostly because we live in a area where not a lot of people speak Spanish, so people don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre saying. However the people that do speak Spanish here, whenever my parents speak to them they use male pronouns, which I hate because they‚Äôre saying he and son but when they see me and see someone that looks like a female and dresses like a female they get confused. It‚Äôs pisses me off so bad but when I try to correct my mom about it she thinks it‚Äôs disrespectful.

I have spoken to my mom about surgeries and all that and she‚Äôs perfectly fine with that. But it feels like she‚Äôs just going along with it I don‚Äôt think she really wants me to be this way. I could understand if she‚Äôs just getting use to it but it‚Äôs been 3 years now. For anyone who read all this thank you.

Does it ever get better?,"I‚Äôm fifteen, AMAB, and I‚Äôm honestly tired of it all. Since as early as I could speak, I would say things like ‚ÄúI wanna be a dirl‚Äù [sic] (I was a toddler, don‚Äôt judge.) I would wear my mother‚Äôs dresses, do my nails, receive ‚ÄúHello Kitty‚Äù toys for my birthday, and I was happy. My mother would always let me be me; my dad not so much.

When I was 11, I began to fear that I would soon hit puberty. I went to my father, and asked him to talk it over with my mother (I was going through a rough patch with her, so I preferred that he talk to her) and see if I could start HRT or Puberty Blockers. He said that he would talk to her about it, and eventually came back to me and said they decided against it (I later learned that he had never talked to her, and had lied to me). 

The next few years were misery - as soon as I hit puberty, dysphoria hit me like a bullet train. I was afraid to go out in public now that I was developing an Adam‚Äôs apple. My voice was deepening, meaning that my greatest hobby - singing - was also my greatest stressor. As the years went on, I sank deeper into depression, at one point attempting suicide, and more than once drafting suicide notes.

This year, I finally found the strength to confront my parents about their choice relating to puberty blockers and I, and I learned that my mother had know that I was trans all along and had just been waiting for me to make the first move. Finally, a stroke of luck had hit me; within the next six months, I was on HRT.

Among other tests, my doctor ran an x-ray to see what stage of bone growth I was at and, unfortunately, I turned out to have the bone growth of a seventeen-year-old. This means that I would not experience any of the bone changes I would have if I had started at the age of eleven.

I‚Äôm scared. I can barely afford college - my father is in terrible health and I have a bipolar older brother, meaning we spend large sums of money on medical bills, and are inversely unable to put that money into college savings - so I am afraid as to how I‚Äôm ever going to be able to afford all the different costs associated with being trans.

I have few friends what with me being afraid to be seen post-puberty, and this problem was only exacerbated by some of them leaving me when I came out. The only romantic partner I‚Äôve had was a manipulative chaser, who did specific nsfw things without my consent.

I honestly don‚Äôt see a point to life any more. I‚Äôd love to have a husband who loves me and cares for me unconditionally, to be able to give birth to and mother a child, to experience the little things that define womanhood, such as menstruation. As much as I wish for these things, I know that they can‚Äôt happen - straight men simply don‚Äôt love trans women in our current society, and the rest of my wishes are biological impossibilities. I don‚Äôt see an end where I live a happy life within sight, and I don‚Äôt want to live in misery, so my life only seems to have one possible ending.

Now that you know my story, I ask: Does it ever get better? Is anybody out there able to relate to my story and, if so, what changed your life for the better?",asktransgender
"Checks and balances in politics: ways inadequate, clearly broken","When I hear the words ‚Äúchecks and balances‚Äù, it conjures up warm and fuzzy feelings that there are controls to ensure the safety, wellbeing and empowerment of others.. as Montesquieu said (paraphrasing): ‚Äúthe laws should be organized such that no person in a country should be in fear of any other person‚Äù.

However it seems that there are massive holes in this coverage. Permitting policies to be abruptly implemented that would fundamentally permit denying the basic requirements of life (discrimination permitted based on gender or nationality or residence, for basics such as food, housing, education, medical treatment) to entire groups.. be it immigrants, or lgbt, or some other at risk group.   Discrimination, in this context, is at its heart hate. I hate you enough to profit from your weaknesses.

While ever our political and economic systems continue to be based on permitting some person or group of people to profit from a different  person‚Äôs/group of people‚Äôs exposure to risk and hazzards,  all we are doing is fine tuning the levers to say what level of abuse is ‚Äúfair game‚Äù.  And when those levers get turned towards more exploitation permitted, we see the results all around is in what seems like only days (e.g. in Brazil with increase in lgbt attacks, in USA with families being torn apart by ICE) , and they flow on for months and years.  Turning the levers down a little bit towards less abuse, does not address the core issue that the system is postured such that profiting from hazzard is fundamentally okay.

We really need to find ways of effectively communicating that profiting from other people‚Äôs exposure to risk / hazzard is fundamentally unethical and (at least to me it seems to be) the crux of the issue that tears apart our families, suburbs, cities, countries and civil systems. 

Surely we can create democratic, decentralized systems that prohibit exploitation of others vulnerabilities / risks for profit?

I have some questions about dysphoria and questioning ?," **\[TW\] Quick mention of eating disorder.**

Hi, first, sorry for the long post. I have a few question, but each requires that I explain a little my life, feelings and all.  

First, I‚Äôm AFAB, 20 yo, actually questioning my gender.  

I always acted as masculine when I was little, and was lucky that my family raised me in a pretty neutral way. So, until my early teenage years, I was more or less happy with who I was and how I was treated. I felt really disconnected from my body and sense of self, so as far as I can remember I didn‚Äôt felt body dysphoria (tho now I do).  

**Am I the only one who felt disconnected from my body when I was younger (0-14 yo) ?**

&amp;#x200B;

When puberty hit, I started to eat a lot to hide the curves that I was having. I took like +10 Kg a year minimum. When I think about it, I think it was how I coped with dysphoria. Plus, in the summer, I kept myself hidden under a blanket and couldn't bear to wear a swimsuit.

**Am I the only one who started coping with dysphoria with an eating disorder ?**  

&amp;#x200B;

I started questioning for about a year now, first it was watching FtM videos out of curiosity, then really starting to see that this curiosity came from something else. I started to be more connected with my body and myself in general and lately I started to feel social and body dysphoria a lot. I think I always had them but didn‚Äôt really knew what it was and thought I was just not feeling well. I have a lot of discomfort around my chest and hips (my hips are huge:/) and i can‚Äôt bear with being treated and seen as a girl anymore. I might even cut secretly my hair because I can‚Äôt stand having it long anymore (but that would out me for sure). I‚Äôd tried a binder, and since then it‚Äôs difficult to go out without it. I hate bras, like it‚Äôs worse than not wearing anything.  

**Does it sounds like dysphoria to you ?**  

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôve only ever liked people from the point of view of a guy. I literally cannot have romantic and sexual attraction as a girl.  Aside from that, I‚Äôve never had bottom dysphoria (though I would prefer masculine genitals, I don‚Äôt hate or feel discomfort about my female genitals).  

**Is it normal ?**

&amp;#x200B;

I soon will be seeing a therapist (we don‚Äôt have gender therapists here) for all my questioning but thought about talking about it with people who really know this subject.  **Do you think it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm trans ?** I know I‚Äôm the only one who have the answer, but I‚Äôm really confused rn and I really needed to talk to someone while I wait for a therapist appointment.

What would you say to these ideas about gender roles?,"Full disclosure: 24 year-old white cishet male. I've had some trans and queer friends who I care about deeply, but overall have had nothing approaching any experience of oppression.

So I became familiar with gender variance during the years I spent on Tumblr (2012-2016), in which I followed several trans women for a long time. Now I'm sure we all have our own thoughts about how toxic and far gone parts of that community and discourse were in that time, but I saw how people banded together and cared for each other, proclaiming nearly all identities and self-identifications as valid. IMO, that's pretty important in a society that has had no culturally sanctioned roles for gender and sexually variant folks for over a millennia, since the Christianization of pagan Europe. Most of us here probably know that this variance is as old as human kind and that hundreds of cultures have had additional gender roles to accommodate such people - [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/robinmarceline/status/942542605623029762) is the best collection of info on that I've ever seen. But we in Western (post) Christendom have long since had any ancestral vocabulary of alt. genders erased, so from the mid-20th century onward (especially in the last 20 years) we've created them from scratch. And as a result of coming up in an individualistic culture, today's gender and sexually variant Westerners hold self-identification to be paramount. Again, all identities are valid, even if we have to extend the LGBT acronym into an alphabet soup salad or have rigorous debates over whether or not agender is the same thing as non-binary, or whether this person can claim that identity yadayadayada. I'm not a direct part of those discussions but I've seen all of that happen.

So my belief is that if we had a culturally sanctioned ""third"" gender (or more) we wouldn't be having a lot of these discussions. People wouldn't grow up trying to figure out just what kind agender they were, or call themselves nonbinary (defining themselves against something else), they'd just call themselves ""[freerf](https://youtu.be/HeIkk6Yo0s8?t=1095)"" or something. Or (more likely) one or more of the identities we have today will gain enough social inertia to become that category, so that in 500 years the choices will be ""man"", ""woman"" and ""nobi"". Perhaps this process has already begun. If so, a clearer path to becoming more culturally sanctioned would be to help it along rather than advocating the destruction of all genders (which I'm not sure has ever happened in human history; gender's just something we all do on the species level), or some kind of anarchism where we have to remember 300 different categories and multiple pronouns. (That old nounself pronoun debacle from Tumblr. Sheesh. Singular they won that battle a long time ago).

I'm not advocating for some new rigidity to replace the old mind you. Honestly nearly all of the problems that plague trans people would evaporate if we simply recognized man and woman as mutually overlapping categories - something more like yin and yang - that we can freely move between. I just think in creating new structures we should recognize that everything overlaps, and that people can freely move back and forth in a process of self discovery. That's not too much an extension from what I see trans folk doing now.

So I think I get the whole trans thing, as far as anyone who is not trans can ‚Äòget‚Äô it. You were born male but feel like you are actually a woman. Or vice verse. Or any variation thereof. But how does genderfluidity work? Do you go through stages?

Also, genderfree. I was brought up in a culture where there were two genders, male and female. You had intersex people too but they were a minority and...shamefully, were not seen as equal human beings, they were seen more as freaks of nature.

Among other tests, my doctor ran an x-ray to see what stage of bone growth I was at and, unfortunately, I turned out to have the bone growth of a seventeen-year-old. This means that I would not experience any of the bone changes I would have if I had started at the age of eleven.

I‚Äôm scared. I can barely afford college - my father is in terrible health and I have a bipolar older brother, meaning we spend large sums of money on medical bills, and are inversely unable to put that money into college savings - so I am afraid as to how I‚Äôm ever going to be able to afford all the different costs associated with being trans.

I have few friends what with me being afraid to be seen post-puberty, and this problem was only exacerbated by some of them leaving me when I came out. The only romantic partner I‚Äôve had was a manipulative chaser, who did specific nsfw things without my consent.

I honestly don‚Äôt see a point to life any more. I‚Äôd love to have a husband who loves me and cares for me unconditionally, to be able to give birth to and mother a child, to experience the little things that define womanhood, such as menstruation. As much as I wish for these things, I know that they can‚Äôt happen - straight men simply don‚Äôt love trans women in our current society, and the rest of my wishes are biological impossibilities. I don‚Äôt see an end where I live a happy life within sight, and I don‚Äôt want to live in misery, so my life only seems to have one possible ending.

Now that you know my story, I ask: Does it ever get better? Is anybody out there able to relate to my story and, if so, what changed your life for the better?",asktransgender
Addicted to seeking out invalidation.,"Ever since I realized I was trans and even began to accept it about myself, I have used the internet as a tool to put myself down and invalidate myself. I would, and still very frequently do, purposefully try to find the most inflammatory, hateful, ignorant, or downright stupid comments made about trans issues (like in the YouTube comment section, on Reddit, 4chan, etc.). It will, without fail, make me feel shitty, and is a major, major reason why I put off on transitioning and forced myself into the closet for so many years. I justify it initially as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go laugh at the idiots‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel like being angry‚Äù but in actuality I‚Äôve done it enough and know the consequences enough to think that I do it as a means of hurting myself for some reason, as though there is some catharsis there...

The deeper I go, the deeper I want to go and the more I want to take more drastic physical action against myself due to it. It gets to the point where part of me begins to believe that‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is how every person sees transpeople‚Äù. I can feel the danger, like doing this may contribute to me wanting to kill myself or detransition because I would never be able to function in a society like that. I think it is a big cause of a lot of my mental health issues that aren‚Äôt related directly to gender dysphoria and, yet, I keep doing it. It feels like an addiction. Every time I seek out hateful, bigoted people to tell me I‚Äôm wrong/evil/whatever I end up very hurt and emotionally confused, and it only gets worse every time, but I cannot stop. I feel like I need to figure out how to stop it but I‚Äôve tried a lot and can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one to do this, but I need help on how to stop as it seriously is affecting my mental state and making my life more difficult.

P.S. I was tempted to call this ‚Äúdigital self-harm‚Äù but I hesitate to imply that the suffering I cause myself is worse than the physical suffering others can inflict on themselves, plus I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs already a term...",asktransgender

I don't have disgust with my male genital but I certainly have a problem with my problem with my body developing as one. Am I a trans girl?,"Edit: title fix: as one -&gt; as a male

Warning: Despite our country is being LGBT friendly in the recent years, our education never truly recognized this problem, so this post may contained incorrect noun and some bad grammars.

Let's see:

- I have a disgust with my own body, but I never seem to have a problem with my genital at the current moment.

- I feel uncomfortable being a male in some certain instances. But I still throughly like certain male activities such as male's athletic activities...

- I don't really like the way my body is developing at the current moment

- I love dressing female clothes, but at the same time I don't really have any difficulties with male clothes as well, it's just that I don't have a fashionable taste when it comes to male clothes.

- I love role play as female in roleplaying but I have no problem doing the same in a male role 

- I do feel depressed and sad at some points in my life for no reason, I just feel worthless at some points in my life.

- I do want to participate in female activities in some instances(makeup, dressing,...).

- Preference for friends depends on gender: I love making friends with boys and girls equally so yeah, idk, my preference is equal for male and female.

- It's clear that I'm bisexual

So uhh, am I a trans girl? Or am I something else

Will androgen cream make my clit bigger and feel more pleasure?,"Curious if any of you have experience relevant to this!

I'm a 28yo cis-woman with a very small clit. Very low pleasure sensation on my clit, and never had an orgasm.

I'm wondering if I can grow my clit using a topical cream... maybe this would increase the surface area of the glans and give me more access to pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently small clits are associated with anorgasmia, so I wonder if growing mine would help lead to orgasm. [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/pere-estupinya/having-a-smaller-clitoris\_b\_5908452.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/pere-estupinya/having-a-smaller-clitoris_b_5908452.html?fbclid=IwAR08Xq6W76HcDWbakfYYeNZWaTZ_2aluPjx9X3SdYXdbxvgsPlNkhE78IFk)

However I'm hesitant cuz it appears that some of these creams can have bad side effects such as headache or skin rash. And I'd prefer not to develop other masculine traits. Though that's not a huge issue to me. For the past couple years I've been growing some new hairs on my chin and it doesn't really bother me.

&amp;#x200B;

I read a story from a woman who was accidentally exposed to her husband's Androgel cream. Her sex drive went through the roof, and it was bothering her. But to me that sounds really tempting! I would love to have the experience of feeling horny for no reason. Currently, my desire to have sex is very high, but I don't actually get turned on until about 10 minutes into a sexual experience.   


More background info:

My clit is so small it's difficult to find visually, the glans looks like a grain of rice when aroused. If it try to find it with my finger when I'm aroused, I can't find it. I've always had very low sexual pleasure from it. It used to be overly sensitive and hurt whenever it was touched. Now my partner touches it all the time, I've gotten used to it, so the extreme painful sensitivity has gone away. It's still pretty sensitive now, but not as painful and can give me a general feeling of pleasure. I can get kind of a ""general sexual pleasure"" when it's touched, but my clit itself doesn't actually feel good. As a comparison, I like getting my feet licked. When that happens, my body starts getting turned on, AND my actual feet themselves feel pleasure. But if you touch my clit the only effect is that I get turned on. Though, once by accident I got pregnant... during that time, my actual clit itself felt pleasure, it was a miracle I had never experienced before. Then I miscarried after one week, and the sensation went away.

Thank you for any help or feedback!

Was My Boss In The Wrong? Update!,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9rf25n/was_my_boss_in_the_wrong/

Hey everyone, thanks for your help. I took your advice into account and took many of your suggestions when explaining the situation to a coworker of mine that i trust who is an assistant manager. She's going to be having a chat with the management team and talking to them about how to deal with these sorts of situations, so as it stands the issue seems to be on the path to being solved.

I noticed a pretty large amount of people commenting on my last post which kind of ended up in ""roll over and deal with it,"" which rubbed me the wrong way. I live in Canada, and pretty much any policies made regarding gender and illegal down here, and trans rights are quite well protected. Now, maybe its different where some of you are from, but while I understand we have to pick our battles, I think its also worth noting, especially to those who are newly discovering themselves, that these situations can be resolved, in many cases. Every situation is different and has many nuances which will lead you to decide how to make your decisions, but be sure to know your rights.",asktransgender
"Unable to get erections at all, four months?","Hi everyone~    
I just had a quick question that will dive into nsfw stuffs. It isn't a huge deal for me, but is something I got curious today.    

So for the last two months or so I've switched to masturbating with a wand, because touching it was too dysphoric and I would just end up crying. Where as the wand did it's job and I was okay. However.    

I noticed I stopped getting hard while using it, and now I barely get a semi when I orgasm. Which again, is fine 99% of the time, but just got me curious as to why. I probably orgasm 2-4 times a month, so I don't think it's damage or anything, plus my toy doesn't go *that* fast like the Hitachi or something... I just am curious.     

I tried stroking and doing the old way today just to see if maybe that would help, but nope. It felt great but absolutely no actual growth/erection in site.    

Instead of just get *really* wet. After a few minutes it honestly looks like I peed myself sometimes because for some reason when I lost my erections, I became a fountain.

How do you deal with dysphoria???,"Hey everyone, so basically I want to know how you deal with dysphoria? 
I'm dysphoric about:
- my face. I'm afraid I look quite masculine (my boyfriend disagrees, and I love him for this! He said I have many feminine features) but I still have doubts when I see myself in the mirror and I'm afraid I will just look like ""a boy in a dress""
- my height. I'm 182.5cm or 5.97'' and all cis-women I meet are smaller, and I'd kill to be at least 10cm smaller!! There are a few on the streets that are as tall as I am, and from time to time I see women that are taller than me. So this is nice, but I'd love to wear shoes that have a little heel, but it's not possible because I'd be a giant!! :( 
- my voice. I know I can train it, but does it work with every voice? I've been told I have a very deep voice. Can I still sound like a cis-woman with enough practice? What about shouting? I want to be a teacher and, let's be honest here, you all know how students can be at times. I will have to get loud from time to time, and I don't want to sound like Batman! 

Can E change something about this? Can it make my face a bit more feminine and maybe my voice a little bit higher?? This would be amazing! 
Can you maybe give me a few hints how you deal with it??? I try to ignore the doubts but it's not that easy. As soon as I lay down to sleep or see myself in the mirror, they come back. :/

Am I being unreasonable?,"I live with my parents, and came out to them as trans MtF over 6 months ago. They said they would support me and try to understand. Since then, we have spoken about me being trans maybe three or four times. I started HRT 3 and a half months ago, and the past month or so I have started to femme my wardrobe a bit (wearing women's jeans, tshirts, cardigans, etc). Again, even when I've gone out in full women's clothing and am visibly trans, my parents have never said anything. 

A couple of times I've gotten upset because they've said things that were hurtful, eg. 'you will always be our son.' Whenever I get upset, they say I'm too easily offended and that talking to me is 'like walking on eggshells.' They then will blame my HRT for making me upset. Today I was told that they love and miss male me, and they don't like the person I'm turning into. I said that was hurtful, and they claim that it's not, as they are 'merely having a hard time with the changes.'

I personally think I've given them plenty of time to adjust. I have always ended every conversation about trans stuff by saying I'm very happy to answer any questions they might have, but they never ask. I've offered to give them information on gender transition, or even just stuff like documentaries, but they have declined. I even forwarded the details for a trans information night to my mum, who declined because it was 'too far away' (it was about 20 mins away). Am I being unreasonable in expecting my parents to be a bit more accommodating and accepting, or should they be given more time?

There's nothing wrong with us!,"We're trans no matter what. We're male, female, other genders, all, none, fluid and mixed in every possible way. The names and pronouns we identify with ARE our names and pronouns. And we don't need to give anything in return to the cis society if they accept us. We know better who we are. We don't need to be flawless examples and we don't need to fit into their categories or be compatible with their world views. We don't need to be conventionally attractive, fulfill any expectations people have of our genders, we don't need to ""pass"", we don't have to know how to explain our identities or even be fully certain of them. Being cis is not the default and even if you fear you may be wrong, you should not be afraid to assert your best understanding of yourself. And we don't need to prove anything. Some trans people are horrible, yet they're still trans! A female trans murderer or rapist is still female; we have all rights to condemn her and hate her, but there's no point in denying her womanhood. Cis women also happen to be rapists and murderers, but no one doubts in their identity as women.
We are valid and there's nothing wrong about us. It may feel this way because of the omnipresent transphobia we've experienced directly or indirectly. It's their transphobia that's wrong and damaging.",asktransgender

What conversations helped your parents get to where they are now/a better place in terms of acceptance?,"hey everyone, I'm theo, 18, and ftm. I've been out to my parents as transgender since I was 14. In that time, they've come a long way but I want them to be on board with my transition when the time comes for me to start; family's important to me. They really just want me to be happy and don't seem to see that this is what would help. :') 


 I know I can get them to come around, just like they did with my sexuality. They really just want me to be happy, but I can tell that they're also terrified (even if they won't admit it.) I want to get them to start talking about this regularly so it becomes a normalised topic to them, that way it won't be as scary to face. The issue is, I'm not sure how to begin. I don't know what else to try and talk about, or how to get them to attempt to open a peaceful dialogue about it. 


SO my question is: if your parents were once like mine and have changed their ways, what helped or made them see it through your eyes? Was there a turning point or one conversation that made it click? I'm at a loss of how to move forwards, but don't want to stay in place. Ugh :\

The Chromosome argument,"I often hear the opponents of transgenders use the argument that our XY or XX chromosomes can never be altered and therefore we can never be the gender that we think or feel we truly are.  And despite the fact that most of us feel and think with every fiber of our being that this is not our true gender the chromosomes win the argument because DNA is black and white and hardly indisputable. After all, it is something that you can‚Äôt hide from; it is what it is. Zing they got us. We cannot argue with that. On the surface it would seem that we have no other option but to concede to their point.

Nevertheless, I say this should not win the argument on gender. Why should the unseen XX or XY chromosomes in our DNA get the final say about who or what we are? Sure it is the set code that determines our biology and physical characteristics‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know about anyone else‚Äîbut I have zero awareness of what is going on in my DNA and I have zero awareness of what is going on in other peoples DNA unless I put them under the scrutiny scientific testing. But that is not how people relate and interact with one another in society! It‚Äôs not as though you can see that without the help of scientific testing. That is not how people function society in the everyday reality of our lives. People relate to the world with their senses and that is where the debate should stay. Transgenderism is something that is experienced on a societal and very personal metaphysical level; or dare I say, ethereal level. We feel it with every fiber of our being that we were born in the wrong gender. So why do chromosomes get to tell me who I am or who I get to be? It‚Äôs not as though I or anyone else can have a conversation with them. Also many within the faith communities use the same metaphysics to justify their faith in God. So why can we not equally use the same ethereal metaphysical system of thought to express the essence of our true nature that we believe ourselves to be? And why is it morally wrong to outwardly express that nature by transitioning our exterior to match what we truly believe our nature to be? I personally believe that being inauthentic is the bigger social crime.

Compassion for our plight is completely lacking when they have to break us down to our DNA to tell us what‚Äôs what and who we truly are. This issue goes far deeper than what our DNA says about us on paper.   Anyway‚Ä¶Food for thought.",asktransgender

Being gendered correctly IRL only makes me anxious,"Sorry to vent, I'm just. Deeply frustrated.

Whenever I imagined finally being gendered correctly by a total stranger, no asking for my pronouns, no prompting....... I mean, I didn't imagine it as this grand, beautiful event that I would cherish forever or anything, but in my head, the idea of it always felt....... a little freeing. Being gendered correctly by someone who doesn't know I'm trans, without having to ask the person to do it, or without them being prompted to do so by others who Know I'm trans........... I thought I would feel relieved. 

That. Has not been the case. At all.

Because in the extremely rare cases where it's happened, I haven;t been able to feel anything but extreme, overwhelming anxiety. Because I know I don't pass. I *know*. So every instance where I'm gendered correctly by a stranger becomes a waiting game for ""when the other shoe is gonna drop"", so to speak. Usually it's instant, the person sees my face and instantly apologizes for mistaking ""such a beautiful woman"" for a man. But it's almost worse when it never happens. 3 times now a person has called me ""sir"" or something, and not ""corrected"" themselves, but I haven't felt even slightly happy about it, because in my mind I know it's not because I pass, or because they actually see Me. I know they really didn't ""correct"" themselves because they were just awkward, or were hoping I didn't notice the ""sir"". So I can't relax, I can't be happy, I don't feel relieved even a little, I'm only able to feel anxious and paranoid, caught up in what they're really thinking. Which is Not that I'm actually a ""sir"", or a ""he"".

This is probably stupid, but I feel sort of robbed, almost,,, I just wanted....... to feel even a *little* relieved. But I actually feel more frustrated and anxious with each passing day. I'm so tired of being anxious. I just wanted this small little ""victory"".......... but. Gggrhg

Now a lot of people (including my weekly LGBT group and my therapist) have suggested that some one who puts this much effort into finding someone doesn't really care who they turn out to be.

I'm just worried that its such a shock and something so alien to him that he'll take it poorly and I'll wind up in the situation I did with my mom's family (most of them wanting nothing to do with me).

How do I approach this?

Do I just stay closeted with him? (He's in very poor health and has only a few years left at best.)

Do I just come out directly and hope for the best?

Do I come out slowly and just test the water with each step?

I'm just a bit lost and scared about this thing.

I love him and want him to love me for me but I also don't want him to bail on me like my birthmom and her family.",asktransgender
"NSFW I'm having a problem and I need some help. MTF, HRT","So for the last month, it has burned every-time when I pee. I've been on 6mg estradiol and 250 spiro for 2 months now. Before that it was 4 and 100 respectively. The tip of my penis is not red, my urine tests as fine (without antibodies and no STDs). My doc is just as flabbergasted as I am. It feels like a UTI (I've had them before) but I haven't tested positive for one twice now. 

Is this something anyone else has experienced? My doctor just told me to let her know if it gets worse at this point. But it's kind of annoying. Thought I'd turn here for help.

eidt: SUPER NSFW UPDATE, POSSIBLE GENITAL DYSPHORIA TRIGGER:

So, pain got worse throughout the day. Worse than its been all month. Then I got home at 12am and proceeded to find blood in my urine. That was new. Looking down I noticed blood, just blood - not blood and urine - dripping out of my penis. Instantly I hated my genitals more than normal cause fuck this noise! But then I calmed myself down. New experience. Breathe. That means something somethings clearly in bad shape. 

Went to the urgent care this morning (I'm not paying my 100$ copay at the hospital if I didn't have to). Got a doctor who was certainly friendly but new nothing about trans issues (she had a harder time with my hormone pronunciation than I did). She ran more bloodwork, and a urinalysis and checked (with a swab) for a yeast infection. Which no one had done. 

Now to find out if I can take the prescription to fix it with my hormones. She told me to wait to talk to my regular doctor because she had no idea and didn't want me to die. 

Bonus: she ran bloodwork for kidney function, but when I asked if she could do estradiol and testosterone serums she said she'd be happy to. I'll find out my levels tomorrow a whole month til my next check-up. ",asktransgender
How do I even begin to date? I feel sick without intimacy. I'm just dead.,"Background: 21 year old NB, graysexual. Intersex. Only started to have any friends at all recently, never dated. Ugly and obese and a general cloud of negativity no matter how hard I try. Dysphoria has been beyond regular and crippling for as long as I can remember.

I just want to be with somebody who really gets me, but I don't think that's possible. That just makes me want to stop existing. Not die, I just wish I never wasted anybody's time. Intimacy is something I have always needed, but I've held myself back and repressed myself so long that I don't even feel comfortable with my own family. I never got to be a teenager. I haven't lived at all.

I'm amazed that I'm alive now. I was waiting to die until very recently. I let myself become disgusting. I have never felt comfortable in this horrible, disgusting androgynous body. I see so many beautiful androgynous people but I can never be that. I've always been the fat kid boys thought they could grope, even kiss. I have two trans friends, and they are the only thing that makes me happy. Are they even my friends? No, I have none. They just bear with me out of pity.

Why was I even born at all? I'm a talented person, that is something I doubt but people say it so I believe it,  but I have this indescribably miserable life completely preventing me from ever being happy. And why do anything at all, then? I'm the type of person that needs intimacy, and I will never have that. Not interested in sex, just somebody who will be there for me who I can squeeze and just lay with. Somebody with a beautiful head of hair that I can bury my face in.

I've caught the interest of ONE guy ever and I was so completely dissociated I wasn't even my real self. It was online, in a game. If he had heard my disgusting stammering voice he would find me disgusting like everybody else. I was somebody I made up. Maybe that is some part of who I am, but that just isn't enough. I need somebody who makes me feel valued at all, because at this point I am doubting that every single day.

ANY advice, please. ",asktransgender
Like My Username Suggests,"Hi. You won't recognize me, but I'm back with a new account for similar reasons as last time. I am confused about my gender identity. Two years ago, I believed I was trans, and started crossdressing at home, wearing makeup, etc. I say ""believed"" because maybe 3-4 months after starting to really think I was trans, I came to the conclusion that I probably wasn't. A year went bye, and tonight I've identified a weird feeling that I've been having all week. The same feeling I had a year and a half ago. To describe it is difficult, but I'll try my best: I kinda want to be a girl. However, it's more complicated than that. I was looking through Instagram and came across an account that posted cute/cool pictures of girls and I was immediately attracted, but not in the normal ""oh she looks cute, I wonder if I could date her"" kind of way. The one thing I can tell about this feeling is that is distinctly not sexual/romantic. It was more in a ""wow, I want to BE her."" kind of way. However, I'm not sure if this is due to being trans or simply thinking she looked really nice. I also recently have been having vaguely negative feelings towards my own body, and have always have negative feelings for my low voice. However, this could be related to my less-than-great body, and bad singing voice. I'm not making any decisions tonight, because it hasn't really been a problem until today/yesterday. However, I'd like to ask your opinion. In my very young childhood (4-9) I was known to play with dolls and dresses, but nowadays I like to do woodworking/metalworking, but am not adverse to makeup/fashion so the ""do you like stereo girly things?"" question is kinda jury-out. I feel like if I passed 100% as a woman I would like it, but my past crossdressings that look very obviously trans give me serious cringe/dysphoria, and being a guy isn't some terrible thing for me, so I might be non-binary? My overall problem is that I can't identify whether i'm feeling dysphoria or cringe, envy, etc. What do you guys think?",asktransgender
Is it normal to have a paste left over while taking estradiol sublingually?,"I got prescribed 2x 0.5 mg sublingual estradiol, and got [these](https://rxpillimage.nlm.nih.gov/RxImage/image/images/gallery/original/00555-0899-02_NLMIMAGE10_442F2209.jpg) pills from Teva Pharmaceuticals. Even after an hour of holding them under my tongue, though, I still have a lot of white paste floating around, that seems to be little different from the amount I have at 30 minutes or 45 minutes. 

Should I expect there to be filler left over at the end? Is there a way to tell when I've absorbed most of the estrogen and can just swallow the rest?

Yet another 'Am I trans'?,"I'll summarise reasons for/against at the bottom :)

I'm a 17 year old female. I know a lot of this is gender roles, but stick with me!

As a kid, I wasn't super girly (never played with barbies, didn't like pink, instead had tea parties with toy animals).

When I was in year 6 (about 10-11), I started wanting to shop in the boy's section. This lasted about a year or two, then when I got to about year 8, I started wearing girly clothes. I was pretty insecure at this time about fitting in, but I don't think that's  why I stopped the boyish clothes as I don't remember missing them or not wanting to wear girly clothes. I also started questioning my sexuality.

I was depressed for a couple of years around 13/14/15, this got better in year 10, and sort of returned when I went to college as I was away from my friends and feeling lonely again.

In year9/ 10 I started feeling way more girly. I'd always been a huge fan on lana del rey, and I wanted to be like her a lot.

I'm currently 17, and my clothing ranges between very girly (knee high socks, tying ribbons in my hair) to casual (trackies and a jumper). My hairs long and I like it this way. I've never really had male friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My only issue is, that the gender questioning keeps coming up.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is the third time I've questioned my gender, which is very weird for a cis girl I know! The first time was a couple of years ago, and lasted about a week. The second was in April this year, after I suddenly had the thought while tripping on mushrooms. It gave me a lot of anxiety, waking up at 4 in the morning and stuff. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I even dressed up as a boy real quickly and looking in the mirror made me feel nothing.. it didn't feel 'right' or whatever. Weirdly, the best relief I had was to dress up girly. I browsed this forum, but didn't really relate to any of the stories. Then I found some people on the internet talking about TOCD - trans-OCD. I have a history of OCD, and their description matched me better than any genuine trans story. This period lasted a couple of weeks. Both these times, the questioning started when I was watching a lot of RuPaul's Drag Race.

Now, in October, it's back again, although without so much anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

SUMMARY:

Reasons I may be trans:

\-The fact I'm even questioning it. (however, I do have an obsessive mind, and since it's a question that can never truly be answered, it's possible my brain is just clinging to it)

\-I've always been confused about my sexuality. I know I like girls, and feel something towards boys, However, I don't get proper crushes.. more infatuations, even if I don't know them well. This only happens with girls. I wouldn't call myself a lesbian though, but maybe that's just internalised homophobia. I also don't connect with people very well, most people in my college think I'm a bit weird I think, and I feel demisexual. So maybe being trans is the missing piece?

\- As a kid, I remember sometimes playing a boy character in 'poptropica'.

\-Depression at the start of puberty. Wanting to wear boy's clothes, then changing when I got to a new school. I remember my friend saying 'Are you a tomboy?' and denying it strongly. idk what I was so offended about.

\- I remember when I was around 15 thinking it's best to be a girl, then boy, then man, then worst to be a woman. I've always been scared of getting older though.

\-I've always felt 'different'. I know everyone does, though. But I used to google mental illnesses like bipolar/schizophrenia because I thought there must be something wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I'm cis:

\- No dysphoria, even when at my most anxious questioning. In fact, almost the opposite; I feel uncomfortable with how wide my shoulders are, and still am unhappy with how boyish my body is in general (narrow hips/wide waist, flat chest, skinny thighs). Not because I want to be perceived attractive, but just because I'd prefer to have a girlish figure.

\-Being trans just makes no sense?? I'm happy as a girl and always have been, yeah my sexuality is a bit confused and I find it hard to connect to people but I may just be a weird, introverted person? I feel like I'm looking at transness as a magic pill that answers all my lifes problems.

\-Whenever I've fantasied sex, I've been a female (I know the reverse is a common thing with trans people). I've never had fantasies of being a boy - occasionally I've thought 'if i was a boy i'd wear that and look cool', but nothing serious. In my daydreams I'm always a girl - there was one summer, on a road trip, I'd imagine myself being lolita and dancing around.

\-I like being a girl! I've even written in my journal about how lovely female friendship is and stuff.

\-I've connected to female characters in books (I don't remember about male ones), and queer female love stories. Unless I'm actually a straight boy just fetishising them...?

\-I used to think about women doing steroids and I couldn't believe they'd willingly want to inject testosterone! Like it was very alien and weird to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Since being a teenager, I've felt a bit insecure about being masculine, not in how I behave, but my body. I remember constantly looking at my fingers  to see the ratio between index and ring (my rings are longer), as it shows how much testosterone you were exposed to as a fetus. My I feel weird about my chest because it looks like a boy chest with boobs stuck on, because I'm skinny with wide shoulders and small boobs. Sometimes when I'm doing something my brain just goes 'that's a boy hand doing the writing' and I hate it.

If the questioning just went away, I'd be perfectly happy. I've thought about the button test a million times, the answer is I don't know! I imagine if I woke up with a penis and a flat chest and hairy legs etc. and it just feels weird to think about? I don't think I'd hate it, but I don't long for it either. I actually shave my legs a lot, even in winter, cause I like being all soft and smooth.

I think maybe I'm bigender?? Or like Jung's animus - there's a boy I could have been, like a twin. I'm happy being a girl, I just want to know if the questioning will go away. I've read dysphoria never goes away, it comes back stronger each time. But this isn't dysphoria, it's just my brain questioning. Also, it's less strong this third time.

But yeah, this is my story, I'm only posting because I haven't come across one like mine. Thanks so much for reading, I will appreciate anything you have to say!

"Trans people that were raised in conservative households, how long did it take for you to accept yourselves?","I have a moral dilemma every single day. One voice in my head tells me that this is me, and this has been me since early childhood, and that I need to transition to be myself. Another voice tells me that I'm choosing this, that I'm mentally ill, and that I'm justifying all these ""unnatural"" thoughts by ""misconstruing"" my past, and that God made me a man, and I need to accept that. Every time I look at a mirror, one of my inner voice will say how I can't identify with this face or body, and I ask myself how I would look as a woman, and I feel this incongruency between my soul and who I'm looking at in the mirror. Erstwhile, another voice tells me I just have low self esteem and if only I'd be more ""manly"", I'd be ok with how I look, and that if I were to transition, I'd make an ugly woman, and be lonely no matter what. I have these thoughts every single day. I might go to sleep, being content and sure that I was meant to be a woman, only to wake up saying the opposite, and justify it by saying how I'm depressed and only ""pretending"" to be trans to cope with it, and how all the dysphoria I experienced even as a young child was what all guys went through. I grew up very repressed, and still live very repressed in a very conservative household. Sometimes I'll love and accept myself, other times I'll hate and want to blow my brains out. I keep having these conflicting thought processes. Sometimes I think this is all a ""fetish"", but other times I think back to how I've always thought of myself being the woman during sex since I even discovered sexual feelings in late childhood/early puberty. I feel like I die and am born again every single day, like I tell myself ""ok, no more trans thoughts, from this day forward, I'll be the manliest man!"", but then I get severely depressed and I will starting thinking about being trans again, and wishing I was in a woman's body. But then my conservative nature will hit me,  and I'll tell myself to ""man up"" again and try to force myself to focus on other things, but even then, these thoughts are always in the back of my head. Part of me feels like I'm repressing myself, and another part of me feels like I'm just pretending this is all real as a panacea to justify my own personal problems and deeply troubled childhood.

I think i might be trans,"my sex is female, but i struggle to identify with any of the girls at school. 90% of the friends i have made at high school have been boys. I despise most things  ""girly""  (makeup, dresses, being ladylike, sports we do in Pe) and what is expected of me as a woman when i'm older. I identify more with boys and my male friends and only recently began to doubt my identity.

if there was a button to make me a boy, i like to think i would press it. BUT i am not sure if it's just a phase or i've just convinced myself id be happier as a boy.

i feel dissatisfied as a female and i thought i would talk to some people online before i talk to anyone IRL.

I began to doubt my self, i don't ""feel trapped"" like what i've heard from others, i dislike my boobs but not my genitals and i just feel i would be happier if i was viewed in others perspective as a boy rather as a girl. i only began to wonder about this about a week and a half ago. about 6 months ago i bought myself a binder because i disliked my chest, but those feelings went away and i felt unconfortable wearing it because my mum kept calling it a ""boob squasher"" ( I never told her i felt unconfortable about her joke and i don't think she meant badly either). My doubts have come in waves just over and over again and i just wanted to hear other peoples experiences. i have a friend whos only 15 and came out as trans and im scared im just trying to identify with him (Ftm) or copy or got inspired.

\- I remember when I was around 15 thinking it's best to be a girl, then boy, then man, then worst to be a woman. I've always been scared of getting older though.

\-Felt indifferent to people calling me pretty/beautiful. Not to sound conceited (trying tot be as honest as I can here) but I know I'm fairly good looking, so I just don't care what other's opinion is. Also I'm used to it, mainly from family.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I'm cis:

\- No dysphoria, even when at my most anxious questioning. In fact, almost the opposite; I feel uncomfortable with how wide my shoulders are, and still am unhappy with how boyish my body is in general (narrow hips/wide waist, flat chest, skinny thighs). Not because I want to be perceived attractive, but just because I'd prefer to have a girlish figure.

\-Being trans just makes no sense?? I'm happy as a girl and always have been, yeah my sexuality is a bit confused and I find it hard to connect to people but I may just be a weird, introverted person? I feel like I'm looking at transness as a magic pill that answers all my lifes problems.

\-Whenever I've fantasied sex, I've been a female (I know the reverse is a common thing with trans people). I've never had fantasies of being a boy - occasionally I've thought 'if i was a boy i'd wear that and look cool', but nothing serious. In my daydreams I'm always a girl - there was one summer, on a road trip, I'd imagine myself being lolita and dancing around.

\-I like being a girl! I've even written in my journal about how lovely female friendship is and stuff.

\-I've connected to female characters in books (I don't remember about male ones), and queer female love stories. Unless I'm actually a straight boy just fetishising them...?

\-I used to think about women doing steroids and I couldn't believe they'd willingly want to inject testosterone! Like it was very alien and weird to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Since being a teenager, I've felt a bit insecure about being masculine, not in how I behave, but my body. I remember constantly looking at my fingers  to see the ratio between index and ring (my rings are longer), as it shows how much testosterone you were exposed to as a fetus. My I feel weird about my chest because it looks like a boy chest with boobs stuck on, because I'm skinny with wide shoulders and small boobs. Sometimes when I'm doing something my brain just goes 'that's a boy hand doing the writing' and I hate it.

If the questioning just went away, I'd be perfectly happy. I've thought about the button test a million times, the answer is I don't know! I imagine if I woke up with a penis and a flat chest and hairy legs etc. and it just feels weird to think about? I don't think I'd hate it, but I don't long for it either. I actually shave my legs a lot, even in winter, cause I like being all soft and smooth.

I think maybe I'm bigender?? Or like Jung's animus - there's a boy I could have been, like a twin. I'm happy being a girl, I just want to know if the questioning will go away. I've read dysphoria never goes away, it comes back stronger each time. But this isn't dysphoria, it's just my brain questioning and being obsessive like it always does. Also, it's less strong this third time. I'm aware of non-dysphoric trans people, but I don't want to be a boy enough to transition.  I can imagine myself as a boy, but it's not something I long for.

But yeah, this is my story, I'm only posting because I haven't come across one like mine. Thanks so much for reading, I will appreciate anything you have to say!

I don't know if I can be trans anymore!,"I know I am transgender, I know that dont even have to think about it. The thing is I'm so alone, I have no friends, no family,and no one likes me enough to go on a date with me( especially when they find out I want to be a woman) and it hurts so much. I go to work, I go home that's all I do. I try and try to get people to hang out but it always falls apart at the last minute. At first I was okay life gets in the way, but every single time that cant be life right? It has to be me! I know my jokes are lame, and I'm not all that cool to hangout with, but I'm loyal and loving and kind. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!! I have to be throwing off some kind of vibe that, I don't notice that's scaring everyone away. I spent 10years in my home because I was attacked and sexually assaulted and I feel more alone now than I ever did then. 

I want to die, but I know I can never take my own life!  Although if some outside force would happen, that threatened me I would let it happen. I even have a note on me at all times that says do not Resuscitate that I have signed. I don't know if it works that way, but I have it on me. I should also say that I don't want to die. I just feel like it has already happened.

I didn't choose to be trans, but I did choose to go down that path. Maybe god is real and this is my punishment to never have a true friend or to know love.

I was born a female and for a while I thought I was a transmale, but now I'm having second thoughts. I want to get rid of my chest and I really do want a deeper and masculine voice. But I'm scared to get sex rearrangement surgery, and I find myself not really caring if people call me a she/he after experimenting. My name sounds feminine, but it doesn't really bother me either.

A friend of mine (female) asked a question regarding relationships with other trans teenagers.,"Hi all, I am a teenaged male. This happened this summer, around 3 and half months ago. A few of us were at someone's house, and eventually we got onto the topic of some LGBT stuff.

One girl in the group asked me whether I'd kiss an mtf girl once they told me that they were trans (assuming we had some romantic feelings towards each other). A few of the guys put forward their viewpoints, and then wanted to know about mine. Needless to say, I was quite nervous in case people jumped to conclusions too quickly. I didn't want to go too deeply at the time, but I answered as much as I was comfortable with.

I said that I would accept her for who she is, but at the same time, this would be new to me, and feel slightly weird and awkward. But that's okay (assuming they understand why someone might feel a bit weird at first). As long as we can both move forward and work to get past this feeling of awkwardness and help me to see that she's like any other girl, then that's all that matters. I would still care about her just as much.

What do you think about this? Is this a good way to go about it? I'd genuinely like to hear other people's take on this question, and what might be the best way to handle situations like these.

(And, yes it is *only* a scenario and not real life but either way, if it was to happen sometime in the future it's just something to think about.)",asktransgender
How long does hair recovery go on?,"My diffuse hair loss, which got pretty serious in my mid 20s, was one reason I thought transitioning was impossible, but I eventually decided to live my life.

I started HRT seventeen months ago, at 38. Within the first few months, lots and lots of hairs that were barely noticeable tiny blonde hairs turned into much more serious fuzz. Over the last year, that fuzz has gotten longer, and some of the hairs have turned into thick, dark, terminal hairs. I keep noticing, even right on my hairline, new grown up hairs coming in.

But, there's a long way to go, because my hairline was pretty far gone. Most of the time I wear a wide headband. I actually like my shoulder length curly hair. 

I'm wondering when it will reach ""okay this is what you'll have, without a transplant"" thickness. 

I started minoxidil and 1mg finasteride about 24mo ago, and my trans care doctor put me on spiro/e and 5mg/day fin seventeen months ago. My T dropped to female range quickly. I still use minoxidil once a day, and a dermaroller every few days. 

I still have thousands of those vellous hairs. They're longer than they were when I first noticed them growing, but only a fraction have turned terminal. The top and back of my head is so much thicker than two years ago, but still too thin to have a normal hairstyle.

How long will this recovery process keep going? If those ""long fuzz"" hairs turn terminal, I could have a hairline again someday.

Have any of you been at this point, and continued seeing regrowth well past a year into HRT?",asktransgender

dealing with narrow/high iliac crests and iliac furrows,"i have the classic male ideal apollo's belt/prominent iliac furrow due to narrow and high-set hips. it is extremely distressing most of the day and feels like i have them tied tightly with a binder. this is despite having been on hormones for several years (i was much too old to get any structural changes) and having done almost zero exercise for this time. it goes from bad early in the day to horrible later as my stomach fills up. 

do there exist any surgeries or medications (experimentalness or riskiness is no concern) that can alleviate this problem at least in appearance if not inherently? gaining or losing weight does nothing as there is no fat that grows over the offending area ([highlighted on this male model](https://i.imgur.com/urG2L2C.jpg). as far as i know fat transfer cannot make this area appear natural.

please don't tell me this is normal or looks fine, it is not and does not unless you are a man (yes i am aware that top tier female athletes may have something similar but it is not the same and i am not a top tier athlete). and please don't condescend if you started hrt young or had naturally wide hips

I don't feel natural,"and I think it's held me back from embracing life, or myself, for years now. every since I began my transition, I have been in a process of accepting myself for what I need and who I want to be, even when I've felt like I was sure of things, I continue to re-think, explore, and learn about myself, which has been nice.

though today, I was looking through my old toys from childhood, some with my birth name on them. it reminds me of being care-free and okay with myself as I was. I was really into dinosaurs and monsters, my mom would build Zoids with me. I liked ""boy"" stuff and it was okay. It still is okay, but now it feels filtered through a different lens. the same with my name. it was simply that, my name, no other connotations.

I guess I just want to be ""me"". I don't think it's healthy or wise to give up everything I've learned about myself, my needs and my femininity, my identity. but I can't shake the feeling of wanting to be naturally female, whatever that means. I want to have a period, but I never will. my body feels out-of-sync and hormones only do so much.

searching for a particular webcomic w/trans characters,"hey all! 

a while back I started reading a really beautiful webcomic with several trans characters, but now I can't remember the title so I can't find it again. it was done in a really gorgeous watercolor style and had a non-linear, chapter-based story tied to various objects. the setting was either slightly futuristic or hinged on magical realism, and people could catch a degenerative condition where they'd lose all their memories and sort of fade away into ghosts of their former selves and be blank silhouettes. one of the main characters was a transfeminine nonbinary person searching for the owner of several mementos to, iirc, save her neighbor from that same fate. i have the worst memory for characters' names so i'm totally lost trying to find it! it's currently unfinished and i wanted to check up on it again. let me know if it rings a bell!

Bigender....or something,"After puberty and throughout high school I knew I didn't want to be a girl and had dysphoria so I assumed I was a trans guy. Though I feel best looking masculine and dressing in men's clothes I don't really want to become a MAN, if that makes sense. I don't have much bottom dysphoria, I don't try to hide feminine aspects of myself, etc. I just feel so weird sometimes. I look butch but my mannerisms and really everything about me is 50% masc and 50% fem.

But I don't want to just switch and become a normal guy. I'm bisexual, and I feel strange about that too

TLDR: I feel in the middle of the spectrum and I'm most comfortable there but I feel pressure from society and the stereotypical trans narrative to pick a side. So I've settled for being a guy but that doesn't feel right either. I just feel trapped by my gender identity and don't know how to move forward.

I also want to say that my child and I have always had a really close relationship, even to this day.

It's hard for me to relate because even though I've had to struggle with things like my own sexuality, and even struggled with issues of gender and what it means, I never once wanted my body to be different. My question for trans people in this thread is in what ways did your parent or important adult in your life connect with you? Did you ever feel like they had an understanding of what was going on with you or could relate to your struggle? Or was that even necessary to have to relate, and loving you was enough? What do you wish they would have done more or less of to help you?

My son has always been my shining star in my life. I just love him so much, I'll do anything for him. So anything I can do to help this transition from male into female easier for him I want to do.

Came out to more of my family. My Identical twin has been making it really weird,"Ok long story short. Ive been coming out to more and more family this year. The family is mixed on reactions. I recently came out to my identical twin. I was fully expecting him to say he doesnt understand. I thought he would tell me he isnt this way. The first reply I got was him being unable to understand how we could be identical twins and both not be trans. Honestly, I liked that response. The last thing I ever wanted was for him to tell me he was the same. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what Ive been through, so I was relieved. However, I recently received a large letter from him explaining how hes been dealing with the same feelings his entire life. Honestly is strange how similar our life has been. Btw, it should be noted that we are not close, do different things, and have never really talked to each other our entire life. On the outside we look way different. So if anyone is questioning a biological component , this experience has been quite affirming. The problem is, he tells me he has coped and found a way to live with it. He doesnt feel like acting on those feelings is the right choice and is very critical of it. Its scary because this is where i was in my opinion years ago. I thought I had gotten over it. Now I fear that his coming out will invalidate me with on the fence family members, Because now all they have to say is, "" Your brother is dealing with it. why arent you?"" Its hard because I know I am far more on top of dealing with my problems. Therapy, doctors, and support groups are weekly activities and hes never seeked help from anyone. how to I deal with this.

Feeling weird about 'male' mental fixations and habits?,"Hey, so I'm in the whole aaaaaa stage of questioning, and I've finally been admitting that there might well be good reason to believe I'm trans. One thing that still unsettles me, though, is how characteristically 'male' a lot of my insecurities and mental worries have been in the past (and even are now?). 

For example, after puberty, when my issues of depersonalisation, depression, anxiety etc hit, I found myself fixating a lot on, well, manliness (I'm AMAB) as a positive source of self-improvement, etc (I actually managed embody those manly traits pretty well as of late too, and even then it didn't really feel real). Men and male figures were who I largely aspired to, identified myself as wanting to be, and so on- all while horribly depressed, etc. Similarly, if I had a girlfriend who made out with another girl, I'd feel hurt, but not as hurt as if she made out with a guy. Another example's kinda subconsciously 'othering' women to some extent- whereas I intuitively see most guys for what they do and say, it's hard not to see girls as Being Female before anything else. 

It's just little, 'typically male' mental habits like that that really unsettle me, because they make me feel like maybe that's just what I am, and all of this possibly-dysphoria's just me, or some mental illness's symptoms misinterpreted. And they don't unsettle me just because they're toxic habits in themselves- although that plays a part- but specifically because they're so gendered toward the male end of the spectrum. But on the other hand, I guess it could be social conditioning- I've thought of myself as male without any alternative for a long time now, after all. I don't know.  And the fact that it does unsettle me doesn't seem like a hugely cis quality? Like, why would I care about that if I were a guy?

Does any of that make sense, and point towards like, possibly not being trans, or am I just being stupid and confusing learned emotional habits with essential traits? (I'm probably just being stupid, but I could really use some thoughts on this one).",asktransgender
Muffing (Not Muffins),"Okay so I (F 20) remember watching a vid on muffing years ago during the beginning of high school. Tucking seemed so so scary and made me incredibly uncomfortable. But once I got a year into college, tucking became hella easy.

But looking back at it now, maybe it was a bad idea to do that? I'm not sure if I should've made that decision on my own because there might have been a reason for me to start with one pump..

"i cant live my life, being mid-transition is shit, being post-puberty is shit, everything is shit. how do i do things when i cant leave the house","how do you do it   


rant about my shitty situation thats really not any worse than most peoples:

my face is ugly and male. my voice is male. makeup wont fix bones (not sufficiently).  i need to get a job but i cant face even going to a restaurant with family without feeling like everyones staring at me.  i dont want to go back to wearing male clothes, and i dress androgynously because wearing female clothes while not passing doesnt work for me.  ive literally wasted 3 years of my life leeching off my parents and being a recluse (from 21 to 24 years old).  i cant face real life when i cant even face the reflection.   i guess i just dont want to try.   i seek constant external validation because i cant be confident in any of my own decisions--even outside of feeling trans.  im vegan yet i struggle to stay true to it, and i dont proudly order vegan food, i meekly ask for it as if to say ""do you accept me for being vegan?"" to the waiter (even when they have vegan options on the menu). its basically the same for my transness, meekly hoping people will accept me, or better yet, not notice my transness at all--meaning they'd see me as a girl and i'd pass, not that they'd see me as a guy and disregard any attempts to show them otherwise, cuz that feels shitty too.     


i need to get a job and yet even stepping in the shower is a struggle.  i have weekly general therapy and another therapy with my gender therapist. i need to bank sperm before i can go back on hormones (which they fricking gatekept me from but long story), which means i need to get a job first.   


why does everything have to be so out of order. literally everything would be fixed if i had come out prepuberty, and instead, i have to suffer MORE for staying closeted.   its like mandatory ""real life"" treatment without it being mandated.  i cant stand the thought of just living as a guy again till i make enough money for surgery, but then again, thats probably how people see me anyways, so i guess fuck it.

It's hard to throw away some of my old clothes.,"Although I know I'll never wear most of my old clothes ever again, I still feel as if I'm throwing away a very important part of myself. Of who I were before! I feel like I'm mourning the loss of someone. I miss my old self and I wish I could get her back, but I'm not her anymore...

It's really not that long ago since I would buy anything hippie and bohemian like outfits I could find, and my closet were an explosiaon of colours. Flowers, rainbows and cute kittens. I were born in 84 but I feel very nostalgic for some reason towards the 60s, 70s and the hippie movement. So I've been really into clothes like that for many years. My whole life I've never felt uncomfortable with the clothes that I owned. And now, well not so long ago, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable in my tunics, skirts, shirts and tops with perls and beads on! Why now?!

I guess it comes with the dysphoria, but it really sucks!

I don't really have any memories of when it started. But I doubt that my discomfort with my body have been going on that long. All I have are something I wrote about feeling uncomfortable with my female body, ""mai 7, 2018."" But I know from the few memories I have that I did not like playing the role of the mother when we in the kindergarten played family. It felt really awkward and wrong sitting with a baby doll on my lap, pretending to breast feed it. So I never touched the doll. I always used to be the family dog or something. And in elementary school I rather be a male character when we played something. I remember when I played ""Power Rangers"" in the backyard with the neighbour boy we always fought over which of the male characters to be. I remember feeling so powerful when I did a flying kick through the air as one of the ""Power Ranger"" boys. And I of course always had to be ""Throttle"" the boy mouse from ""Biker Mice from Mars."" I'd be so upset if anybody else wanted to be him. Then came years and years of BJD boy character collectibles, creating male characters and in the sims games. And anime and manga (BL)  gay related series.

But I never ever felt anything wrong about the body I were born with. So you can only imagine how frustrating it is to feel like this now.

I don't know what to believe. And it's like the dysphoria I struggle with now does not make any sense to me, even though I have a couple of things I remember from when I were younger.  I just don't understand how it can come like that so late in life???

How do I differentiate between fear and not wanting to transition?,"I don't even know what I feel anymore. Before HRT (7 months in) I was so much sure that I'm trans, but here I'm and I'm doubting EVERY single day of my transition. 

At the beginning I was so excited about each and every change that my transition brought, but now I just kinda feel neutral about it. Oh and regarding my breasts, they grew up quite a lot and now I'm hyperconscious of them and feel even slightly negatively about their size.

On some days I rather look like a girl who's trying super hard to look like a man and I can't interpret how I feel about it. Yes I still look obviously look like 100% AMAB, but I believe that within a few months that won't be true.

Only thing that transition helped me realize is that I identify either with guys who are super femme or with tomboy girls who can kick ass.

Weight and GCS (MTF),"So at this point I have no other milestones to hit for GCS. I need letters, insurance approval, a surgeon, and a date. However I do have an issue. My weight.

"Girlfriend had GCS Monday, recovery questions","My girlfriend (30 years old, 7 years HRT MTF) had her Vaginoplasty performed at University of Utah hospital on Monday, she's supposed to be released tomorrow, but I'm concerned about a few things that the hospital seems rather blase about.

For one, they required her to begin a purge 36 hours in advance of the surgery, meaning from midnight on the 20th to surgery she had nothing but liquids and an entire container of miralax. Her last solid movement was right after beginning the purge, and only liquid since until Tuesday, at which they stopped completely. In the three days since, even though she's been eating solid foods during this time, she hasn't had any bowel activity. Worse, she can't eat because it feels like there's nowhere left for any of it to go. We're a bit concerned that her vaginal canal(which is still packed full btw) might be blocking intestinal movement, or damaged nerves in that area.

Does anyone who has had GCS have any wisdom to share? No nice way to ask this, how long after your surgery did it take for your first bowel movement?

**Edit** - she's been on miralax and sennakot in the hopes of opening up the flow, but nothing as yet. I'm mostly worried because attempts at force feeding herself have resulted in severe nausea at even the scent of food. As for the doctors, the nurses know, but I haven't seen any of the surgeon's beyond the plastic surgeon checking in every morning. Nurse is checking to see if anyone from the surgery team will be here tonight.

Am I transgender? Dealing with some doubt,"This may or may not be a long story so fair warning coming into this.  I'm just looking for advice atm.

So I've been more or less questioning my gender identity since junior year of high school.  I can see signs that I might've been trans earlier than that, but I can't tell if this is genuine evidence or me grasping at straws.  I've hated my body for a while now and I know hating your body doesn't necessarily means dysphoria, but whenever I imagine how I want to look I don't want to look like a handsome man but a pretty woman.  I've been envious of cis girls since high school for various reasons and I've spent hours in the past looking at pretty girls on my computer, being envious of their looks, and wishing I looked like them.

I currently attend a religious college (for financial aid reasons) and my parents are very transphobic.  So I' decided that I'll wait until I graduate college and become financially independant before starting any medical transitioning.  I'll graduate, get a job, move out, visit a doctor, go on HRT, and continue with my transition.  I've done minor things like wear nail polish, experiment with makeup, wear girl clothes when I'm alone, tuck, and wear a sports bra...I'm even going as Harley Quinn for Halloween (it's Halloween so at worst people will think it's a joke).  Nothing permanent as of yet.  Since coming out to a very close friend, I've been slowly embracing my trans status within the confines of the closet.

But recently I met another MTF trans woman who is in a very similar position as I am.  We both attend the same school and we both haven't started medically transitioning as of yet.  She, however, has come out to her parents and the school faculty knows she's trans and on campus.  She is currently staying in the boys dorm (for now) but in her own room to herself.  She even plans on having a doctor visit in a few months and starting HRT while attending college.

After we had a conversation recently about our similar experiences, she told me that she doesn't know how I could handle experiencing dysphoria for a few more years without transitioning since she almost committed suicide in high school and is desperate for her HRT.  I was suicidal in high school too, but I don't even remember if dysphoria had anything to do with that.  And since coming to my college and making great friends through my campus's GSA (I am openly bisexual), I haven't had any suicidal thoughts.  I still think I experience dysphoria (not to mention depression and anxiety but that's unrelated...I think?...maybe?  idk...), at least I still wish I was a girl, but it almost seems as though her dysphoria is worse than mine or maybe I don't actually have dysphoria to begin with?  I don't know.  I honestly don't want to be a man anymore.  If I could trust my parents with this information, I would've started transitioning a long time ago.  I wouldn't call my current position ideal (not by a LONG shot), but if I feel safer (not necessarily more comfortable) waiting until I'm financially independant to transition rather than desperately going after HRT like my life depends on it, do I even have dysphoria?",asktransgender

Egg Donation for Tran Men?,"I've been considering donating eggs for a bit. I mean, I don't want them, but since I'm trying to stay closeted at least a bit more I won't be ripping that shit out for a while, so I figure I might as well get something out of having them. I do know the process involves hormone injections. I'm not on hrt currently, but I'm worried that this might make things harder when I want t later.

"Some questions -warning, perhaps bit long","\-will probably be long, probably a TL;DR below.-Also I'm not natively English so sorry if I make some mistakes in my grammar here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

\-*Introduction*Hello,First of, an introduction. I'm 16yo AMAB, but lately I've been thinking about things. Things that someone maybe could help me find out. Now I know most will probably say something along the lines of ""It's your own journey to explore/Ponder on that yourself, it's about you after all"" but what i want is someone to think *along* with me, not to think *for* me. So now let me recite that one question that everyone has probably heard here ""Am i transgender?"".

&amp;#x200B;

\-*the basics*So let's try to start from the beginning of my ""journey"". It all started around 1.5 years ago, what started? Well, questioning myself of course. The reason what started it, I've got no clue. Due to the discussion of politics with my friend? Perhaps, but it made my everyday life have a different outlook on a lot of things. For example, I've become more liberal than i used to be, I am now trying to  grow my hair out, trying to look like a *girl.* Yeah, you all know by now ""oh, he wants to look like a girl"" and yes, I'd like that, more so than me being a manly man. but here is one of my major question **""the statement: ""you're a girl of you want to be one"" how does that work?""**

&amp;#x200B;

\-*reflection on my past self*

It's weird, Reflecting back on past moment, but i remember this one really vivid dream, It's where I was in my old room, and it wasn't like a dream where you get to walk around. It was just me, in my bed, comfortably covered in a blanket. But always in this dream (which I had multiple times when I was younger) there were girls? I don't know, but some people putting female clothes on me. Was this dream just a giant foreshadow of what is now the questioning of myself? So now for this question, **""Is being transgender neurologically wired into our being, and does it affect people on a subconscious level, even if they don't know they are trans?""** Now continuing on, my past self was bullied for most of my elementary school days, throughout grade 4 to mid-8 (this is in Dutch education so american equivalent would be 2nd grade to mid-6th) so for 4 years I've been bullied. Would this in any way, shape of form, leave a neurological ""scar"" that could amplify certain feelings? But also, have any of you just sat somewhere and just WISHED you wanted to be a girl, even praying to god although you're atheistic, and also trying different languages just to be safe, just me right. A bit nsfw here, but almost every (biological) guy has probably tried this at least once. Where you tuck your penis between your legs and look at yourself in a mirror and go like ""haha, I'm a girl"". Well when I did it when I was younger I would get \*cough\* ""excited"" looking at that reflection, that's probably not what everyone doing that feels like, do they now.

&amp;#x200B;

\-*Side note*

Now not so much about me, but about science and understanding, I've occasionally stumbled across some papers about transgenderism and I have of course heard about the term ""autogynephilia"". But I've heard a lot of people saying it's false, so could anyone provide me with an explanation/debunking the meaning of that word, or just provide some papers that I can read.

\-*Internet*While this may seems controversial in the eyes of some, my curiosity is peeked towards a certain topic. The effects of social mediums like Reddit, 4chan (yes, just let me be an edgelord over here), etc. For instance in a scenario where I wouldn't stumble upon websites like these. Where I was left pure and untouched by the horrors of the internet. Would I  have felt the way I do now? Or does browsing r/egg_irl and r/traa just make me feel stronger about these thoughts in my head. Just as what happens with political opinions, the feed of constant content makes one think about certain things with a radicalizing point of view after all. Has it ever been proven by research? Who knows, but I have a lot of experience in social media radicalizing people. After all my best friend, went from being ""immigrants are bad, okay"" to denying the statistics of the number of deaths in the holocaust. So I want to ask this question \*\*""What effect does social media have on people with certain thoughts, amplify them? make them more obvious? Which is it.""\*\**PS: Even though my friend and I differ on a political point of view, that does not mean that we can't be friends, even if he doesn't have the same moral values, that does not make his opinions worth less, even if he one day becomes a Nazi (although that isn't even possible as he isn't a socialist) he'll still be my friend. (although this will probably change once I break out of my half-broken eggshell and tell him that)*

&amp;#x200B;

\-*Present*As of today, I'm sitting at my desk, 4am, thinking about sleeping. But I have to finish this at least. I've half accepted I'm trans, half not. But one thing is obvious, I absolutely hate shaving, the body hair, but you have to shave if you don't want to look like a man. To me it's just a sisyphean task. but I hate on part more than anything, my adam's apple. I don't know but even though it's not swollen or anything like that, it still bugs me. Touching it absolutely disgusts me. Am I unique in that aspect or is that just something that every guy has?. Anyways, let's get back to the main focus,  I've been feeling this way for around  3/4th's of a year now. And I noticed that I'm becoming a bit jealous, not only of girls, but also some guys who manage to pass when they cosplay. Again with something a bit controversial, but traps, Not in the lewd way but the cosplay side of things. When I see someone pass flawlessly I become a bit jealous. Naturally that's not really normal. I know that it's obvious, yes I may perhaps be trans, it's something I perhaps just need to accept. But having someone's view on problems you've been dealing with can sometimes shed a light on things. Anyways, I'm going to sleep.

TLDR:16yo AMAB, questioning gender. got some questions that i'll put below.

1. **""the statement: ""you're a girl of you want to be one"" how does that work?""**
2. **""Is being transgender neurologically wired into our being, and does it affect people on a subconscious level, even if they don't know they are trans?""**
3. **anyone got something debunking autogynephilia, scientific papers or just an explanation will suffice**
4. **""What effect does social media have on people with certain thoughts, amplify them? make them more obvious? Which is it.""**

\-*Afterword*I know this has been kinda long, maybe a bit too personal for my own liking, but it was also part self-exploration for me. So I hope I can perhaps find some feedback or something when I wake up.

PS:  What is dysphoria, what is the feeling. Is it just a slight inconvenience or does it make a bit sad. for an example is me being a little down after a co-worker of mine telling me her opinion of me as a ""Kind *boy*"" count as dysphoria? or the example I gave about my adam's apple.

I came out today because politics,"(trigger warning for mention of suicide)

Other than voting, I have literally no idea what else I can do about this situation.  I'm 3 months on T and had planned a slow coming out to first secure financial security. 

No time for that now. All I can do is hope that by becoming visible, it puts the image of an everyday person into people's heads when they find out I'm trans, thereby normalizing and humanizing it... and ideally that may sway a few votes.

""Oh, but my stylist is trans! I love her/him/(whatever people call me is secondary to them making the connection that I'm just a human at this point)! I would never get a service from anyone else!"" And seriously, I care much more about the sentiment behind people's realizations than pronouns at this point.

I deeply regret staying closeted now because I see my clients on monthly rotations and I won't have an opportunity to come out to all of them before the midterms. Potential chances for change were wasted by my fear.

My fear of harm after coming out is warranted, but after all the shitty news this week, for me the stakes of staying closeted are even higher. If I'm forced off HRT, I WILL commit suicide. If legislation makes care impossible to obtain, we are all fucked. I'm willing to risk some sneers, stares, losing a few clients and to start carrying mace because fuck me I won't submit to this quietly.

I just want to feel normal and be happy living peacefully as I am. I've suffered three decades to find this peace, why should I give it up to someone who hates me?

Finally, I'm changing my gender markers NOW because I want the list of names erased to be as long as possible. I want the person doing the erasing to have to spend extra time wiping me out so they know just how many of us exist. 

That's all I've got for civil disobedience at the moment. 

And for the record, everyone I came out to, personally and professionally, was ultra supportive. Mind blowingly so.

I'm am praying the flip side of the current legal torment is increased visibility, and therefore normalization. We're not monsters or the butts of jokes in bad movies, we're normal people who contribute to society. 

Note: I'm not advocating coming out if it endangers your life. I have much more leeway than some in my personal situation. No shame if your situation is different, we all need to stay safe and alive, so my intention isn't to push or shame anyone who can't safely come out. Please don't misunderstand.",asktransgender
I am scared about SRS and I could really need some positive experiences,"I got some people in my life that are not that happy with their post SRS experience and while i know that studies show that most are, it is still dragging me down.

My surgery is scheduled for May (in 213 days) but I keep thinking about it almost it every day. On one day I can't wait until I finally have that fixed but the next day I am super scared again and questioning everything.

Feeling Acceptance Only After Coming Out (How does that acceptance feel?),"So if you have read any of my previous posts you'll know I've been struggling the last couple of weeks.  So I don't know what this is but it seems like acceptance.

I have been able to dress secretly in my siblings clothes and while there is still a sexual aspect that makes me nervous, it has felt okay, not euphoric or dysphoric just clothes.  I shaved my chest, again, not euphoria but nothing that was screaming no.  Makeup is the same way.  I came out to an old co-worker who was accepting and has even offered to take me shopping and help with makeup, even providing me a safe place while I get ready to move out, and for which I am grateful (and a little excited).  I recently came to the conclusion that if it weren't for the social and religious aspects I don't think I would be opposed to living as a woman.

I have talked to my therapist for the last couple of sessions about the questioning, and that I have always considered the doubts intrusive, alhough I'm fairly certain that is simply due to the fact that every part of my upbringing declared it as wrong.  She said that she thinks, but doesn't know, that I just like crossdressing and proceeded to wonder if OCD runs in the family, (it might but I'm only the second one in the family to ever see a therapist), and then put forth the option of taking antidepressants due to my belief that the thoughts were intrusive as a way to possibly control them again saying it hasn't been crippling or from a young age. (24 questioning for 7+ years)

**TLDR;** I don't know why but the answer that I always thought I wanted, that I am not trans made me a little sad and almost teary when she said that. I don't think anybody really wants to be trans, but I almost feel like I have convinced my self that I am and that I just need to take the next steps slowly, but take them all the same.

I haven't really thought about my identity for the last couple of days other than to lurk on these forums but I don't feel the anxiety or stress much still just a lingering thought that I can still tough it out and live as a man or that maybe I've some how convinced myself I am trans though I fairly certain nobody really wants to do that.

**Question;** So here is the question my parents will likely think I just deluded myself into finally accepting my gender, but did anyone feel sad when somebody told you they didn't think you were trans or the other gender even though that's the answer you were secretly hoping for, and did it solidify the conclusion, or what does acceptance feel like?

"I'm finally going to do more than just dream about it, I booked an appointment with a psychologist and see her today, lots of questions!","AMAB and I'm in my mid 30s, I'm finally taking the steps to get the process started.  It pains me to look at the age of this account and know where I could be right now instead of all those more years of testosterone doing things I can't undo, but better late than never right!  I just got out of rehab for heroin and while I was there I came to the realization with the help of a therapist that if I don't do something about my incongruent mind and body, that I would eventually purposely OD to spare my family of a blatant suicide.  I still don't know how I'm going to tell them about transitioning as my mom and brother as they're both extreme conservative and homophobic/transphobic, but depending on the dosing I could potentially go a long time without them being full aware, correct?  


I know everyone is different, but if I ask to go at a lower/slower dosing regime, how long might I be able to go without obvious breast growth?  Is there any combination of T blocking and some kind of E that reduces muscles and redistributes fat that doesn't promote as much breast growth?  Or should I plan to use sports bras and loser fitting shirts until I start presenting?


I know I not going to get any hip growth due to my age, but as fat redistributes, I should expect some to go to my hips, correct?  Anyone have before and after measurements or pictures of measuring straight across their hips(not all the way around).  I'm going to be starting a major weight loss regime, is there a certain amount of time I should be on E before I really go after it so when I do lose weight, that it comes off in the correct places?


Has anyone been in the job market while early in transition?  I'm a programmer(go figure right? lol), is the tech community as trans friendly as I've read about?


Lastly, I'm not sure how to even phrase this, but how do I girl?  I feel like a phony when I say this, but I'm not particularly feminine.  Is it possible that going on E will bring out my inner-girl so to speak?  Like maybe I'm so use to suppressing and hiding all those feelings that once I truly accept myself and start the journey that my femininity will surface?  Or is that a red flag to be questioning such a thing?  I'll definitely be working with my psych on that, but am curious if anyone has had similar feelings as such.  


Sorry for the wall of questions, I'm just so excited and scared right now, like today could be the first day of my life excited, but I know I gotta slow my roll and that today is just the first step and it's time to be completely honest with myself and the psychologist so I can find my true self whatever that may end up being.",asktransgender

"[NSFW] Do you have sex dreams? If so, what are they like?","Hey everyone! I love this sub, and it‚Äôs been a lot of help recently. 

Ok, throwaway time. 

Background info: 27/amab, mtf/enby (still working it out), pre-everything, mostly gynephilic

Sex dreams are suuuuuuper rare for me. I think I can count them on one hand. The few I‚Äôve had involved someone I know irl and included quasi-lesbian stuff, kissing, cuddling, lingerie, intensely romantic feelings, and my body feeling very ‚Äúblurry‚Äù while hers appeared in vivid detail. But they‚Äôve never included piv; and for as long as I can remember, the idea of penetrating someone else has never aroused me, even while masturbating. 

But last night, I had an extremely vivid dream about doin‚Äô it with a friend of mine. It was fun, romantic, very heteronormative‚Ä¶ and it left me feeling really shook. 

Part of it is that she‚Äôs very attractive and fun to be around, but I‚Äôve always considered her ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù because she‚Äôs married. So it‚Äôs weird to feel this way about someone I‚Äôve decided not to entertain feelings for. But the bigger part is the sex itself. 

I‚Äôve always known that something about my gender/sexuality was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, but I‚Äôve only recently accepted the possibility that I might be trans. And one of the aspects of my feminine side that I‚Äôve easily embraced was my disinterest in topping. So experiencing that brain circuit suddenly close was kind of disassociative, like it wasn‚Äôt me doing it. 

Is this normal for mtf‚Äôs? I realize there are transwomen who enjoy topping, so I‚Äôm interested in other perspectives on this. If you have sex dreams, could you describe them? Are they enjoyable? Are they ever dysphoric?

Is my brain male enough?,"Warning: It's a little rant, I'm sorry if I offense you.

So I've been seeing a lot of videos (from both cis and trans people) claiming that our brain are sexually different from our cis pals: trans women have female brain and trans men have male brain and blabla I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. We often use that argument to prove trans people exist, I understand it completely. I believe there's some truth in it but....

The thing is, it doesn't sound convincing (at least, not completely). It even scares me. What if I decide to let scientists study my brain and they conclude my brain' structure is similar to a cis woman brain (I'm a trans guy)? This would totally invalidate my gender identity even though I've never felt like a girl. WHAT ABOUT NON-BINARY FOLKS? Isn't harmful to say that humans' brain follows the gender binary when NB individuals exist? What about intersex people? Are we now forgetting them? It just sounds too black and white for me. 

I'm not dismissing all the scientific studies on trans people. I believe there's a correlation and that's it. But some use those studies as the ultimate truth for our gender identity, and at this point, I'm just thinking ""Is my brain male enough then?"" I don't 100% identify as male (I feel like I'm 60% male, and 40% neutral/non-binary) so obviously this question haunts me and makes me feel uncomfortable/dysphoric.

Coming out to parents as an adult,"So this is a topic that's come up a bunch, but it almost always seems to be about teenagers or young adults. My situation is similar in some ways, but also kind of different.

Brief background, I'm a 34 year old cybersecurity professional. I have a good job, but also a mountain of debt, and a 10 year old child whose mother isn't really in the picture now. For these reasons, I live with my parents. I pay rent, I do my fair share of the housework and all, I'm not a moocher. But I just can't afford to live alone and support my child without severely dropping our standard of living. And for the most part, I love my parents and have a reasonably good relationship with them. So it's really important to me to do this right. 

I've come out to my brother, to most of my friends, and even to my ex-wife's mother, who is basically a second mother to me now and very active in my son's life. She's been super supportive, as has everyone else I've told. But coming out to my parents is a whole different thing. they've known me for 34 years as a male. Coming out to them.. is going to be hard, no matter what. I think they'll eventually be able to deal with it, but I really want to be as prepared as I can, and do it the right way. 

I've been trying to prepare for all the questions/objections they're likely to have. It's tempting to pull the whole ""I'm transgender. deal with it. look it up and educate yourself, it's not my job to educate you"" type of thing I see some people recommend.. but I don't think that'll go over very well, and its important to me to maintain a good relationship with them, for the sheer pragmatic reasons, but also because  I love them and want them to be happy too. and I don't MIND explaining it, if they're genuinely open to hearing what I have to say. 

I'm going to make it clear immediately that my gender is not up for debate, and there's nothing they can say that will change my mind about it, but I will answer their questions if they're asked from an honest attempt to understand. It's not a choice I'm making to be a woman, it's a choice I'm making to stop pretending to be a man. I'm going to tell them how much happier I've been since accepting myself, how much healthier, how much more I've been taking care of myself, losing weight, and so on.

But these are the kinds of questions/objectives I can imagine being raised, and the kind of answers I'd give. None of this is written in stone, I'm not going to read off a script, it's just the general approach I want to take, I think. 

*""Where did this come from, you never seemed to have these feelings before?"" ""Well, I always did, here some examples from my childhood that you might remember that seemed innocent but were actually part of a pattern of me trying to express my gender identity in subtle ways. Also here's some stories you wouldn't have known about, just to illustrate that this is something I've always ""struggled"" with.""

*""But don't you know how hard this is going to be?"" ""Much more than you do, believe me. I'm going to lose friends, alienate most of my relatives, get harassed a lot, and probably face a lot of discrimination in my every day life. But I can't go on living a lie, I just can't. ""

*""But what about your son? How is he going to understand this?"" ""we've already talked about gay people, about gender, and even about transgender people. He really didn't have a problem with any of it. He's a smart, empathic kid. He'll be fine. But to make sure, I'm going to have him see a therapist whenever I get around to telling him, to make sure he has someone he can talk to."" (it probably wouldn't hurt anyway just for any feelings he might be hiding about his mother leaving)

*""But what about your job?"" ""My company is a multi-million dollar corporation that claims to be an equal opportunity employer, and has specific policies against discimination towards transgender people. My coworkers are mostly pretty liberal anyway, I'm actually not that worried about it. ""

*""Are you really sure? what if you change your mind?"" ""I'm really sure. I mean, I have doubts sometimes, but I always doubt myself, I'm a very self-critical person. But I didn't struggle with this realization, I wasn't indecisive. The moment I really asked myself if I was trans, the answer was so obviously yes that I've never seriously doubted it. And if I change my mind.. well, nothing I'm going to be doing for the forseeable future is entirely permanent. If by some obscure chance I change my mind, I'll recover. But I won't.""

*""Why do you want to be a woman/transgender?"" ""Why do YOU want to be a woman? It's not a choice I made. It's just who I am, in my brain. I can't help it that my body doesn't match. And I don't know why. there are theories out there, but no one knows for sure. Only that it DOES happen, and often enough that it's not a fluke, and it's not a mental illness, it's a biological anomaly that results in the gender identity not matching the physical sex"" 

*""Oh no you aren't."" (just as a kneejerk reaction type response) ""This isn't a realization I came to lightly. It's something that's been inside me my whole life, and since realizing it, I've been seeing a therapist for &lt;however long&gt; now, just to make sure I was sure. I know it's difficult to accept and will be very difficult to adjust to, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.""

*""What about some other way to treat it?"" ""It's not a mental illness, therapy or drugs won't 'fix' my gender. The official, doctor-approved treatment for gender dysphoria is transitioning to live as the gender that feels correct.""


So, to get to my actual questions, after all that.. what am I missing? What could I explain better, or what other questions should I be ready for? Or any other advice y'all might have, or anyone whose been through a similar situation who just wants to share how it went for them. I'm also not sure if I want to tell them at the same time, or individually. I feel like my dad might be a little more receptive, so maybe I could talk to him first and then see if he has any insight in how to tell my mom. On the other hand, maybe it would be easiest just to do it all at once, and not have to repeat anything, and just get it out there. I welcome any thoughts on that, too. ",asktransgender

Why do I keep having these thought?,"Hey everyone, sorry if it's a bit long, but I have to share my story with at least someone.

The past 4 months were the toughest months in my life. I won't reveal my age, but I'm in my late teens, and I'm struggling very hard with my sexual identity.

Well, I was born a boy. I grew up as a boy, and I'm writing this post as a boy. And the fun fact is, that I feel like a boy. My conscious is manly, I think like a man. I may be skinny, but In my mind I am very maculine. 

So really, why do I have these toxic thoughts inside my head?

So, to start from the start, I accepted myself as bisexual man. I remember the battles I had with myself a few years ago. Am I gay? Bi? Straight? I thought that it would disappear at the time, but I grew to love it and now it's a big part of me. Loving men and Women equally.

I heard the term transgender before. I knew what it was. I heard stories about transgenders. But I never really paid attention to it because it never bothered me TBH. 

Until 4 months ago. I just scrolled through some pictures in an instagram page. and then I saw a picture of a man. I entered his page, and saw that he's now a woman, and that he transitiond. And then, (I spend a lot of time alone, so I have a lot of thoughts in my head.) I asked myself if I'm transgender. At the start, it didn't really bothered me. So I stopped thinking about it. But a few weeks later, it came back and big time. I remember that I told myself that I hope it wouldn't become a 'thing' right now, but apperantly, it did. 

Since then, I'm struggling, so hard. I never experienced so much pain. I don't feel like I just realized what I am, no. But I got used to think about it, and I'm getting stressed everytime. It turned my life upside down. I just feel like there is no way back, and it makes me feel so sad.

Everything is so complicated. It also depends on how I feel. If i'm happy at one moment, I feel like the man I am, and If I'm sad, So I have all these million thoughts about questioning my gender.

So I went back to my childhood, Seeking for answers. All I remeber is several thoughts that show femininity. And a thousand more that show maculinity. I don't like to wear dresses or put makeup. Never occured to me. When my beard started growing, I became super exited.
Most of my friends were and are male. Now every femminin thing that I do, makes me feel bad. Like I do have some female friends, but if it turns to gossip, I completly avoid it. I don't want to fight myself. I just want to be a happy man, like I was before. 

I feel like the internet is kind of a bad place to look for answers but I really despreate. I just want it to go away.

But my only concern is, that when I really battled myself a few years ago, and now I accepted myself as what I didn't want to be, will happen once again. 

I have really no problem with the trans community, or anyone. Be and let be. I just want some advise from you guys. How do I make it stop? Is it really stoppable?",asktransgender
i think i may be trans but i don't understand it?,"so for quite some time (more like my whole life) i have had those ""traits"" that would make me identify as a man, like i have called myself man and describe my sexuality as a gay (man), i picked myself a male name and treat it as equally real as the name my parents gave me, when it comes to dysphoria im not diagnosed but i think i have it like never in my life i have been comfortable with my genitalia (mostly in sexually context, probably since am sure im a total top) which led me to first believe that im just scared virgin and broken woman that needs to be cured but then i came across bottom dysphoria and it seems about right because if i only had the right set of genitalia i would most likely have normal sex life and also it would be very comforting to have masculine body and voice (that also is very important to me to change it) so i started researching and what i came across was people with bad top dysphoria  and almost non existent bottom dysphoria and i came to the conclusion that im not trans in the end, which of course didn't happened and i continued my journey and i discovered transphobia and it startled me because i realized i may be a little transphobic despite considering myself trans, i think it is  mostly due to not understanding things like ""what is gender?"", ""what makes men a men and reverse?"" like everyone cis or trans have some kind of gender identify and some kind of definitions of what makes them well them but not me like i just feel like i would feel pretty comfortable in masculine body with masculine voice that have entire diffrent genitalia and i hope i can transition one day in a way i consider complete but does that make me a man? like i wouldn't care being still called a woman and stuff. sorry if it seems chaotic but i have never talked about it with anyone, i thought the only way to get out of this nightmare was to kill myself which i planned but for some reason i ""broke"" today and felt like i need help from someone ",asktransgender
I feel like I'm going insane,"I don't know what I want. I've been looking at this trans stuff for months. I don't want to be a man. I don't look at male spaces and yearn for that. I don't like female spaces and women have made me extremely uncomfortable with the assumption that I'm a woman.

I look in the mirror after binding and cutting my hair and I just think ""oh, third gender person, that's you,"" when I *know* that is absolutely not what anyone else sees. My brain is stuck there. It was always there. I was always thinking of myself as ""something else."" I go and do things dressed as what I think of as myself and I realize there is no one in the room that I can perceive as being ""like me"" and at the same time none of them perceive me as different. 

My brain functions totally differently than literally everyone else and it's scary and I am completely delusional. I look up breast reduction and I freak out when I see that the ""goal"" is to be ""proportional"", but at the same time I don't think I want top surgery (and also I'd need to lose like 40 lbs to even be considered, so what's the point of looking?). I have pictures of myself attempting to bind from six year ago, idle thoughts of how if I have breast cancer genes that then it'd be an easy choice to just get rid of them, and still I'm wondering, are these real thoughts? I mean I don't actually want anything, right? How could I?

I don't know what to do. I see a lot of people here wanting to radically change themselves physically and that makes sense. In my case some part of me is completely delusional and thinks that me not being a man or a woman is just totally self-evident and therefore nothing really has to be ""done"". And that part of my brain is why I would consider myself trans because all my life I have had to keep reminding myself that I was my gender assigned at birth and constantly force myself to do things that were really uncomfortable. When I finally decided to actually not do stuff that made me so uncomfortable because putting up with that just for other people's sake is stupid, I found this.

This has been going on literally my entire life. One of my earliest memories was my mother asking what to do with all these barbies I had gotten as a birthday gift because she knew I never touched them. I said the reason I had them was in case ""my friends wanted to play with them"". I was three years old and had already realized my preferences were weird and that I needed to cover them up. It literally goes back that far.

I don't know what to do. I mean a lot of research and people here, they say that being trans is something physical? This isn't physical. This isn't body parts being wrong. My brain just doesn't work and it constantly tells me I'm something I'm not. I think I'm just crazy. ",asktransgender
"hi, i'm back with my constant existential grief","after three weeks of trying very hard not to read anything related to my condition, trying to dedicate more time to my hobbies, looking for all sorts of distractions, thinking ""maybe i can live like this after all"" and feeling overall pretty okay despite still thinking about it 75% of the time, i fell back into the dysphoria-related stress again and, of course, into browsing this subreddit. 

the thing is, that my dysphoria while definitely going beyond all of that societal roles stuff, is always amplified when i get reminded how unconvenient living as the gender i was assigned at birth is. it hurts to think that i was born not only with the wrong body, but also as ""the oppressed one""

it's really not normal to just look at guys and think ""they're so lucky, not having to worry about all of that‚Ä¶""

so maybe all this gender identity confusion might mostly just be me wanting to escape from all of that? what am i running away from? is it really worth it? just what the hell do i want from life?

Trump administration wants to remove 'gender' from UN human rights documents,"From: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/24/trump-administration-gender-transgender-united-nations

Exclusive: US diplomats have pushed for rewriting of collective statements to remove language inclusive of transgender people

Julian Borger in New York

Thu 25 Oct 2018 01.00 EDT Last modified on Thu 25 Oct 2018 01.02 EDT

The US mission to the United Nations is seeking to eliminate the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù from UN human rights documents, most often replacing it with ‚Äúwoman‚Äù, apparently as part of the Trump administration‚Äôs campaign to define transgender people out of existence.

At recent meetings of the UN‚Äôs Third Committee, which is concerned with ‚Äúsocial, humanitarian and cultural‚Äù rights, US diplomats have been pushing for the rewriting of general assembly policy statements to remove what the administration argues is vague and politically correct language, reflecting what it sees as an ‚Äòideology‚Äô of treating gender as an individual choice rather than an unchangeable biological fact.

For example, in a draft paper on trafficking in women and girls introduced by Germany and Philippines earlier this month, the US wants to remove phrases like ‚Äúgender-based violence‚Äù would be replaced by ‚Äúviolence against women‚Äù.

'It still scares me': panic simmers below Trump trans policy protests

‚ÄúWe are seeing this more and more coming up on the Third Committee, and this is going to be a battle in the coming weeks,‚Äù said a UN diplomat. The diplomat noted that US policy on the word is not entirely consistent.

While on a number of recent occasions, US diplomats have called for the removal of the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù, at least once the same word has been added into a text on US insistence.

The diplomat, a European, speculated that the inconsistency might reflect a tussle between different members of the US mission.

To succeed in its campaign, the US will have to forge unusual alliances, with Russia and conservative Islamic states, against its western European partners.

‚ÄúIf you only say violence against women, it doesn‚Äôt really tell the whole story,‚Äù a senior diplomat at the UN said. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be going along with encouraging their society to be regressive. And if that means a blazing row in the Third Committee, I would have a blazing row in committee because I think some things are worth cherishing and worth hanging on to.‚Äù

The US mission to the UN referred inquiries to the state department, which did not offer a comment before publication.

Last month, the state department quietly changed the name of a web page to address transgender issues on passports, from ‚Äúgender designation change‚Äù to ‚Äúchange of sex marker‚Äù, in what appears to be a wider campaign against the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear the administration is engaged in a broad strategy of erasing transgender people‚Äôs existence across the federal government,‚Äù Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said. ‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs infuriating they would behave in such an extreme and volatile manner at the United Nations, we are confident their prejudice will lose out to science, reason, and the ongoing fight for human rights.‚Äù

The New York Times reported on Monday that the administration had drawn up a policy paper to define gender narrowly as restricted as male or female only, and immutable from birth, despite the American Medical Association (AMA) ruling last year that gender and sexual identities are not always binary.

The effort is aimed at reversing changes to federal programs made by the Obama administration. Those reforms made gender a matter of individual choice rather than the sex designated at birth. A leaked memo from the Department of Health and Human Services said government agencies should adopt a definition of gender determined ‚Äúon a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.‚Äù

Roger Severino, the director of the office for civil rights in the department, was a fervent opponent of the Obama reforms. In July 2016, he said that the then defense secretary, Ash Carter, had dishonoured the sacrifices of ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of veterans and current troops who were traumatized, wounded, or died fighting against Nazis, Communist aggressors, and terrorists, yet, believe that biological men should not be allowed into the same barracks and showers as women.‚Äù",asktransgender

Was My Boss In The Wrong?,"So, today at work after work my boss called me into her office, and said that she'd received a complaint from a coworker. I've only been at this job for about a month, so I was nervous, cause I was fairly certain I was getting along really well with everyone. She said that someone had complained about me using the women's washroom.  


Some background on me, I'm currently 3 months into mtf hormone therapy, I wear a bra, shave daily, but I don't wear makeup. My face is relatively feminine and when I'm working it's pretty much a 60/40 split if customers refer to me as sir or ma'am respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my boss I'm trans, and just kinda stared. Didn't feel the need to elaborate. She then asked me if I was ""fully through the process,"" essentially dancing around asking me if I've got a dick or not. I stared at her for a second, because I was shocked she would even ask about that, and honestly wanted to give her an out to rephrase herself. She didn't, so I asked her what she meant by that. She didn't answer, just danced around it and gave a little speech about needing everyone to be comfortable at work. I told her I was 3 months into hrt. She says she ""wished I had told her sooner so we wouldn't have had to have this conversation,"" and I basically told her that I wanted to ease into things since I had just started working there, and you don't know how new employers are going to react to that sort of thing. I felt comfortable enough to come out to a few people, as the jobsite seemed quite friendly towards LGBT people making a pretty unmissable point about it during orientation. She's requested that, instead of using the employee bathrooms, I use the customer bathrooms that are outside of our employee area. Of course I said yes because I wanted the conversation to end quickly, as my hormone levels are super out of balance right now and it's making me really emotional and I didn't want to start crying.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel pretty hurt by this, since using women's washrooms is a pretty new thing for me and something that I consider a very big step towards self acceptance. It's not necessarily that I mind using the customer bathroom, it's about an extra 30 second walk away, but it makes me feel a bit outcast. My question is, is my boss in the right here? I feel, personally, like it would've made more sense to essentially tell the worker to ""suck it up, she's trans, she has a right to piss"" (albeit in a more HR-friendly way) than to exclude me, even if it is in a pretty minor way?

"[NSFW] Do you have sex dreams? If so, what are they like?","Hey everyone! I love this sub, and I‚Äôve found it really helpful. 

Ok, throwaway time. 

Background info: 27/amab, mtf/enby (still working it out), pre-everything, mostly gynephilic

Sex dreams are suuuuuuper rare for me. I think I can probably count them on 1 hand. The few I‚Äôve had involved someone I know irl and included quasi-lesbian stuff, kissing, cuddling, lingerie, intensely romantic feelings, and my body feeling very ‚Äúblurry‚Äù while hers appeared in vivid detail. But they‚Äôve never included piv; and for as long as I can remember, the idea of penetrating someone else has never aroused me, even while masturbating. 

But last night, I had an extremely vivid dream about bumping uglies with a friend of mine. It was fun, romantic, very heteronormative‚Ä¶ and it left me feeling really shook. 

Part of it is that she‚Äôs very attractive and fun to be around, but I‚Äôve always considered her ‚Äúoff limits‚Äù because she‚Äôs married. So it‚Äôs weird to feel this way about someone I‚Äôve decided not to entertain feelings for. But the bigger part is the sex itself. 

I‚Äôve always known that something about my gender/sexuality was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, but I‚Äôve only recently accepted the possibility that I might be trans. And one of the aspects of my femininity that I‚Äôve easily embraced was my disinterest in topping. So experiencing that brain circuit suddenly close was kind of disassociative, like it wasn‚Äôt me doing it.

Question from a cis person,"I was having a debate about the gender spectrum with my class and I think I misrepresented something. I can‚Äôt find a concrete answer on this online so I was wondering if you guys knew.

With the distinction between sex and gender, are transgender people who are born male and identify as a woman regardless of their genitalia or hormones or chromosomes female? Like, if someone were to ask a transgender person who transitioned what sex (not gender) they are, what is the right answer?

Also, with transsexual people, are they the line for being a genetic transition to male or female or are they still considered by the community as the sex they were assigned at birth?

Can someone be male and identify as a female without being transsexual?",asktransgender

I kept going to my LGBT group at my mental health center as a 'genderqueer pansexual' to save face.

[MA / OR] Birth Certificate Gender Change - Physician's Affidavit Requirements,"Hi all,

I am a trans woman currently residing in Oregon, born in Massachusetts. I am in the process of updating my documentation to reflect my new gender and name, but am having a bit of trouble acquiring the documentation needed  to change my Passport and Birth Certificate.

The medical provider who supervises my transition is an ARNP; both the State Dept and Massachusett's Department of  Vital Records require that the affidavit of medical transition be  completed by an M.D. or D.O.

My  provider is telling me that it is not sufficient to have an MD/DO  review my history and sign off, but that I will have to switch my primary care to this physician as well. Because I have other conditions that are well managed by this NP and have a decent relationship established, I'd rather not have to do that.

This is the text of the MA affidavit:

&gt;I  am a licensed physician in good standing in the State or jurisdiction  listed above . I am a physician of the patient listed above, with whom I  have a doctor -patient relationship and whose medical history I have  reviewed and evaluated. I make this affidavit in support of my patient‚Äôs  request for a permanent amendment of the birth certificate registered  with the Massachusetts Registry of Vital Records and Statistics pursuant  to M.G.L. c.46 ¬ß13(e).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
I hereby certify that my patient, listed  above, has completed medical intervention, appropriate for the patient ,  for the purpose of permanent sex reassignment . In my medical opinion  the patient is not of the sex recorded at birth and the sex on their  amended birth certificate should be listed as

Looking at  both the State Department's and MA DVR's language, it should be  sufficient to have my history evaluated by a licensed physician ‚Äì e.g.  the MA affidavit states ""I am **a** physician of ‚Ä¶"", not ""**the**  physician"") while the State dept text includes the option of ""whose  medical history I have reviewed and evaluated"" as an alternative to  ""whom I have treated"".

Is there anything I could bring back to the NP's practice to convince them that it should be sufficient for an MD/DO to meet with me and review my history, or would it be best to find an LGBTQ Family Law lawyer in MA who can help me sort out the details?

So:

* Did anyone else have to change their PCP to successfully change their passport and BC?
  * If not, did you simply provide your history (time on HRT and regimen, supporting documentation from a qualified MHP, etc.) to a physician to get the appropriate statements? Was that sufficient?
* Does anyone have a referral to an LGBTQ-informed Family Law lawyer in the Boston area who might be able to speak to the specifics of MA's interpretation of ""doctor-patient relationships"" and speak with my current physician's office? I'm happy to pay to help get this sorted quickly.",asktransgender

Full makeup for the first time made me freak out. Is this normal?,"My amazing partner helped me do full makeup today, and it was fun, but when I finished the whole thing and actually took a step back to look at myself, the best way I can describe how I felt is putting my emotions in a taffy pulling machine, which is weird, because I'm usually a very even-keeled person.

I was mostly shocked, because I think that was the first time I looked in the mirror and saw someone recognizably approaching female, maybe. Then my stomach knotted up and I thought I just looked like Frankenfurter, and I got incredibly anxious because I realized neither me nor my partner saw a passing woman in the mirror. An anxiety attack for me is just wringing my hands and pacing a lot, but it still felt like a kind of existential crisis. It was a very mixed bag though, because from some angles and some of the selfies I took, I...actually kind of looked like a shadow of what I might *want* to look like. The panic settled down, and it got less jarring to look at myself in the mirror over the few hours I wore it around the house. Some of the smiles in my pictures are even genuine!

I'm kind of unsure whether I had that reaction because it felt *wrong* deep down, or if it was because I didn't pass in my own eyes and that made me feel unattractive and repulsed by myself. Do cis people have strong reactions like this to seeing themselves convincingly presenting the opposite gender? Is this just what it's like early on? I know this sounds like a weird thing to get wound up about, but it's really rare I have these kinds of emotional responses to things. I lowkey wanted to cry for a while, and I legitimately didn't know whether it was happy or sad cry.",asktransgender

Is what I am transgender?,"I‚Äôm physically a guy, age 22. But mentally, I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs been around a year since the last time I really dug deep into transgender issues, and again I find myself asking where exactly I stand and what can be done. As before, I feel I can confidently say a part of me is surely feminine, and repressed both to others and myself. But it also occurred to me that I don‚Äôt necessarily want to be a woman- or, maybe I do, but only if it meant not giving up the things I like about being a man.

The truth is, I like being a man. I like having a penis and muscles and a deep voice, watching sports and hanging out with male friends. I present naturally as a male, whether due to inherent nature or years of growing accustomed to the personality and attending an all-male school. (Frankly, I still wonder how much of who I am today is a direct result of being a social outcast in elementary/middle school and aggressively attempting to codify and embody ‚Äúnormality‚Äù as a response- but I digress.) 

Despite this realization, I would absolutely ‚Äúpress the button‚Äù - as long as I got the chance to change back if I so desired. And, if the button were pressed for me, or if I woke up one day as a girl, I would not only be thrilled but would likely not be bothered if an option to go back was not possible. But when it comes to realistically thinking ‚Äúwould I want to become a woman‚Äù... I have serious doubts. Completely getting rid of my penis for a vagina, and gambling away a reasonably attractive body in the hopes it transitions well? Adapting to all the social pressures that women face, in addition to having to deal with questions of why I made such a drastic change when I was not wholly unsatisfied with my previous life? I don‚Äôt think I could do it, even if I chose to present more tomboyishly.

This also comes on the heels of two major realizations, the first of which being that I am bisexual and not entirely straight. Earlier this year I gave into curiosity and dated a guy, and found it a ton of fun, both socially and sexually. There was still a lot I felt uneasy with, though, whether because it was genuinely not for me or because I was suppressing it for fear of being ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù. I am still 80-90% straight, but I am now at relative peace with being 10-20% attracted to men.

The second is that I‚Äôm deeply attracted to androgyny. This might be attached to the prior realization, but it also goes both ways; while stereotypically feminine women and stereotypically masculine men are plenty attractive, androgynous women and men are what really catch my eye- women with short hair and boyish presentation and men with more feminine figures and facial features. 

This leads me to wonder if perhaps that‚Äôs where I belong, somewhere in between. But I also have many doubts- I‚Äôm essentially wanting the best of both worlds, to be able to act either way, without committing to either ‚Äúrole‚Äù. I‚Äôm more comfortable trying to assume one or the other, rather than trying to combine them, knowing that the combination of the two is seen as weird and does not come across to others as it does to me. To have angled jaw and broad shoulders but sashaying hips, male genitalia but female clothing, muscular form but lithe mannerisms... it feels like I‚Äôm just trying to jam everything I individually find attractive into one image, and it doesn‚Äôt work... I don‚Äôt see it as me. But I can‚Äôt deny that so many individual parts of it are things I would enjoy seeing in myself.

What is there to do, really? It seems so unattainable to reconcile all the different pieces of me into something that still feels like... ‚Äúme‚Äù. As I‚Äôve figured before, it‚Äôs like I have a male and female side, both I identify with but which rarely co-exist. If I ‚Äúpick a side‚Äù, both feel natural, and the more I do either the more I feel drawn to considering that side dominant. Perhaps in the end I‚Äôll have to choose one to put it all under, since I find it difficult to imagine myself living a truly non-binary lifestyle in the same way that others have chosen to do.",asktransgender
On and Off hrt,"The decision to take hormones is not easy. 
There are some posts that report that they start repeatedly with the hrt and stop again. They are considering or not yet ready for the physical changes. After some time they start to listen again because the same feelings come back as before. That can not be healthy.

Which physical or mental changes have happened? Are there permanent changes as well? Due to the constantly changing hormones, does the body lose the ability to produce enough hormones? Did you notice anything in the phases without hrt over time?

Maybe a permanent low-dose hrt would be better. Ultimately, you want the changes, otherwise you would not always start again.",asktransgender
"My [17F] boyfriend [24M] is getting angry at me for my interests and for participating in trans communities, and is, in general, sending me mixed signals.","Hi everybody, last night I made a post to /r/relationships about my boyfriend, I‚Äôve gotten a few DMs that told me to seek further advice in a trans subreddit for more trans-specific responses that might be helpful. I‚Äôm really sorry if this type of post isn‚Äôt welcome here, it just seems like if there were a trans sub to accept it, this would be the one.     

&gt;Hi everybody, I'd like to preface this with some information about myself, first and foremost, I am trans (MtF), however, I've always had very feminine facial features, and am blessed with good genes that have treated me well in my limited time on HRT so that I pass pretty well. My parents have pretty much given up on me since I came out to them, they ignore everything I do that doesn't affect them and very very rarely interact with me. I've always been a *very* shy and quiet person despite the fact that I love people, and as a result, I haven't really had any friends since the 3rd grade.  
I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend Mike for a little over a year now, we met at a local anime convention where I had been cosplaying as a femme character. He came up to me and asked for my number, I was completely shocked and gave it to him, and after that, we started texting daily. He was really surprised when I told him that I was 16, and told me I was very mature for my age and was fine when I told him I was trans. After a month or two he asked me out on a date, and we've been in a relationship since.   
I want to start out by saying how amazing he is, he's been very supportive of me, he's very fun, he can make me laugh, he always tells me how pretty and cute I am, he defended me from his friends (whom I don't really care for), he even let me stay at his place when my parents kicked me out when I first came out to them. Above all else though, he has been providing me with HRT since my parents won't.   
Anyway, recently I've been very interested in a bunch of complex topics that I've started reading about, broad things like philosophy, morality, etc... And since I mostly talk to him, I tried talking about some of these things with him. When I did, he seemed pretty disinterested (as I was kind of expecting), so I stuck to discussing and learning about it in this trans Discord I was loosely apart of. One day, while I was at his place he overheard me debating with somebody on the Discord and he intervened. He got mad and told me online trans communities are toxic and not to use the Discord anymore (which I really didn't mind, because I didn't use it much in the first place) and then started yelling at me about how I sound pretentious and sound like a snob, and that it's making me a pseudo-intellectual, which I understand, but it still kind of irked me. Since then he threw out a couple of the books I was reading, and when I got mad at him for it he said he didn't want me to waste my time on things that don't matter and that I should spend more time with him.   
It's been a day, and I haven't responded to his many texts, the most recent of which are him saying he's sorry and that he'll make it up to me"".
Is there a better way I could be approaching him about my interests? How can I pursue this interest without coming off as pretentious? How should I let him know that I feel strongly about all of this?    
tl;dr my boyfriend is getting mad at me for my interest in philosophy. how can I fix it?  
Edit: I just want to let everyone know that I‚Äôm reading everything, and taking it to heart. I‚Äôm very sad, angry, and confused right now, so sorry if I don‚Äôt reply to everyone.",asktransgender
"[PSA] Make yourself heard, How to Volunteer","It's great to register to vote and cast your ballot (do that asap if you can). 

But if you want to maximize your impact then volunteering is a great way of doing so. If every trans person voted we shift the election by 1% (big), if every trans person got 4 friends to vote it would be 4% (ridiculously massive)




Here's a few methods of doing so

Phone banking:

With this you will be phoneing or texting voters. 

As a bit of knowledge from experience:

- For the most part you are phoning people who are supporters, so bad calls are very rare.

- most conversations are about how and where and when to vote, people might ask for some information on one policy.

My experience with this has been quite rewarding, it's also very valuable as a lot of people just need to be reminded to vote / register.

This one is also really useful because it can be done from anywhere to anywhere, so even if you live in Idaho or Hawaii you can help move swing districts.

Also, for mtfs this can be a great way to practice your voice.


Door knocking:
You go from house to house in a neighborhood asking people if they plan to vote and if they have any questions.


As a bit of knowledge from experience

- You won't be alone, it's standard practice to pair up with somebody else.

- Most people are friendly in person, opponents are likely to just close door.

- Talking with supporters can be very rewarding

This once again is a very rewarding experience, it also can significantly boost turnout and is very important for contacting irregular voters.



Driving voters to the polls:

As a bit of knowledge from friends experience (don't have a driver's license).

- very relaxed experience generally.

- generally ""non partisan"" but you will likely be picking up identified supporters.

- Conversations are very relaxed, you might be asked a few questions by some voters.


With any of these methods you will have the experience of meeting other volunteers which tends to be great. Most volunteeting sessions are 1-4 hours depending on method.


Some Resources: 

A local cadidates office, look up your local candidates office and just drop in. They'll be eager to have you volunteer in any way you are comfortable. (Also often free food and coffee)

Also, don't feel you have already missed out, the last 2 weeks are the most important time of all.

Looking for advice on handling this situation,"Hey all, first time posting here and to Reddit so apologies for any formatting issues or ugliness.

So a bit of quick backstory: I'm currently 17 (MtF) and have been on HRT for ~1.5 months and have a supportive family so no issues there.

Now onto the main issue. Right now I'm attending a school which is only for boys which is all levels of discomfort so I'm moving to another school, nearby but not so close, next year. The only problem is that someone I knew in primary school for all of a year or so is also at this new school. I wasn't particularly close with him but we knew each other decently. Though since he left early I've only seen him once which was about two years ago (which was well before I came out, I only did so this year).

Right now I'm not presenting as how I want to be seen primarily because of my current school situation which is definitely not accepting towards anything that isn't heavy masculine. Recently this guy I knew messaged me (we haven't talked in over a year) and asked if I was coming to his school because he said he saw my name (my current legal but far from preferred name) on the class lists for next year :/

I'm wondering what I should do. Should I talk to him directly about myself and my situation in person next year? Otherwise I'm somewhat fearful of being forced to live as someone I'm not because of a preconceived image someone has created about me. I wanted to be going by my new name and in a different uniform but it seems the only way to do that is to talk to this guy or directly out myself to the entire year group whom I don't know and isn't particularly desirable.

How to deal with friends and loved ones outing you intentionally?,"For the third time in as many weeks, I‚Äôve had a loved one out me, this time I found it‚Äôs my partner‚Äôs 8-year-old son who has gone and told all his classmates that I‚Äôm transgender.

"[advice] Eating disorders, medications, and HRT","Hello,

I'm u/crushthatbit, and I'm about to start the process for getting HRT. I have a few questions that may be better answered by doctors, however some of these experiences are things you might share.

First, I have an eating disorder that has been persistent since my childhood. See r/ARFID for more of what it's like. Basically severe selection of foods, so much so, that I must supplement my body with vitamins to function normally.

Second, I've also been on Risperdal since I was 15, and apparently there's only one thread on this sub that talks about Risperdal, and one commenter on that thread did mention it lowers T levels.

So not so much medical advice, but your experiences with EDs and medications that lower T levels will be helpful as to what my next steps are, and whether I might even be able to start HRT.

Thank you. ü§ó",asktransgender
Can you get marriage certificates reissued after name changes in YOUR state? California is a NO.,"Has anyone dealt with marriage certificate changes after your legal name change?

I was married in California nearly 30 years ago. My spouse and I are both changing our names to our chosen names, and I just learned that while I CAN get my California birth certificate reissued with my chosen name (not an amendment), marriage certificates can not be reissued. They offered, instead, an amendment to our marriage certificate stating we are ""now known as.""

In order to have both of our chosen names (not our birth names) on a marriage certificate within California we must divorce and remarry.

Seriously, how did the activists spearheading the California documents issue miss this one? This totally outs anyone who transitions after marriage.

However, in our current state, Washington, the marriage application legal statement verbiage is ""*... I do not currently have a spouse or registered domestic partner other than the other party to this marriage.*"" Thus, I interpret it as: if we get married again in Washington, we do NOT have to divorce first, because LOOPHOLE.",asktransgender

I need some help with this,"I tried making a list to help me sort my thoughts and work through this cause lists usually do help me, but I‚Äôm literally stumped on this one.

Ever since I‚Äôve been really confused and have looked for help, but I don‚Äôt know anyone who is experienced with this kind of thing 

Anyways, here‚Äôs my list of thoughts 

Reasons I think I‚Äôm trans

- I want primary and secondary female sex traits 
- I want to wear makeup and female clothing
- I want to present as female in my everyday life
- I still have a desire to be female even if it doesn‚Äôt change much (as in how I live my life)
- If I were to push a button to make me female permanently, I‚Äôm 99% sure I wouldn‚Äôt regret it 
- I‚Äôve considered and been fine with delaying college and a career in favor of a transition
- I prefer to play as a female character in any games I play, video games or tabletop

Reasons I‚Äôm not transgender 
- I‚Äôm don‚Äôt completely hate being a boy
- I don‚Äôt act very feminine 
- I hide my emotion 
- I‚Äôd be super ugly anyways
- I tried coming out to my parents and my mom thinks I‚Äôm sick in the head and confused
- It would cause more problems than I already have (expenses, family and friends leaving me, social ostracism)
- If I‚Äôm not 100% sure, I might regret transitioning and hate my life even more
- Potential (degenerate) fetishism that I‚Äôm not aware I have
- Religious upbringing that only confused me more about my sexuality and gender
- Putting off other life decisions to transition 
- I don‚Äôt know if I have dysphoria 
- Being refused housing or a job because of my state being ‚Äúred‚Äù
- I could get murdered if I don‚Äôt pass

I don't know what to do any more... Help sisters and brothers!,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

How to begin? 

&amp;#x200B;

For almost six months we have been together, grown close and love one another more than we have with anyone else, per our own accounts. He doesn't mind me being trans or if I detransitioned. However, he is no fan of neo-vaginas. He says they're not real vaginas, tech for trans people is in it's ""bronze age"", they typically do not look good compared to some real ones (from what he has seen and he says he has seen a lot) and that he's just opposed to it because of it. He is also opposed to marriage and involving the state, hating traditions and so on, expressing vehement dislike of it.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that in a relationship, compromise is necessary and that he is willing to compromise for some but not for everything, to go against all he believes in and that if I picked to have bottom surgery, which he sees as the body treating it like a wound, pleasure is severely reduced and that it's not a natural vagina, as well as he believes it does harm by the doctor and does not believe that is morally OK, to have me pick between getting bottom surgery or marriage, but not both.

&amp;#x200B;

I love him so much, but I want both, desperately and I don't know what to do. He said I could get the surgery, but that I shouldn't marry him then, but he'd stay with me, just not deal with the legality of marriage. I want the white dress, I want the ceremony, but I also want surgery. The balls get in the way, the dick is thick (I have a rather thick one according to him, above average) so it just gets in the way and I feel in order to transitions I have to go the full mile, and I want to. I want to feel more authentic and organic as much as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I don't hate him, but he thinks I'm mad. Truth be told, I simply don't know what to do. It's basically an ultimatum in my eyes. I fear if I get the surgery he will love me less, despite saying he wouldn't (he wouldn't want to screw me there nor would he like the appearance of it).

&amp;#x200B;

How do I handle this situation? I've spoke to him multiple times about it but I'm left with the two options. To me, it seems asinine and illogical since there are hundreds of things he disagrees with that I might agree with, so why treat it like a false dichotomy and compromise on those but nothing else? Please help me sisters and brothers. I truly need guidance on this. I don't want to lose him.

Thailand vs Home County(Netherlands) for GRS,"Hello everyone,

I already posted a facebook post in a local transgender group, but I'd figure I'd ask here as well.

  
So I got off the phone today with my insurance provider who said that as of 2018(so it can decrease on increase) that for my current naturapolis(insurance plan) I will only get covered ‚Ç¨ 10712.23 currently. If I were to change that however I could increase that up to ‚Ç¨ 14282,79(as of 2018) with a restitutiepolis(another insurance plan) in 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I considered going to Dr. Bank in Suporn's clinic in Thailand, but feared the difficulties it might bring.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand I also take into consideration the issues I may have in the Netherlands. That issue mainly being that a rapport shows that the need for a second recovering surgery is at a rate of 81%(21 out of 26 patients in their rapport).

I currently have about ‚Ç¨5200,- in savings so I am not sure if I can afford to even go with Dr. Bank.

  
As for where I live there are three surgeons I can go to. √ñzer, Buncamper and Boumann in rough order of overall experience. I'd get a regular penile inversion with extra skin likely from my testes due to me lacking material.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that also drives me crazy is the waiting list that I am currently in. Personally myself I don't deal well with not having exact information about when and where something will happen(probably because of my autism).  
Which also brings me to my point that there are very few examples of sugeries done over hear, which makes me distrustful of the whole affair over here

  
The pro's for me sticking to my home country are:

* Lower costs
* Closer to home for possible recovery surgeries
* A familiar environment.

The pro's for me going to Thailand would be:

* A *potentially* better surgery
* Clear dates
* Clear rough estimates of end result.

If you're over 18 years old and have had experience with chest binding, we would really appreciate seeing your response to the survey. 

&amp;#x200B;

The survey has been designed to build on the findings from existing research and hopes to discover:

\-What causes negative health outcomes associated with chest binding?

\-What are the community perceptions of safe and unsafe practices?

\-Does user behaviour have a connection to negative health outcomes?

&amp;#x200B;

We will be using this data and information gathered from other research procedures to develop methods of making chest binding safer. You can keep track of the progress of the project by viewing the project blog:

Am I a transgender?,"In short: Can I be a trans male if I was girly as a kid?

Lomg version:
Hello, and thank you for giving attention to my post. I'm someone who thinks oneself is a trans male. But for some reasons I wrote below, I simply can't be so sure.
When I was a kid, I was just like a normal girl. Played with both my dolls, and sometimes with cars. Usually wanted to be a princess or something, but also ran around saying ""I am the Lightning McQueen!"" and repaired the car with my father.

I remember, when I was like 4(it may be 3 or 5, I don't remember), we were going to park with my father, he was taking his shirt off and I wanted to do the same. He let me, so I did the same. When we go back to home, I told what we did to my mom happily, her expression changed. I asked if I did something wrong, she said no, hesitatingly. Of course, me as a kid had no idea why she act like that.

It was much before I knew what gender is, so not going to say that it was because I was a boy in soul. That's just a possibility.

I had long hair my entire life, and always liked it. I still like long hair, prefering to cut it short tho.
But when I cut it short when I was 3, I loved it too.

I was like that until I start going to school, doing what I feel like doing. But after I start going to school and see girls have to wear pink shirts and males has to wear blue, girls are being friends with girls and boys are with boys, and stuff like that, I started to fear being like a boy. Like, I was scared of wearing boy clothes or doing something boys do without knowing the reason. Only thing I know about gender was if someone says I'm alike with a boy, that can be my father, firend or a cartoon character, this is something bad and I should avoid this.
Now thinking about it, I was kinda jealous of boys. Like, I wanted to get treated like them but didn't know that(or maybe it's just me that making this up), wanted to play with the toys they do, but my best friend didn't want when I ask, so I didn't buy them.

Always forced and made myself believe that I like some boys, because all the Disney princesses had a prince, however I was just lying to myself.
At 3rd grade, our friendship with my old best friend died and we became friends with a boy. At 4th grade, we were sitting at the same desk, but even though we both were the smart students, we stopped to listening the lesson and begun to talk with each other all the day. Teacher thought we were dating and made me sit with another boy. Again with this boy, we were talking to each other all the day. As my other friend said, we were making too much noise.
Even after starting to middle school, we remained as good friends with the boy I started to talk at 3rd grade.

At that times my body started to change. My chest was no longer flat. I always hated the things that were growing there, always thought that was because I was growing faster than other girls but now I doubt that was the reason. I once squeezed them, asking 'why do you have to grow, can't you just go back in?' and since that day, they had something like scar on them.
I many times cried because I had them. Like, everytime I notice them. It was so rare that I was fine with my body.
Also until 5th grade, I was thinking if a girl and a boy spend so much time together, the girl with get pregnant, and my best friend was a boy. I told that fear of mine to my mother and she told me girls can't have a baby begore getting 'period', and even after that, you should have 'sex' to get pregnant. I was thinking it is something only dirty and bad people do until that day.
That was the day my fear of getting period has started. I always asked my mom ""I will not get it soon, right?"" and begun to pray for not getting it. I was thinking it would happen after years, and I would be ready for it when it happens. Tho I got it much sooner than I expect.

My mother was watching a movie and I wanted to join, it was about a girl who has a penis inside her body, and had to translation into a man to survive after she gaves birth to a baby. It put one more fear in my mind ""what if I'm like her?""

My mind was fighting with itself at that point. I didn't exactly know what a lesbian is, nor have feelings torwards a girl. But I was praying for being completely girl and not being a lesbian, and never getting period. Also was praying for my body to be normal and not over-grown. I didn't want to be a women, I was just a kid and wanted to stay as one. The idea of being something between a girl and a boy was just scaring me, I have a homophobic dad and for some reasons, thought LGBT was disgusting.

After a few months, I got it. It was going to be a long holiday, my father was coming home, I was playing with my new toys and nothing could be better. I was just happy. Then, I saw it as I go to toilet. There it was. I was just not believing. This wasn't happening, right? It was a dream, there was years for it to happen, or maybe wouldn't ever happen to me. I forced myself to cry, because it was something bad and shouldn't happen. Wanted to get my mom's attention so maybe she could do something. Maybe I could take hormones to stop it..
But in fact, I wasn't feeling sadness, I was just shocked. Like, I know, it's foolish that being so sad about it. But when I was 11, I couldn't believe it. It was end of the world for me. I was now a women, no return, everything has ended.

I forced my mom to go to doctor, but in the end I had to live with it. I was sad because of my body shape, but that one was unbelievable..


My childhood passed like that. And, I never feel completed. I always wanted to have lots of loys, dresses, extremely long hair, more than one of everything I have... I was always wanting more and wasn't feeling completed.

At the end of 6th grade, when I was still 11 years old and the perios wasn't regular, I met with a girl. She is even now my friend. She asked me to watch anime(Jaoanese cartoon), the series named Fullmetal Alchemist. It was when I understand being male is not a bad thing. Both females and males are human. Both have likes and dislikes, bith have personalities. Males weren't disgusting creatures. I had male friends. Were they disgusting? No. Were actors in Star Wars disgusting? No. Were, even though they are cartoon, this anime characters were disgusting
? No. 
I, to be honest, didn't ever see my classmates as males and females. Yes, they were girl or boy but all were just kids to me. I don't know why I thought being male is a bad thing.
My friend begun to say I am alike with a character. I liked the character so it wasn't bad to hear. However, I was a real human and he was just a cartoon character. I shouldn't be similar with something which doesn't exists.
I asked to my mom if I'm alike with that character. (Yes, I made her watch too.) she said ""No. You are a girl and he is a boy, you can't be alike even if you want."" that sentence of her was killing me. I didn't know why, just, it was making me extremely uncomfortable and even angry...

After a few months, I started to watch another anime. One character was saying ""She is talking like a boy."" for another. That made me extremely jealous, being alike with a male. Since then, I'm deepening my voice.

 I met with a trans boy(, at leats last time I see him, he was like that. Not sure if it was temporary). He wasn't disgusting from any angle. He was my friend and was a nice person. That way, I stopped to think LGBT is disgusting and became able to see how foolish I was thinking.

Meanwhile I was getting more tomboyish everyday. I was no longer able to stand wearing girl clothes. It was making me feel like sh*t. My hair was long but I was hiding it in my clothes.

Still remembering the first day I wear a male pyjama. I was feeling.. I don't know, maybe more completed? Just, that feeling was awesome.
It was not long before my 13th birthday, that I noticed that I was no longer able to myself as a girl. I was a boy, I was seeing myself as one. But I still didn't know how far translation can go, so my plan was getting the top surgery and there were some ways to stop getting period, doing one if them.
I was so happy and was feeling more like a boy everyday. I brought a binder, cut my hair short and people was now thinking I'm a boy. It was like a dream to come true..
I was still sometimes feeling bad for my body shape, and mostly for the thing that has the happen every single month. But when I don't have it, and had my binder on, I was most likely happy. I was no longer a girl in people's eyes.
Then I learned more about translation.

After a while, I made a social media account as a cis male. I was roleplaying.
However, after a few months of being happy, I saw a pitcure on my timeline, then the rest. It was anime porn, which we call hentai. It was also the first time I saw porn. Like, I basically knew how to do it but didn't ever see.

It made a depression begun. I was someone who rarely cries until that day, but since then, I got much more sensitive, about that gender subjects mostly.

When I see a flat person, a male, it makes me want to end everything. Not that I will, it just makes me feel like it. 

(By the way,I was thinking that depression is about to end but now seeing I'm much worse than before seeing it.)

Also, after seeing porn, I'm now doubting from my gender identity. I can't feel. Before it,I was seeing myself as a male but now I see it's too good to be real. Yes, even when I was happy, I wanted to be a cis boy and bit a transgender but now, I'm scared of these feelings of mine to be temporary, not being a transgender and have to live in that body of mine forever.

About a month ago,I got misgendered. I didn't understand that if I felt bad, but tears begun to flow down a while after and then I went to cut my hair, I wasn't cutting it in a while.


Sorry if that's confusing, I'm writing that for hours and most likely I didn't use proper English and made many typos.

Also thank you very much for reading until here. I would really be happy if someone can help. Ask me if there is anything that you can't understand.

"Having even more gender confusion (surprising, right)","(FtM)

This boy is asking me to go to a dance with him- that requires wearing a dress. I really, really don't want to wear a dress, but I want to go for him. I value him as a friend, and he's been asking me to go for the last 30 minutes. I don't think my parents would let me get a tuxedo last minute, either. 

I'm seriously questioning if I'm *actually* a boy right now because I was, well, feeling confident with a female body just earlier today. I'm seriously so confused right now. Sometimes I'm completely okay with being female, and I even *want* to be female, but other times, like the past few months, I've debated killing myself because I don't have a male body. 

And, no, I can't talk to a gender therapist because my parents won't let me. 

Should I just *try* to be female? I want to be a boy- I really do. I've been trying to convince everyone around me - friends, family, etc - that for the past 6 months. And then boom- suddenly today, after my therapist appointment, I start playing with the breast things and think I look cute. 

Maybe I'm just a masculine girl? But I want a penis. I don't want breasts. Usually. Sometimes I do want to look like a girl and be 'cute', but I usually want to be masculine looking, and be a boy.

Over the last year or so I‚Äôve had more and more thoughts of wishing I was born a girl. 

The problem is that my parents who are giving me a place to stay for free and helping pay my way through college are kind of conservative.

Laser hair removal and epilation for a hairy trans woman,"Hi. I came out to my parents recently, mom a few months ago and dad a few weeks ago. They said they're willing to help me pay for my treatments, which I told them includes laser hair removal since I have a hairy body and face. I'm apparently a good candidate for laser, as told to me by the laser technician who I had a consultation with today. Once I got to see the prices, it was apparent to me that we would not be able to do the full body laser treatment. Traditionally, I'd always shave my face and body. However, I just got tired of doing it and wanted something more permanent, to make me feel like a woman does, with less prickly and coarse hairs that a man has, especially for the face. 

My dad and mom said they're willing to pay for my face, which is $165 dollars per single treatment, using a Quanta laser. 

My questions:

1) Is a Quanta laser really the 'authentic' laser? My technician told me that IPL isn't actually a laser and that their laser they use at their clinic is the only one that can actually be called 'laser'.. I'd love to hear if this is true or not. They claim it yields better results.

2) is there a problem with doing laser for face right now, while using an epilator for my body, and having some similar results to laser for my body? The price for a single full body hair removal treatment is $2,100 or $9,200 for a package of eight treatments, and since we can't do that right now, I wanted to know if epilating my body would provide similar short term or long term results to laser.

3) Is starting laser at one place, then resuming treatments at a different place going to be okay? My family is considering moving soon and since I don't have a job yet (just graduated college) I would like to move with them, but it would suck if that harmed my laser treatments in some way.

4) I have heard that laser can be less effective once starting HRT because it thins and lightens the hairs. Should I put off HRT for this?

I'm hoping my body is receptive to HRT and that HRT can remove most of my body hairs, at least reducing them to that of which a biological lady has. Hopefully epilating and hrt will do the trick, but just curious on what you guys' take is on my approach. To me, my face is the most important aspect of my self confidence, and if I can get my facial hair removed permanently, I can deal with the rest via epilating or waxing or hrt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! Just needed to get these ideas out of my head, would love some advice or input based on your experiences with HRT, laser, and/or epilating. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. does epilation hurt super bad near the buttocks or genitals as it is made out to be? Kind of makes me nervous, but hell i'm willing to do anything to get rid of these hairs in some way that is better than shaving.. just seeing the prickly hairs poking out of my stomach/chest/legs makes me sick to my stomach.",asktransgender
"NYTimes - Intersex, and Erased Again","From: [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/opinion/trump-transgender-memo-intersex.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/opinion/trump-transgender-memo-intersex.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Where does the Trump administration‚Äôs broadside against transgender rights leave people like me?

Imagine knowing that every aspect of your physiology, from your height to your cup size, was chosen off a menu ‚Äî not by nature but by doctors and family members.

From the second I was born, decisions were made by medical professionals about which of two gender categories my body should fit into. For me, surgery to remove my gonads as an infant was the first stop on the track to female ‚Äî but the train didn‚Äôt stop there. My family was consulted about how 5 feet 8 inches seemed like an optimal height, and informed on how hormone levels and sequences could be measured to achieve just that. The ideal breast size for my frame was also discussed; I can still remember the male doctor nodding approvingly. I was also given a dilator before even hitting my teens, so my vagina would be ready for penetrative sex.

‚ÄúDisconcerting‚Äù would be one ‚Äî euphemistic ‚Äî way to put it.

I was born intersex, with XY chromosomes but Complete Androgen Insensitivity. If you‚Äôre not sure what that means, I don‚Äôt blame you. By some estimates, [almost 2 percent of the world‚Äôs population](https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/INTERSEX101.pdf) is intersex like me but is still living in the shadows because of societal stigma and shame. Stigma knows no borders, and neither did my body, apparently: I didn‚Äôt respond to androgen hormones in the womb, and thus stopped developing at a certain point ‚Äî a point between what we consider to be the binary sexes, hence ‚Äúintersex.‚Äù I was ultimately born with female anatomy on the outside but with internal testes instead of ovaries. As a result, doctors, alongside my parents, decided when I was still a baby that I would be raised as a girl. This decision has shaped the course of my entire life but was made without my consent.

Where would such a change leave me? My body would throw this Trumpian test for a loop ‚Äî my naturally occurring genitalia don‚Äôt match the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genetic code in this forced-binary paradigm that seeks to override biology.

Here‚Äôs another curveball: What Mr. Trump‚Äôs memo defines as ‚Äúunchangeable‚Äù is anything but. I know this because the process of realizing a gender via hormones and surgeries, analogous to the process the administration is seeking to marginalize and discourage among trans people, is one imposed on intersex children all the time ‚Äî but in our case, it‚Äôs done before we can understand or agree. It‚Äôs not just the government that is forcing an unnatural gender binary; medicine has been doing so for ages.

The gonadectomy surgery performed on my body was internal but opened the floodgates for a sequence of physical alterations that would affect my appearance and identity. Any subsequent decisions made about my body that involved me, at an age of informed consent, were constrained by this first choice: to render me traditionally female. Regardless of my liminal genetic code ‚Äî or rather, regarding it as a threat to societal norms ‚Äî the train to my idealized gender presentation had already left the station. Why were all these decisions fast-tracked onto my body? Not because they were medically necessary ‚Äî I would have been perfectly healthy just living and growing as little old me ‚Äî but because they were vital to ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù me.

The desire to force-fit people into societally conditioned boxes has led to sterilizing children and enacting medically unnecessary surgeries on them. These surgeries are irreversible, lead to physical and emotional scarring, and their subjects are un-consenting. They are, to put it bluntly, the coercive application of Western cultural ideals to everyday human bodies.

Now the Trump administration wants to make these ideals the official preferences of the state.

I‚Äôve experienced firsthand the consequences of the gender binary in what‚Äôs often a non-binary world. It isn‚Äôt good for anyone. Certainly not trans people, but also not for a population that‚Äôs larger than many think ‚Äî and that has spent years trying to convince people that our bodies are good enough as they are.

Even though the administration is calling for clearer lines, we can use this as an opportunity to explore the beauty of the blur. And while our current administration proactively works to enshrine a false binary in our laws, [we too can take action](http://4intersex.org/#_legislators) and give agency to those whose bodies don‚Äôt adhere to it. Until this point, we‚Äôve lived in a state of defense ‚Äî fielding constant assaults on our existence. This is our opportunity to mount a strong and overdue offense, rooted in love and understanding. One day, maybe soon, they will give up the game of trying to erase us.

I am confused,"Backstory

Since I was a kid I loved doing girly things and it made me and still makes me soooo happy to have this image of myself physically being a woman in my head. I don't know if I am trans or if I just am a feminine man, when I was 13 I attempted to try and tell my mom I was bi and she went behind me and told my dad so the next day I was lectured about how I am just too sensitive and its just me being a kid and it will change. My earliest memory of doing something feminine instead of just imagining it was painting my nails at age 10 (Which got me made fun of by my father when he found out) and I remember how happy that made me but again I don't know if its just me being a sensitive kid. I debated if I was trans at age 14 when I learned what transgender was because I live in Texas and in a very conservative area at that so I was never exposed to any of these things. Since then I have questioned it and always have the thought in the back of my mind and now that I'm 18 I still have this image of me being a woman in my head and it still just makes me feel amazing then I feel crushed when I open my eyes and see me as a male.

I am 6 foot 4 and wear a size 15 or 16 shoe I feel like even if I do end up seeing myself as trans that I would be held back by this.

I honestly don't know what my point of this post is I just want to end this confusion I have felt for so long it just keeps feeling worse at this point.

Also I went to a therapist at age 14 for some issues I was having and when I brought it up to her she supported it so much and was so happy for me telling her but since then she moved and I quit seeing any other therapists after the scolding I got from another one I tried after the original moved and since she moved I just haven't had any form of support at all on the subject.",asktransgender

"Dating, dysphoria and depression (NSFW-ish)","idk where to begin or if this is the right space to post.   I really don't know how to introduce this issue either. 

I'm in my 40s, haven't dated over a decade, and am losing all hope of ever finding someone for me.   Every trans person I know has a partner (if not several) and apart from the anxiety and depression many of us live with day to day they are doing ok for themselves with relationships.   Seeing that and knowing how difficult dating is for me is just killing me.  

My reluctance to dating I guess has a lot to do with body image/status.  I had orchy a long time ago but didn't have funds to do anything more.   Started HRT in my early 30s and don't have femme fat distribution, and like many of us have tiny titties.   The electrologist I used worked super aggressively and left me with noticeable pocking on parts of my face.   I used to have beautiful smooth facial skin.   I'm not ugly really, and am I guess relatively fit.   But like I am uncomfortable with how I look. 

I haven't had a nice time with another lady since before I fully transitioned.  I want to date again, but I can't bear the thought of being misgendered or being treated anything other than a lady when being intimate.   My existing nibbly bits still work, and I mean I guess I could enjoy having a nice time with the right person even down there.   Even tho I want the rest of the surgery, I can't afford it (even with insurance covering some of it).   

So I am stuck in dating purgatory.  I'm lesbian in that I don't like dudes, and am attracted to other women.   But then, like.. my body doesn't match what pretty much every lesbian (including many post-op lesbian trans women) expect or want.   If I date a lesbian then its gonna be a one-way thing with sexy time.   One acquaintance just flippantly said oh just get surgery then you'll feel better!     

Dating cis women is even riskier with being misgendered or treated in a not good way.   

On top of all that there just aren't as many gen x trans women.  I wouldn't date a boomer so I don't expect any mills to want to date me.

"If, overnight, technology for lab-grown fully-functional genitalia became available (and corresponding surgery became affordable), would women with penises and men with vaginas choose to stay that way? Why?","As a role-player, it has occured to me that common experiences of many, many transgender people that come with your genitals not matching your gender, like:

- having to tuck in your penis in your, err, secret tunnel,
- wearing a packer (or a sock),
- genital dysphoria impeding your ability to deal with your constant horniness due to second puberty,
- constant fear of being rejected by a romantic partner because of what's in your pants,

are due to a peculiar confluence of several factors:

1. ability to mass produce affordable hormones,
2. *juuuust* enough social acceptance that you can live in some parts of the world,
3. inability to grow body parts in lab (although the research was going strong a couple of years ago).

In other words, if we were slower on points 1. or 2., or faster on points 3., problems relating to having such a particular body type wouldn't exist, because nobody would have such a body type...

...or would they?

I know currently, in the real world, there a lot of transwomen/transmen that won't go with bottom surgery, because a neovagina/neopenis is not fully functional, and getting one carries a risk of nerve damage.

A realistic but hopeful assessment of current politics,"tl/dr; Trump is powerful but incompetent. Major policy changes are hard, and parts of the federal government are pushing back against the proposed changes affecting trans people. Trans people are running for office in larger numbers. People are becoming more accepting of trans people, and it is possible to persuade anti-trans people to become more accepting.

Trump controls the executive branch of the federal government. In theory, he doesn't make law, but in the process of implementing laws passed by Congress, the executive branch creates a lot of regulations that in effect are themselves laws. If Trump doesn't like a law, he can just fail to implement it in any effective way. If he doesn't think a law goes far enough, he can create regulations that push the law as far as it will go in the direction he wants. For the entire LGBTQ spectrum, having Trump as president is a problem.

However, the executive branch is huge, with a lot of different people who want different things and have different ideologies and loyalties. Trying to force the government's massive bureaucracies to make a major policy change is like trying to push a dead whale down the beach. That worked against trans people when Obama was creating more inclusive policies, but it benefits trans people as Trump tries to create more exclusionary policies.

Trump is basically incompetent. In order to implement policy changes, a president has to get his people into the high level policy positions in the federal government. We're two years into Trump's administration and hundreds of these positions still haven't been filled. He's terrible at negotiation; he's had several opportunities to make deals to get funding for his wall, and he hasn't done it. His administration completely botched hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico. The law and the courts give the president wide discretion in regulating immigration, but it took Trump three tries to get his immigration regulations past the courts.

My read on Trump is that he's pragmatically anti-trans. He doesn't personally care about trans people one way or the other, but he's happy to be anti-trans if it gives him some political advantage. Unlike the wall, which he is personally committed to, I don't think he's going to keep pushing hard on anti-trans regulations if he gets a lot of push back.

And there is push back, even inside his administration. The proposed regulations originated inside the Dept. of HHS, which was hoping for support from other departments. The DOJ deferred, which means they neither opposed nor supported them. The Sec of Education, Betsy DeVos, is mostly supportive of LGBTQ rights, and in this case is reportedly opposing the changes. There is also opposition within HHS. In reference to the proposed regulations, the head of the CDC said ""stigmatizing individuals is not in the interest of public health,"" and also said that he wasn't involved in creating the new policy. While he didn't directly criticize the regulations, to come out publicly against a policy supported by his bosses in HHS indicates strongly felt opposition.

Danica Roem is currently the only trans woman elected to a state legislature in the US. This election, there are ten trans people (both male and female) running at the state level. Not all of them will be elected, but several have a good shot. This may not seem like a lot of people, but it's a big change from just a few years ago when trans people didn't run for major political office. If trans people don't run, they can't get elected. Having trans people running is a big step forward.

According to a new BuzzFeed poll, half of millennials don't care about a political candidate's LGBTQ identity. That may seem kind of wishy-washy, but it's a lot of progress from a time not so long ago when being LGBTQ defined a candidate in voters' minds. On the question of whether trans rights are human rights, 45% of millennials said yes. That's a minority, which sucks, but it's progress. A few years ago many of these people wouldn't have known what trans rights are, much less been supportive. A small minority of women and Democrats in the millennial age group believed that trans rights are human rights, as opposed to only 34% of men. That suggests that as more women replace men in political office, there will be more support for trans rights. Similarly for Democrats replacing Republicans.

[A study released in 2016](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/220) showed that it is possible to counter transphobia. Quoting from the abstract:

&gt; Here, we show that a single approximately 10-minute conversation encouraging actively taking the perspective of others can markedly reduce prejudice for at least 3 months.

From an article in Vox describing the research, here's a description of one of the ten minute conversations:

&gt; ""I'm from South America, and in South America we don't like fags,"" he tells her.

&gt; This next moment is crucial: Virginia doesn't jump on Gustavo for the slur, and instead says, ""I'm gay,"" in a friendly manner. Gustavo doesn't recoil. Actually, he becomes more interested.

&gt; Gustavo and Virginia go on to discuss how much they love their partners, and how that love helps them overcome adversity. Gustavo tells Virginia that his wife is a disabled person. ""God gave me the ability to love a disabled person,"" he says, and that taking care of one another is why love matters.

&gt; ""That resonate a lots with me,"" Virginia responds. ""For me, these laws, and including transgender people are about that. They're about how we treat one another.""

&gt; Now that Gustavo is in a place where he's more open, Virginia asks him to imagine what the worst thing could happen if he used a bathroom with a transgender person. He admits he wouldn't be scared. Then comes the breakthrough.

&gt; ""Listen, probably I was mistaken,"" he says of his original position on trans rights.

This effect persists even when people are exposed to arguments opposed to trans rights. One of the researchers said it was as if the people in the experiment had been vaccinated against prejudice.

This technique is difficult to do. I don't believe there's any chance of an army of canvassers knocking on doors all across the USA and changing people's minds. But this offers something we all can do, trans and cis, to help promote trans rights. Listen to people, let them express their concerns and fears, then ask them to describe their own experience of discrimination, tell them about your own experience with discrimination, and then explain why you think trans people need laws and policies protecting them from this sort of discrimination.",asktransgender
About the recent political incidents against us... Thoughts on this?,"Preface edit: Trigger warning

  
A friend who I care for posted this, to protect their identity I'm simply copy-pasting this.

\* I called out RuPaul and Drag Queen Story Hour.

\* I called out early (and even non!) transitioners demanding access to women's spaces.

\* I called out the trans centers and clinics for rushing kids into treatment.

\* I called out the thin-air manifestation of 150+ genders.

\* I called out 'safe spaces' on college campuses.

\* I called out trans women competing in women's sports without a specialized physician's assessment of their hormonal and muscular condition.

\* I called out self-identification.

\* I even called out the sissy crossdresser takeover of FetLife.

\* I called out SO many questionable claims and moves by Gay, Inc. and Trans, Inc. and their followers that might alienate the entire rest of the population.

\* I said there'd be consequences if you didn't listen. Now you're looking at them. You've antagonized the right so badly for so long that they've gone nuclear.

[possibly triggering] Transitioning and genitalia for FTM,"This isn't a troll post, I would really like to ask this question and get honest replies. I think maybe this question might be triggering/harmful to some who are currently experiencing dysphoria. So please be aware and I am not trying to cause trouble or harm. 

I am AFAB. I am not trans (i don't think), although I was told something once that really restructured my perception about trans identity-- she said, transgender should be viewed as a train with multiple stops. Not everyone is going to get off at the same stop (surgery, full transition, etc). Some people are completely fine getting off at the stop that they are supposed to get off at. She said this because I was talking about some potentially gender dysphoric things and she said that it sounded like I was trans. I don't identify this way and I said that I don't think the label applies because it would basically be me stealing a label from people who are actually trans and actually struggling, but maybe what I feel does fall under the general umbrella. When I was young (around when ellen came out, so pre-mainstream-lgbt-acceptance), the term used was ""gender fucking"". I don't know if gender fucking is the same as trans identity though.

Anyway, my question is ultimately about penis. To put it quite bluntly, you can make an outie an innie, but you can't really make an innie an outie. I have felt ""right"" when I jokingly put fake dicks in my pants to see the bulge in the mirror, and it genuinely unsettled me enough where I haven't done it again. I don't know how much of how I felt growing up was because of absorbing misogyny. I like women (and men), wanted to be a boy, realized I couldn't ever have a dick that could penetrate. I also came to terms with my female form, more or less. The best way to describe where I am is that I wish I had both forms. I guess this ties into my bisexuality, a lot of men I am interested in, I sort of just want to take over their bodies and life. ""I am interested in you because I want your life"" sort of thing. Like stepping into a Gundam and piloting it, only it's my soul/brain. Like the movie Being John Malkovich. (but is it because of potential aspergers, ie: mimicking behavior) 

I don't necessarily feel like either, but is that simply because I do not necessarily fit into the standards of female gender roles? Then again, what the fuck are gender roles and why the fuck do we need them. I absolutely support demolishing gender expectations because what the literal fuck, gender expectations is arbitrarily assigned in the end and a human's brain and soul goes way beyond their outward appearance/physical form. Pronouns, again, completely arbitrary use of language. Physical form is fucking arbitrary. I would love to upload my consciousness into The Interwebs and live like that. (although this might have more to do with my probably being on the spectrum and seeing things a little differently/broadly/objectively/weirdly/whatever)

So I go back and forth. However because of having to defend against a lot of shitty asshole sexists (traditional, old-world sexism is just SO. KEWL.), I held harder onto my female form. Abandoning it would feel like giving in and ultimately declaring that being male is superior. Potentially though, this is what TERFs think? (I am assuming)

Sorry, my question here is how do you come to terms with the lack of penis? I guess I have internalized a lot of society's messages about sex and whatnot, so there are times that I feel incredibly inadequate or just .. lacking, less-than, etc .. because I cannot actually penetrate a woman. Is this simply toxic masculinity rearing it's head? The idea about penis size being a measure of a man's worth.

Then again, my inability to fully understand probably just means I am not really trans. But just because I can't fully understand doesn't mean I don't support those who are. Those who truly know who they are despite outward appearances absolutely should do what they must. But I think I have a lot of questions, and I do want to learn. I probably still have some toxicity inside of me but it's hard to suss out what is what, so I am posting on this subreddit. 

I apologize if anyone is super offended after reading this. That wasn't my intention. Also I think this post is kind of all over the place. Thank you.",asktransgender
How did you emotionally change when you transitioned?,"I'd like to have just been born a boy. I know I'd really love it if I look masculine, had a deeper voice, and was addressed as ""he"". Just a regular guy who acted like a guy. But  the whole coming out and transitioning process just seems like too much stuff to do. My mom would have a mental breakdown, my friends wouldn't look at me the same, not to mention surgery is expensive.

I just want all of this stuff to be worth it. I think about what I want to look like and how I wish people acted like I was a guy. I think, what if I do all this stuff but I still feel bad about how I am? What if I won't be satisfied with how I look still?

"To all my brothers and sisters who feel hopeless, please read my story. [Part 2]"," Heya, everyone!

This will be my second progress post since I began HRT back in mid 2016 \[[Here is the first](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5w2x9r/to_all_my_brothers_and_sisters_who_feel_hopeless/)\], and I just want to remind you all‚Ä¶ yes, you can do it.

TL;DR of the first post: I‚Äôm 193cm (6‚Äô4‚Äù) and 159kg (350 lbs), large build, large feet. Gave up on the idea of passing when I was 18 years old, but now that I‚Äôm 35 I‚Äôm -somewhat- passing and I can‚Äôt believe it!

I‚Äôve been on HRT for 2.5 years, and height and weight be damned, I‚Äôm blending 100% of the time now. I literally can not believe it. 2 years ago this was a pie in the sky dream, an impossibility, but it‚Äôs real‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs still very hard for me to accept, but I‚Äôm getting there. 

At first, I just chalked it up to people being polite because they see me dressed in feminine clothing, but I don‚Äôt think it would happen as often as it does if people were just being polite. There are -not- that many polite people in this world.

The three most recent slap to the face, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a woman, damn it! Accept it!‚Äô moments were:

First: I was in the restroom with a female coworker, a manager, and I mentioned something about being on HRT. She got a very confused look on her face for a moment, so I said ‚Äú‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm trans.‚Äù She said ‚ÄúOh, yeah! That‚Äôs right. I completely forgot.‚Äù

Second: Three new people got hired into my department at work, and it was my job to train them. I talk very openly about being trans because I just assume everyone can tell by looking at me, so once again, I mention something about being trans to the one young guy we hired. He said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre transgender?‚Äù I said something like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt tell by looking at me?‚Äù and he replied ‚ÄúI would have never thought so if you didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù

Last, and this just happened today: I was at a doctor to get some bloodwork done‚Ä¶ We were going over my medical history and current medications‚Ä¶ He asks ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Spironolactone for? To lower your blood pressure?‚Äù I replied with ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ uhm no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trans‚Äù And I don‚Äôt think it clicked at first because he says ‚ÄúOhh, okay. And the Estradiol? To boost your estrogen?‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúAlso because I‚Äôm trans. To give me estrogen period.‚Äù

I think that‚Äôs when it clicked, lol. He was like ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù and started asking me a bunch of questions related to that. He asked me if I was FtM, which was confusing and annoying, but at least he assumed I was AFAB?

The most validating thing for me was when he asked about my voice, because my voice is my biggest insecurity‚Ä¶ He said it was very feminine and asked what I had done to work on it, which was nothing more than just trying to emulate other women in my day to day life.

I dunno. It was all pretty validating in the end though. Gave me a big boost that I desperately needed after a shitty week!

But, like the title says‚Ä¶ Even when you feel like there‚Äôs no hope, don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never pass!‚Äù because you don‚Äôt know unless you do it.

TL;DR: Don‚Äôt give up. I gave up hope on passing/blending years ago, but it‚Äôs actually happening now. It can happen for you too!",asktransgender
A Brief Interaction," It's really hard to be an obviously transgender woman out in public. There are so many things that hurt: the stares, the whispering,  the misgendering. 

There's something else though, that really hurts me down to the core, but is so hard to explain. 

Monday night, some stranger (at a restaurant that I was picking up DoorDash for) pulls me aside to talk about how they don't understand why anyone has a problem with it (referring of course to my obviously trans self). People should be able to live their life, and they heard about the news and it terribly upset them. The host then comes up and hands the person their food and they say to the host, ""He was actually here first,"" pointing at me.

I don't even know. It makes me feel like I was just a box being checked off by this person. Like ""Showed I was an ally today"" or something. I would have liked an attempt at real human connection, but they reduced me to being transgender. And then still got it wrong. Like, sure they acknowledged me, but then they misgendered me in one breath.

Am I being underdosed? Is there anything I can do?,"I started full HRT (mtf) on boxing day of last year (Dec. 26 2017) so I've been on full HRT for about 10 months now, coming up on a year. At the start, I was on 200mg Spiro twice daily, and 4mg lupin estradiol once daily (This was supposed to be the final dose). I became rather annoyed at how cumbersome it was to carry around 2 seperate pill bottles, so I switched to patches in july of this year, and have been on 2 patches of 100 ¬µg estradot changed twice a week (on sunday afternoons and thursday mornings) since then. I also have 100mg Teva-Progesterone capsules but I haven't been using them at all because I don't quite understand how to use it or what ""Cycling"" progesterone is.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard of other people's HRT regimens and at full HRT they all range from 6mg-8mg estradiol once daily and 200mg spiro once daily, which seems completely different to mine. Am I being underdosed? Is this an abnormal regimen that my GP's given me?

As a side note, my breast development has basically completely stopped (This was the case before switching to patches) and I've noticed absolutely zero changes in my facial fat or fat anywhere else on my body (this might be because I'm malnourished and underweight though), my body hair growth is basically at the same rate as always, and my skin isn't that much smoother really. I hardly feel happy or feminine anymore despite feeling that way for the first 4 months of HRT. So that's not so great.

Also, how do I cycle progesterone and what difference does it make besides taking it with estrogen?

finally becoming who I've meant to be,"last three years have been hell for me but I've kept positive attitude about it all. started with surgeon messing up hernia operation by damaging nerves to the point I became disabled and no longer able to work , broke my ankle to the point I've had nine operations on it and now doctor says they have to operate on it again buy disconnecting ankle and starting all over to make it right. (which I need because I can't walk in heels , that part I didn't tell him)                The reason I'm here is to let it out that I have thought long and hard about where I am now and I have finally realized I don't have to hide who I am and want to be anymore . I am going ahead with MtF transitioning. I went to a psychologist just for backup in case my primary was to give me a hard time when I tell him I want to start hormones . I don't understand why people are so afraid to see a psychologist if you want to transition. She was great and just let me explain how I feel and how sure I am about my decision. She didn't disagree with me or try to talk me out of anything , she even gave me some references on who to see to make my transition so much easier than just trying to find out information on the internet. I hope this post isn't to long or boring to all of you out there. It just feels so liberating to finally do this and to make it public. Let people think what they want about me , I'm not going to worry about someone thinking I'm weird or anything like that . I'm just going to be who I should have been for all my life. I know the road ahead is a long hard one ,but I'm ready for any curve that comes my way. Thank you for reading and good luck to anyone thinking about transitioning , If it's what you really want than don't wait like I did. Just go ahead and be you!

Ideas on how to explore just how far this rainbow goes?,"Hey, um, this is my third attempt to write a post on this without it turning into a really lengthy rant. So, I've been out-to-myself-but-no-one-else for a few months, and started to see a therapist about ""all this junk"" and everything. My therapist thinks I'm funny, but I also told her I wanted to take things really slowly. 'We'll see,' she says, grinning. 

But, something has kind of been on my mind:

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you explore your gender? Or, more specifically, once you've decided you are 100% not cis, how do you secure yourself in either big box of ""binary"" or ""nonbinary?"" How do you decide where to settle down in the endless gender expanse?**

  
I feel like I cast off from shore, and as exciting as it is to get out of port, I've got no clue where I'm... going? 

Cute statements like ""if you think you're trans, you are"" only gets you so far. Plenty of people seem to have fairly specific ideas of who they are. That seems nice.

I don't have much privacy to explore ""womanness"" or how how well it suits me. And I'm perfectly willing to have an entirely unnecessary debate about how gender is a simultaneously meaningless and quintessential cultural concept; that being one gender or another honestly has nothing to do with clothes, or biology, or genitals, or personality, or tastes, or sex, or anything. And that *or anything* really gets me. Is it worth mentioning I did philosophy in college?

  
I'm in this massive pit of post-egg gender nihilism and I'm not sure how to climb out. It might be worse because I'm in that crowd of ""older and had a long life of being not blatantly dysphoric, except constantly anxious/depressed for no discernible reason."" All I know is... I'm really done with being a cis-dude. Whatever that even means.",asktransgender
I'm not a chaser but now everyone at work thinks I am.,"I work in a large, metropolitan city for an IT company. In my department, for those of us who are employed by the company and not contractors, we have significantly less turn over. Most contractors are only in on a project for a few weeks and then rotated out to work on other things. They're calling it ""Itemized Organic Growth""; how to maximize the efficiency of your work force by keeping things constantly fresh with new talent and utilizing them for their strongest suits in order to optimize performance.

Basically, ""let's fit these corporate buzzwords together and screw up everyone's project so no one can be held accountable for one thing.""

This is important because I recently became head of a 6 person team. A new contractor was rotated into our group. She is a transwoman, who we'll call Rhiannon, who recently transitioned. Unbeknownst to me, there were people in my group who knew Rhiannon as ""Ryan"" a few months earlier.

For whatever reason, Rhiannon was having a hard time adjusting to the groups dynamic. No one ever said anything transphobic or hurtful. Rhiannon just isn't interested in the hobbies and lives and others, which is totally OK. Despite a few bumps socially in the road, everyone got along. 

Her work is impressive and she knows more than me. I do not hesitate to commend her on her work and ask for her opinion when it comes to efficiency of coding, reworking code or deleting bloatcode from other programmers work.

So, one day before work starts, I walk into the break room and Rhiannon is pouring herself a cup of coffee. I say ""Good morning"" like any normal person does and she just sort of mumbles ""hey."" She's normally very assertive and smiles and carries a conversation, so I assume that maybe she's having a rough morning and try not to push it. Grabbing an orange juice from the fridge, I say, ""You look great. I hope you have a good day!""

She gives me the deepest stinkeye look you could possibly imagine.

""What do you mean I look great? Am I not supposed to look good because I'm a woman?!""

Wait, *what the fuck?*

I turn to her, totally caught off guard. ""I was just trying to brighten your day. I was being nice is all.""

She seethed, ""I don't *need* you or any other chaser to tell me I look great or have a good day.""

I was speechless. I didn't even think of her in any other way as a co-worker and I also didn't think it was appropriate as her co-worker and superior that I should discuss my sexual preferences in defense of not being a ""chaser."" So I simply said, ""I'm sorry"" and walked away before she could yell at me for apologizing. Somehow I felt that is where the conversation was going. I turn around and standing there are like 4 other people, not knowing what was happening and just staring at us. I was mortified and excused myself to my cubicle.

I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day. I kept wondering what I did. Did she resent me? Did it come off like I was trying to hit on her? Should I not take a personal interest in my employees?

I've never said a bad word about her. I've never discussed her ""passing"" or done anything inappropriate and now there's rumors going around saying I was trying to come on to her and corner her when she was alone.

Granted, I rarely have dated anyone from work and I date all sorts. Men, Women, Tall, Short, Fat, Thin, All Races, whatever; basically if you have a great personality and your interesting, then I want to get to know you because I believe that personal interaction with people helps to grow one's world and mindset. I don't ""chase"" any one or fetishize their existence. It hurt me deeply to think that someone could think that of me.

I am afraid this is going to poison my reputation at the company. I don't want to talk to her alone and I don't know how to fix this awkwardness. Someone please help me understand, what did I do wrong?

tl;dr: New transwoman at work thinks I hit on her, yelled at me in front of others and is now trying to label *me* as some sort of malicious chaser and I have no idea how to handle it.

Edit: Thank you for the honest responses. I really appreciate the candid answers. I will email her and apologize.

Also, TIL, I shouldn't try to connect with or make people feel better if I sense something is wrong because no matter the intent, I will trigger their insecurities. I won't reach out in anyway because I'll fuck it up.",asktransgender
I want a FTM top surgery but I‚Äôm cis female,"So I don‚Äôt know much about the inter workings of the trans community and I have questions regarding my desire to have a top surgery even though I‚Äôm not trying to transition ftm. 

BACKGROUND INFO:
To start, I don‚Äôt want kids so having breasts is basically pointless. They just get in the way, bring me pain, and I want them gone. I‚Äôve considered breast reductions but again, why even keep them around at all when I don‚Äôt want them at all? For a while I thought what I wanted was a double mastectomy but then I saw what the results of that procedure look like and I was like ‚Äúheck no!‚Äù Double mastectomies make your chest look like a hack job. So that‚Äôs when I realized that what I wanted was pretty much a ftm top surgery. 

QUESTIONS:
‚Ä¢Does this mean I have dysphoria? I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not gender dysphoric cause I love being female. I just kinda think of my reasonings for wanting top surgery are much like the reasons someone would get braces on their teeth or laser eye surgery. Is it like, body dysphoria or something? Or do I just not know basically anything about dysphoria? It‚Äôs all confusing and I feel like I should have an answer for these questions if I want to get the surgery because‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢‚Ä¶I know alot of top surgery doctors will require a letter of recommendation for the surgery from a therapist regarding feelings of dysphoria or one‚Äôs feelings towards being binary male. If I‚Äôm not trans male or dysphoric like I think I am, what am I supposed to do if I want to get this surgery? Are there well trained doctors who will do the surgery without a letter from a therapist? If so, please send me some recommendations. Preferably for doctors in the southeastern United States area.

‚Ä¢how do I approach the topic of telling my parents that I want this surgery? I know I‚Äôve mentioned to my mom that I may want a breast reduction but we only talked about it once and that was 9 months ago. She wasn‚Äôt wholeheartedly opposed to the procedure, but she did say she wanted me to wait a while and try other methods before I paid thousands of dollars for surgery. Totally understandable. It‚Äôs just that now I‚Äôve upped the ante and want to get my breasts completely removed and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her. She and my dad aren‚Äôt super pumped with me, as they put it, ‚Äútrying to be different.‚Äù They‚Äôve gotten a bit better recently but still. This isn‚Äôt like dying my hair or putting a slit in my eyebrow or dressing emo. This is a big surgery and I just feel like they‚Äôre not going to even give the thought a chance

intense questioning phase with no strong conviction,"Heads up this is just a brain dump with a tldr on the bottom. 

Hey all I‚Äôve been going through a period of intense thought about gender and sexuality. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist to talk about my life and when I lay out my thoughts it‚Äôs shocking to me how egg like I seem. I used to cross dress and have sex with people but now I sometimes wear women‚Äôs outfits and hang out in my home. I routinely wear women‚Äôs shoes, shirts, and hoodies since they fit me better (i‚Äôm short and skinny). I spend a lot of time imagining life as a woman but i‚Äôm not sure if this is just a phase or some manifestation of a kink. 

I‚Äôve put in a huge amount of effort into improving my life and i‚Äôm very happy with where i am. I‚Äôm successful in my career, have a good social life, and am in a happy relationship with a cis female. Sometimes i feel like something is missing but i might just be guilty of experiencing grass is greener syndrome. 

My gf knows i used to cross dress, and I have shown her pictures. We were playing around in bed recently and she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a good girl‚Äù i was confused and repeated it back to her and the said it again. I wasn‚Äôt sure what that was meant to be so I ignored it. That thought really scared me though since my gf is straight and our romantic relationship would probably end if i were to transition. 

When i was a teen i went through something similar and researched transitioning but i got busy and then stopped giving it much thought. I never was comfortable enough to explore gender and sexuality until about a year ago. 

tldr: been going through a long period of questioning. signs seem to indicate i‚Äôm not cis but i‚Äôm not strongly convinced. ",asktransgender
Alarming increase in promoting violence.,"News of the government's policies towards us are terrible, and must be met strongly with our voices and our votes.

Worse, it plays into the hands of those we oppose.  They want a fight.  They want to make us look bad.  They would love nothing more than a reason to kill us in self defense. 

Everyone should be keenly aware of how much manipulation is coming from overseas.  They want to spread discord and chaos.  We are smarter than this, why fall for it?

Dealing with the inability to become pregnant,"Before I started hrt, I felt vaguely sad that I didnt have the possibility of becoming pregnant, but I was ok with being the mom of my partners child, assuming they have a womb. I just kinda thought, in a lesbian relationship, theres usually one that gets pregnant and one who doesnt, and ill just be the one that doesnt.

Since ive started hrt, that really changed. I feel so much more intensely and clearly that I really wish I could be pregnant. Because its practically an impossibility, I try to just not think about it too much. The fact that I considered the matter 'solved' pre-hrt helped me pretend nothing had changed.

But things have changed. And I have no idea how to really deal with this. With all my other important sources of dysforia I can fix it, but its unlikely ill ever be able to get pregnant myself.

Not really sure what I am,"Damn I can't even figure out how to write this. I don't know what is important information and what would just be me babbling. I am concerned that this will just end up me rambling so TLDR down below. However I also do really want some advice so I want to explain the situation. Shuting up now.

Essentially I was assigned male at birth and that has been fine for the most part. I have always had some internal problems with myself and being a man, long before I ever really knew about any of this. I always wondered what it was supposed to be like to feel like a man, and never felt like I did, like I missed the memo. People talk about things like ""manly pride"" and all that crap and it just has never made sense to me. Just always wrote most of that off as just, the general uncertainty of life I guess? Like oh well I am just over thinking this so stop worrying about it. 

Skip forward to the recent past and essentially i started learning more about all of this. I became friends with a trans girl and wanted to educate myself more on the subject so I started looking into things. That and just hearing parts of her life, well it resonated with me and I began questioning. Insert egg cracking sound effects. I looked back and started rembering how I have sort of been wondering about this subject all my life. I remember times when the same friend had talked with me, asked for my opinion and advice on something as a ""man."" Well I did not really feel comfortable speaking for men. Biggest thing that came up from all this questioning was something that I did as I kid which I had forgotten about until now. I recall dressing up in my sisters clothes when no one was around and feeling this strange wonderful energy, but I was so afraid that anyone would find out. Eventually I stopped and forgot all about it.

So here I am now and just don't know shit. I have been thinking on the subject, wondering what do I think I am or what would be most comfortable being. But I don't know. Am I a man and I am just over thinking it? Am I woman but have some ingrained societal whatever so I can't get comfortable with the concept? Something in between? Agender and that is why I can't really get comfortable with identifying as anything? I just don't know. I feel uncomfortable no matter what situation I imagine or what I imagine being. So I guess to finally get to what this is all about, what should I do to move forward and figure shit out? Any and all advice would be appreciated. I have been wondering about simply looking for a gender therapist to talk to about this all with, but was not sure if that was right or premature or what have you. Thanks in advance!

"Slightly awkward question about surgery, circumcision, and 'bend'.","[lots of anatomy stuff incoming]

So I'm 17, coming out of my egg slowly but surely. And basically, I won't beat around the bush: I've got a problem with my dick called a chordee- makes it bend downwards. Too much to be useful. Now, I'm scheduled to consult on surgery for it soon (the surgery itself hasn't been scheduled, though). The planned surgery involves a circumcision, and then sorta placing a 'stitch' that pinches the tissue and corrects the bend.

My question is- since I originally consulted on this long before my egg started to crack- how exactly might this affect the possibility of future SRS? I know that having the foreskin tissue is supposed to be useful, especially since I'm kinda small when not erect. Is it worth having this brief surgery anyway, or holding off? (Or should I ask a surgeon about this, perhaps?)

It gets slightly more complicated. I have not, to my knowledge, ever really experienced significant genital dysphoria. However, I'm completely pre-everything, and I understand that this can increase over time as transition continues. So I don't wanna botch my chances now if it becomes a desperate need. On the other hand, though- I'd really like to *use* this thing at least once if I'm possibly gonna get rid of it one day. Already had one partner where penetration was sadly not an option because of this, and since SRS/developing the desire for SRS can take a looooong time to happen, I don't wanna keep doing that for another few years or so.

"Meanwhile, life goes on","So, this has been a really discouraging week, news-wise. And a lot of us are justifiably upset. For a little perspective, I'd like to just share my own little bit of news. I started a new job on Monday! I had been considering how to go about coming out at work when I was laid off a month ago. So I just took it as a chance to be me. Full time. I get gendered female most of the time by strangers. Not because I pass, which I don't. But I think I come off as ""AMAB woman"", as opposed to ""man in a dress"". None of my IDs have been updated, but only HR knows that. I interviewed at a lot of places over the phone, via video, and in-person. There was a somewhat different balance of questions than I'm used to, but I was never treated badly by anyone. I had 2nd and 3rd interviews at several places. I can confidently say that being trans and presenting female didn't make my job search any harder. And since I started at work everyone has been nice, everyone is gendering me correctly, and no one has tried to tell me I'm using the wrong bathroom. This is all happening in the Dallas area.

I'm sharing this story because it's a big deal for me and you all will understand that. But I'm also doing it to offer some perspective on things. I'm angry and scared about Trump just as much as everyone, but I'm not letting it interfere with my life. I'm immeasurably happier than I was before transition. My only regret is *still* that I didn't start sooner. But the reason I waited was fear. 10 months ago this situation would have pressed every button I had to keep me too afraid to even consider transition. And that would have been a tragedy. Even if all the doomsday scenarios actually do come to pass, I'm still better off than I was. And we're all better off than we were even just a few years ago.

I'm sorry if this violates the rules, but I was wondering if anybody has experience with this. How hard are they to get? How bad are the legal repercussions if caught?",asktransgender

Dysphoria cycle?,"Anyone else cycle in and out of dysphoria/obsessing over trans stuff? Is there a predictable pattern to it?

I was super busy and distracted last week and managed to not think too much about gender stuff for the first time in months. The whole trans thing started to feel like an embarrassing memory, like, ""Did I seriously manage to convince myself I was trans? The fuck??"". 

Then my binder came in the mail. I like it. I can finally kind of picture myself as an androgynous guy. 

I also randomly discovered a new singer who's kind of transition goals for me. Seeing guys I envy is probably my biggest trigger. It makes me feel a weird mix of euphoria and dysphoria.

Now I'm feeling the most intense dysphoria of my life, less than a week after feeling like I'd made it all up. My dysphoria's always been pretty mild up until now, so I'm freaking out a bit.

Anyone else cycle like this? Any advice?",asktransgender

IM Injections: injecting quickly but worried about hitting bone,"So I do IM injections in my thigh, and I was of course trained to use the quick, firm motion. But on occasion, I‚Äôve hit what *feels* like it‚Äôs be bone (stops the needle in its tracks, area hurts way more than usual and leaves a bruise. I‚Äôm skinny af, so it seems likely that the needle could reach the bone).

I‚Äôm kinda paranoid about jamming the needle in now and started slowing down, but now it gets stuck at what I *think* is the muscle and it gets hard to push it in after having stopped at the edge.

So two questions:
1. Any other skinny people have bone trouble (assuming that‚Äôs what it really is)? Any advice for extra measures to make sure I can‚Äôt hit it?
2. If I stop at the edge of the muscle ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm going too slow, is it ok to pull the needle back just a touch and then press it back in? Or do I need to start over at that point?

Thanks in advance!",asktransgender
I haven't had surgery but how do I tell my dad I'm not actually Trans*.,"So I'm 14 year old female, I use to think I was female to male. This happened when I was 11-13, I thought that because like male clothes, like short hair, me being uncomfortable in my body, and being all around masculine meant I was Trans\* (I still cringe thinking about this). I came out to my Dad and Mom (My mom isn't part of life anymore, not because I came out) about a year ago. They we're understanding and my dad knew but really didn't like talking about it (I am the youngest, I was the ""daddy's girl"") he never really said ""she"" then he just sorta called me by name (I was born with a gender neutral name). I never came out to anyone else mostly because after I came out to my parents I had doubts if I was actually Trans\*. Everyone just assumed I was a lesbian (which I now know I am) I went along with it.

After Starting High School I finally came to the point where I want to continue to live as a girl and I now know I'm not Trans\*. I want to regrow my hair out and get some more feminine clothes, but I still have to tell my Dad and Therapist I'm not Trans\*. I don't know how to word it, I feel like a failure and that I dis-credit actual Transgender people. I hate myself for coming out and I don't know how to fix this,",asktransgender
I think my mom has tried to supress my transness my entire life.,"So I came out to my mom 4 months ago, and she has only been unsupportive and directly deny it and not wanting to use my new name or pronouns. I do own a lot of girls clothing witch I really want to wear all the time. But my mom has guilt tripped me hardcore telling me what if the neighbours see it (I live in a small area, and know them) and tell everyone? How would you be treated? And many other degogotary things while always misgendering me even when I try to correct her, she denies it saying im a ‚Äúman‚Äù now.

But I recently got thinking together with a friend about how she must have reacted eariler in life about this, and I realize she might have activly and deliberatly tried to shame me out of it all my life. It was so early as when I was 4 or 5 years old, I had taken her lipstick and used it on myself. I dont remember anything from that age, but I have a picture of it on the big harddrive of all the pictures they took of me as young. She has never talked about it to me. Later date when I was in primary school I was bullied but she did not want me to move school, it was so bad. If I knew what suicide was, id fucking done it. But my mom did not belive me, she never does. She always thinks she knows whats better for me. So she didnt belive me when I said I cried on school and in class. Untill my dad came to school and saw I wasnt joking. But they did not change anything at home, life continued as usual even after that. Not even allowed to change school.

My mom also always told me what clothes I could buy and couldnt buy, and often guilted me for picking out girly clothes, which has now made me extremely anxious about even going by womens stores (I have cry at the mall its that bad). And it often ended with her picking out clothing for me and me saying yes even though I didnt like them.

At 14/15 I wanted to shave my legs as it had begun to grow and I hated it so much. But then my mom did a full on lecture on how wrong of me as a man it was to do that. And how everyone would begin to bully me again for it if they found out if I even wanted to do it. So I kept my mouth shut in panic never saying it again, living in pain seeing myself grow body hair. Dreaming of litterly getting a knife and cutting all my skin off, but my mom didnt listen to me.

Trough all of the middle school I always loved looking at the girls, but when boys commented how sexy their boobs and ass was I was so dumbfounded they were looking at that? I was always so fasinated by the clothes and hair. I broke completely down one day realizing I would never ever be able to wear thoose nice clothes (I did not know that trans was a thing). And my mom told me she owned a thights and that (as I loved the look). So then started a cycle where I would wear her tights at home alone day in and out. Every day was go home wear tights before others came home. This lasted for a solid year, every day was wearing thights day.

She has done a lot more, but theese are the first ones I can think of, but there is one more thing iwe always dreamed of was to run away. Every single day on primary, middle and now high school I litterly dream of jumping out my window and running away. I dont want to be here, and realize now that im 18 I can accualy do it. But as im apparently helpless I get so undecisive about doing any decicions as I always go to my mom first and ask her if its okay or tell her about it before I do it to see how she reacts. I have never thought about myself for my entire life, and im only now just beginning to realize how bad that is. I have never been myself, nor tried to. Iwe suppressed it extremely hard. Just to give you an idea, I only realized I had favorite colors only 2 months ago. Before I always just said I didnt have any. Its really depressing everything and I dont really know what to do forwards as HRT in Norway is espessaly hard to get and my body is just getting worse and worse.

My mom is also very controlling to this day, constantly sending me SMS if iwe eaten breakfast, lunch. If I have done homework, that I need to sleep or not sleep, and much much more. Everything I do HAS to go trough her, if I do something without her knowledge she gets super panicy and tells me how bad it is and how if I got in trouble she wouldnt know how to help me and such. Its such a fucking horrible mess and I hate my mom for all of this. I just want to get away but I dont know if I should. When I told my mom I wanted to move out she said no, and how it was a bad idea and a waste of money. And all of the sudden wanted me to redesign my room. And she would pay for everything, so I can get anything I want for my room as long as it is not like 1000$ of dollars. But I dont think she is doing it to be kind, as its very out of her doing and I am really dumbfounded of why she all of the sudden just lets me do so much for free. I have to pay for my own subscriptions online such as Spotify and other services, my own phone and computer and all other utilities similar to this. And I do not have a job, so I got a shitty half broken Oneplus phone now and spendt all my money on building a computer against my parrents will, they were so against it and I postponed it for many years. Its shitty. This is getting rather venty but im just so pissed at them how they are, and now that I have told them they are trying to be all nice and such. I feel like they are trying to build up something to guilt me into staying with them as I really feel like they would be angry at me moving when they just renovated my room and how mean I was to them for doing it and such. And as im helpless it will seriously mess with me if they did that. I would prob break down and end up staying home. 

Also I am suicidal, and have contacted every possible suicide hotline, without any results. Been to my doctors and told her, she didnt do much but send me out again. And my therapist didnt belive me to be ‚Äúa person who would end my own life‚Äù. My therapist also doesnt belive me about anything, and I have stopped going to him. He was so bad for me. And still trying to recover from that mess. And my mom litterly doesnt belive me when I say I want to end my own life, she just says to me to not say things like that. Every time. She doesnt reassure me or say anything. Just tells me to not say it. So I have kept silent about it for a long time, so long I dont know how long other than id say most my life.

Any ideas how to solve or better my situation would be great. Im 18, live in Norway .",asktransgender

When you run into your old coach but now you're transitioned,"So for my electrolysis for GCS, I have to travel. On my way home sometimes I stop at a restaurant in the town I grew up in to grab a bite to eat.

Tonight I had to wait for what I ordered. There was only one other person sitting there. It was my basketball coach from when I was in Grammar School. (I'm 45 now)

There were skeletons setup where he was sitting. I broke the ice and made a joke about the ""lousy service"".

Then I said - hey you're ""John Smith"" aren't you? (I knew damn well it was him).  He said yes. I said - you coached my brother's basketball team (my ""brother"" being me, of course). He said maybe what's your brother's name? I gave him my deadname. He knew exactly who I was talking about and got excited - saying how great that team was (we were undefeated). We chatted for a bit - and then my food was ready. As I was leaving he said - Do you still talk to your brother?  I said - yes we're very close (hard to keep a straight face at this point). He said - please tell him I said hello. I said - of course, I'm sure he'd say the same to you.

I wasn't sure if I should say hello but I am glad I did. I wish in could have been honest because he was such a nice guy - then and now - but that would have been an entirely different conversation.

"I promise I‚Äôm asking this in good faith: How, in your mind, is being trans different from identifying with gender stereotypes of the opposite sex?","As a cis(mostly)het man, I always assumed this was just something I wouldn‚Äôt ever understand. And maybe that‚Äôs the answer? 

What differentiates between, for example, a man that likes stereotypically female things like wearing dresses, makeup, pink, etc, and a man that wants to transition into being a woman because they like the same things?

Is this just something that I‚Äôm not really meant to get? I feel like the only reason I feel like I‚Äôm a man IS my sex, and if I were born with female genitalia I would probably also be comfortable being a woman (although maybe that‚Äôs just me and probably isn‚Äôt universal, I‚Äôm pretty feminine in a lot of respects).

By: George Godwyn

Something happened on Facebook awhile ago that I‚Äôve never written about and only shared with a few people. I kept it to myself, mostly, because I didn‚Äôt want to upset the people in question, but I guess it‚Äôs time. (And for probably the first time I am going to put a content warning on a post, because this post probably requires one. So, here's a CW for violence against trans people.)

For a long time, I wondered about the understanding of gender on the far right, the Trump right. The bathroom controversy, in particular I thought bizarre. I can understand the basic conservatism and fear of new ideas, but the bathroom conflict seemed odd to me. It was extremely important in the minds of Trump supporters, even though it can‚Äôt possibly be a common problem in most of the areas these people live. The position on the right seemed precisely the opposite of what it should be. Why do you want someone presenting as a woman in every respect using the damn men‚Äôs room, or vice versa? Isn‚Äôt that going to be more socially outrageous, in most situations? I didn‚Äôt get it. So I decided to ask the Trump supporters.

I posted a picture of Buck Angel, a transgender adult film actor, in a few of large, sometimes huge, Trump groups. The picture showed a very buff, ripped Mr. Angel from the waist up, shirtless, with a shaved head and sporting a Fu Manchu mustache. He is an extremely masculine looking guy. With the picture I included the question ‚ÄúThis person has a vagina. Which bathroom should they use?‚Äù

I thought at least some of these people will realize how silly it would be to want this man to use the ladies room. How socially awkward and alarming that would be, in so many situations. Putting aside how dangerous it would be for the man, simply on the basis of the the immediate, practical effect on the other diners in the given Applebee‚Äôs or wherever it was happening.

The post got hundreds of comments, finally thousands. Immediately. The Trump supporters had a very clear answer and they were adamant about it. Almost no answered with ‚Äúthe men‚Äôs room‚Äù. A few said things like ‚Äúif they‚Äôve got a vagina, they use a woman‚Äôs room, if they have a penis, they use the men‚Äôs room.‚Äù But the majority of the of the commenters had an answer I hadn‚Äôt considered at all. These people had worked out a very simple solution to the problem of transgender people and the norms revolving public restrooms.

They wanted transgender people to die.

They were quite explicit about it, very blunt. ‚ÄúThey should die.‚Äù That simple. That concise. ‚ÄúThey should die.‚Äù

Let me be entirely clear about this ‚Äì they knew what they were saying, they knew exactly what they wanted. They didn't want a trans man in the men's room and they didn't want a trans man in the woman's room. They wanted the trans man to be dead.

Of course some of them were more loquacious than that. They had reasons they should die, preferred methods, they expressed their feelings about the fantasized the deaths, but death or something similar was the most common answer. ""Stop being"", essentially. A lot of other people answered ‚Äúthey should stay home‚Äù, maintaining the status quo without having to deal with the problem while still allowing transgender people to, you know, live, but mostly death or some sort of violence was the preferred option. Comment after comment, they should die, fuck them, stay-at-home, don‚Äôt use the bathroom, I‚Äôll kill them if I catch them in the bathroom with my daughter, they should die, they should die, they should die.

Oh, and in case That's not plain enough, it wasn‚Äôt just death they were threatening. They were threatening anything they could think of. Torture, castration, humiliation, at adults and children alike. Any brutal, vicious insult or threat imaginable. I‚Äôve watched these groups for years, dozens of them. Anyone who watches the news, who‚Äôs seen our president make a speech, knows how mean, how grotesque, how petty and ugly these people can be. The things they say about Mexicans, Muslims, about women, gay people, immigrant children. Even if you haven‚Äôt been in one of these groups, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine. Jesus, our president publicly mocked a disabled man. But I still wasn‚Äôt prepared for the comments in this thread. Just sheer, stark, gut level hatred, unencumbered by the slightest empathy. Loathing. Disgust. Raw hate.

As much time as I‚Äôve spent in these groups, examining these people, I didn‚Äôt think anything could shock me. I was wrong. Maybe it shouldn‚Äôt have, but it did.

There is not one single issue that brings the evil out in Trump supporters the way trans-people do, there is no class of people more loathed. More than anything else, gender self-determination symbolizes precisely the social progress that animates the Trump right. They despise it and the people who embody it. Understand this. This issue is central to these people on the right, there is nothing they feel more deeply about. The Trump right does not want a solution to the social problem of trans people and restroom use. They simply do not want trans people to exist. That is what they want. What they demand. Nonexistence.

Today the New York Times reported that the Trump administration is now in the process of redefining the administrative understanding of gender as simply a matter of biology and nothing more. Gender would be determined solely and entirely by birth assignment ‚Äì as male or female, immutable and unchangeable, a fact. They are already rolling back numerous civil rights guarantees instantiated in the Obama years, policies that allowed a significant portion of our nation to live their lives with some basic dignity and safety. Essentially the Department of Health and Human Services intends to define transgender people out of existence.

This is happening now. Right now.

Like I said at the beginning, I never really talked about that little test I did in the Trump groups with Buck Angel‚Äôs picture much before this. I know so many trans people and I know how difficult it can be for them, sometimes, just to live their lives, what a scary place the world can be. I felt like it was all too awful, I didn‚Äôt want to scare people even more. I guess it probably wouldn‚Äôt come as a shock to most of my trans friends, it‚Äôs a reality they live every day, but I just didn‚Äôt want to pile on. But it's too late for all that now.

I haven‚Äôt heard people talking about the Health and Human Services attack on trans rights all that much, so far, and I‚Äôm a little surprised, because we should all be clear about something. The changes they are making don‚Äôt mean a little inconvenience for a few trans people.

They mean death. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs going to mean withdrawal, seclusion, humiliation, violence and death.

Think about the Trump supporters I described, think about the thousands of comments I just told you about. Now think about the reinforcement this sort of decision makes for their worst instincts, think about a trans man, presenting as a man, being forced to use the ladies room in some Podunk, red state, Trump voting shithole.

Now how do you suppose that goes down with the rest of the folks in the having dinner? And how do you suppose the teenage trans boy using the ladies room goes down with the parents of the teenage girls at the high school? And how does that make the teenage trans boy feel? Or the teenage trans girl having to share a bathroom with the testosterone jacked 17-year-old jocks at the high school? And what do you suppose happens to the trans girl forced to onto a man‚Äôs prison block?

Humiliation, violence, rape, suicide, and murder. Death. Trans rights are a matter of life and death, in a very real, very palpable way. The definitions change, and people die. The rules change, and people die. The laws change, and people die. Immediately.

This is happening because the people in the White House get it. They know their base, and they know exactly what their base wants. They got it 100% right this time. They are defining transgender people out of existence because they know their base wants transgender people to be dead.

Trans rights, opposition to gender self-determination, hatred for trans people, as I‚Äôve already described, are at the heart of the Trump phenomena. There is nothing that evokes the hatred and fear and violence on the right the way the simple existence of trans people does. It is stomach turning to see, horrible in its blind ferocity, and I don‚Äôt know how the fuck my trans friends have the strength and poise to live every day in the face of that horror, that hatred, but they do. I suppose they have to, and that‚Äôs where the fight is now.

I don‚Äôt care who you are, I don‚Äôt care where you are in the political spectrum, I don‚Äôt care how fucking liberal or leftist you are, I don‚Äôt care how feminist you are, if you don‚Äôt support trans-rights, you are not on my fucking side. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your bio‚Äìessentialist arguments, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your history with men, I don't care about your pissing eight year old or your bigot grandmother. Frankly, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about your traumatic sexual assault if it means you‚Äôre going to take it out on some fucking teenage girl who doesn‚Äôt want to have to use a bathroom with a bunch of frat boys and have the same fucking thing happen to her. Fuck you.

If you want to know where the battle lines are drawn most clearly and unmistakably, between decency and the dark, right now, in the United States, in 2018, it‚Äôs here. Trans rights are the battlefield and trans people, like it or not, are in the vanguard of that battle. They are the front-line in a fight they never asked for, every fucking day, every hour, every time they leave the fucking house.

There is no fight more important as this, now, today. There are no people so vulnerable, so marginalized and there should be no fucking doubt among anyone on the left, any liberal, any libertarian, about this.

The fight is here now, it‚Äôs happening. An entire marginalized community, federally defined out of existence and set up to be victimized by a segment of the population too fucking backwards and just plain, willfully dumb to bother to try and understand what the hell is going on in the world, or empathize with another fucking human being.

If we don‚Äôt stop this, people are going to die, killed for something they can‚Äôt change, for who they are in the deepest part of themselves. Not somewhere down the road, not in five years, but now. They‚Äôre going to start dying now.

We can‚Äôt let that happen. Those of us who still live in the modern world still own this culture and we need to do what we can to make sure it doesn't. We cannot go back to the 1950s, we cannot watch more people die simply for being born a woman or a man. We cannot let that happen. We can't lose this battle.

This isn't temporary, this isn't going to go away tomorrow, the last two years is only the beginning. Gender self-determination will be the civil rights battle of the 21st century. If we have to fight this for the rest of our lives, we cannot allow these fuckers, this raw hate, to win.

So be shocked for a second, cry about it for a minute, and while you're at it, maybe today is a good day to hug your trans friends, tell them you got their back. Because we do, a lot of us. America isn‚Äôt just Trump supporters. Remember that, guys and gals. For what it‚Äôs worth, some of us got your back.

Then get over it and get ready, because this is a fight and you're in it. We all are, all of us, left, liberal, libertarian, right, if you're a decent human being and you care about basic human rights, you're in it up to your ass and the water is rising fast.

Hatred is a powerful emotion and it is temporarily ascendant, but hate can't beat the future, and that future is an America, a world, where every single trans person lives their life safely and with the same dignity any other man or woman enjoys, because ultimately, as badly as they want to, they just can't turn back the clock. Not when so many of us stand in their way, not with so many lives on the line. They just can't.

And that really is immutable, unchangeable. That really is a fact.

How do I get my parents to stop holding on to the last visible bits of the gender I was assigned at birth,"I (17 FTM) cracked my egg about 6 years ago and have been presenting in an increasingly masculine way ever since. Currently I am generally passable, though whenever I do something even remotely feminine, my parents make an extraordinarily big deal about it. For example, when I got my senior photos taken for school, the only one my mom ordered was where I looked more androgynous. They have been aware of my gender nonconformity for a long time so I find it especially surprising that they still have this habit even after directly told them I plan on fully transitioning months ago. I have had conversations with my mom about avoiding referring to me in feminine ways (since she wont use my correct name and pronouns) and she seemed like she got the theory but then told me I needed to try and understand her reluctance since ""I was her daughter for almost 18 years"". Both I and my gender therapist have tried to tell them how stressful it is to be socialized as female and i'm just not sure what to do at this point.",asktransgender
I think I have a 'crush',"I'm in serious shit. 

I've never actually had a 'crush' before. Sure, I've thought some people were cute, sure, but I don't think it's been like this. If you haven't seen my spam posts, let me get you up to date. I'm bisexual and questioning my gender. I refer to myself fully as male right now, though I prefer to say I'm just questioning. 

Like I said before, I'm in some shit here. There's this boy, and I know he's had a crush on me before, as I've known him for like 3 years, but I don't know about now. I haven't come out to him (or to any of my friends outside of my bff). The reason I'm so stressed out about this is, well, because he's cis, straight(I think), and probably transphobic. A large part of me really - *really* \- wants to try a relationship with him, but my dumb ass gender issues are fucking it up, as usual.  Another part of me suggests that maybe I could stay female for him, but would it be worth it? 

I know this sub isn't for me to ask for relationship advice, but please, I really need it.

Stress reactions after transition,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed that the way my body reacted to stress has changed over the course of my medical and social transition.  My methods of coping did not help me anymore the way they used to. The limits of my physical and mental performance have changed as well.  Extensive stress now causes physical symptoms like being constantly short of breath, dizziness , nausea and even fever.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to raise awareness that your health is important and that you should look out for new ways of dealing with your body during the transition. Allow yourself some time to accomodate for changes and adapt to new limits. Overdoing can cause real lasting harm like damaging your memory and focus, making your immune system weaker and so on.

Looking for friends in Greece,"I know this might come off as weird (or maybe it's only me who thinks that, who knows).

It's just that i think it'd be somehow easier if I were to attempt to express my feelings in Greek rather than English, but then again I'm rather hopeless with that sort of thing. At this point I don't have anyone with whom I can talk freely (I'd probably get immediately disowned if I came out to them - and my brother just doesn't give a shit) and I guess that's what I'm trying to do.

Cost of a Planned Parenthood appointment + labwork?,"On my 18th bday, I plan on my gift to myself as starting HRT.

Also, I am afraid that in the future my dad will find out that I am on HRT and take me off his insurance. Can I even make the appointment if I am not 18 yet as long as it falls on or after my 18th birthday?

Getting Trans Services?,"Hi everyone. This is my third post here and hopefully will be one of the last as I'm really close to entering the beginning steps of my physical transition. I've found a place in the Los Angeles that offers trans services and know what I'm looking for in terms of my identity. However, with there being so many facets to transitioning, I find myself struggling to verbalize what I need help with. I've been staring at a phone number to a clinic for what seems like a lifetime, unsure of what to tell and what not to tell whoever answers that phone at the front desk. My current goal in my transition is to start HRT and get my head together. I've been looking to start forever but an incredibly strong force has been seemingly stopping me at every turn. 

I feel as if I'm asking a dumb question, but how do I tell this clinic that I need their help and what information is relevant to them when I call for their  services? What do I need to bring? I would appreciate if people tell me their experiences with the medical side of transitioning and how they got into appointments. I guess I'm asking this out of fear that I won't go through the process correctly and then get denied or something. Anything you can tell me to make this process easier will be greatly appreciated.

Question about Scarlett Johansson and Rub &amp; Tug?,"So after reading the comments here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9r40ty/scarlett_johansson_turned_down_film_funding_from/?sort=top

I do have a few questions about it. Even though most of the comments were a shit show, some people did bring up the argument that the film won't be made and if it did it would get less exposure?

I saw someone bring up the counter argument that at the very least it should have being played by a man, and forgive me for paraphrasing cause I can't find the exact quote, but the argument would arise it would just be seen as someone wearing a dress instead of the actual cause. But I think the argument was made for the Danish Girl, sorry don't know the plot of either films.

I saw other arguments applying this more broadly, like daniel day lewis playing someone with Cerebral palsy
 in My Left Foot, although that's a problematic example.

Any articles explaining my questions would be fine and greatly appreciated!

I'm finally opening up.,"Alright, this is going to be a long post. I just wanted to get people's opinion on this before going to a professional about anything.

I was born a female.
Ever since I can remember, I've always wanted to be a boy. As a child I was often confused for being a boy as well. I disliked most things ""girly"" and stuck to my naturally boyish interests (I don't know if this is important or not, but I found it easier to befriend boys than girls as well).

However, I was a very quiet child when it came to this, I didn't tell anyone about it.
I didn't explore why I may feel this way, I just internalized the feeling without thinking about it.

Just to give you an idea of the situation, both my parents are and were emotionally and mentally abusive. Sometimes it would turn into physical abuse. Especially with my mother when I was young.

Both of my parents were both strict on ideals and what life they wanted me to lead, so as I grew up, I wanted to be that to please them. Anything that maybe didn't fit what they wanted that I was feeling, I quickly dismissed.

Through my preteen/teen years I still felt the same desire to be a male. As I grew up, I wondered if this could me possibly having signs of gender dysphoria, but I quickly dismissed any further thoughts and pushed my feelings further away. In my mind, I was going to marry a boy, have a family, and do everything else to keep them happy.

In this time (and anytime, really), when needing to dress up, I always wanted to dress more masculine than I did. I was very uncomfortable with my forming female parts, and still am uncomfortable with them.

A lot in my life changed when I met the woman I'm with now. We've both helped each other a great amount. We've been together for three years, and while watching some heavy gender topic videos, I fully opened up to her about what I feel deep down. I want to be male. I'm very uncomfortable with my body for a number of reasons, and I believe the gender issue is a part of that. When I imagine myself becoming a male, it makes me feel genuinely happy. Since opening up to her about this, it feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

I have depression, and since explaining all this to her and my desires, it has seemed to improve it a little bit. I feel like a major part of my life that I have been neglecting is now able to be fully explored. This being said, I'm feeling a lot of confusion and frustration as this is all being let out. This is where my question comes in.

If I haven't explained enough above, or with what I'm going to say yet, please ask any questions you have.

My body is biologically female, therefore when people ask, I tell them I am a girl. But in my mind, I feel like a boy. I can cope with the way things are now, but it's still nagging. Late at night I stay up deeply wishing I could just wake up as a boy. I want there to be a day where I can be kne, and called one as well. I wish I could be more open with my feelings beyond my girlfriend, but I don't think the others in our life would understand. I have researched a bit the process of transitioning too, just for the record...

Now, here is the conclusion and question.

I'm not a professional.

I am not going to claim what I am feeling is definitely a form of gender dysphoria.

My question to you is, based on what I've said, do you think it is or could possibly be that? If not, what do you think it is, and what steps should I take next as I try to embrace this side of my life that I have been trying to suppress for so many years?

Also, if I have said anything offensive or phrased something wrong, I apologize. Please let me know and I will fix it. Otherwise thank you for your time, your thoughts will be much appreciated if you decide to comment.",asktransgender

"Extremely worried, is this something I can go to the ER for?","I admit that I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac, and this might sound like I'm crazy or jumping to extreme conclusions about an extremely rare condition that I might not have. But too many coincidences are adding up for me to ignore them as just my imagination.

In May I started getting shortness of breath, along with excessive sweating. I have no idea if it's related to HRT or not, but anyway, I've been to the ER 3 times already this year for this and they did a bunch of tests. It wasn't a heart issue, or a blood clot, or any of those typical major things they test for. So we never found out what it was. Some people including my parents tell me it could be anxiety, but I know for a fact it's not - it's something physical, because 1. it gets worse when I lay down and, immediately better if I get up and 2. It happens immediately on any kind of exertion, but even just walking at a slow pace. I used to walk upwards of 10 miles at a brisk pace before May without this problem. Also, I sweat even in cooler places when no one else is, especially right after eating, but it can happen anytime.

I could deal with this and just learn to live with it. But I've been noticing a huge amount of other, and for me far more worrying symptoms, that kind of made me realize this past week what it \*could\* have been this whole time: acromegaly. I really hope I'm wrong because this is probably one of the worst possible (outside of very life-threatening) conditions to get as a trans woman - enlarged brow/jaw, loss of roundness in face, deeper voice, thick/oily skin, increased hair growth. It's caused by too much GH (Growth Hormone) and not T. I don't think it's a T issue anyway, since every time I've had it tested my T has been almost zero, and I haven't changed my doses around at all.

What really hinted me towards this is the rapid masculinization I seem to be having, most noticeable the past two months. It's especially noticeable since I've never had any of these things before up until now:

\- Ridge starting to form on eyebrows. Or what I assume is a ridge. It feels like bone and they're two bumps a tiny bit above where each of my eyebrows are. My forehead feels like it's sticking out a bit more in general.

\- I can't tell from much whether my jaw has changed, but I noticed starting the past couple days that I suddenly have jaw pain, which just adds to my worry and confirmation on this...

\- Face looks really square now rather than oval/round like I've always had. After looking at pictures, especially from May when the shortness of breath started happening, I realize my face and neck are way thinner, which is odd since my weight is exactly the same as then.

\- This one really worries me the most: starting about a week ago I am just not able to use my female voice at all without it sounding hoarse and messy. Prior to this I had (at least what I thought) was a relatively natural female voice, with minimal effort. I don't have this problem when I use my ""male"" voice, which is not really deep, but I worry that this is the start of that.

\- Related to that I guess is that my adam's apple (and whatever that bone is below it) are actually sticking out now. It's not too noticeable but I can't ever remember a time when I could actually feel/see them. It's especially noticeable when shaving - my neck is a bumpy/bony mess now.

\- My shoes are getting harder and harder to get on.

\- This one isn't really masculinization, but I realized just how much I'm eating when I really count calories, and it's upwards of 4,000-5,000 calories a day. I don't exercise at all since the shortness of breath started and I've been exactly the same weight (within a pound or two) these past 5-6 months. I know that sweating and body heat in general are related to metabolism, and this + increased appetite happen to be other symptoms of acromegaly.

\- It's hard to tell if it's thicker, but my skin is definitely oily to the point where if I touch it with my hand it's greasy all over, unlike being extremely dry like before this all started.

\- Shortness of breath, and especially excessive sweating are both common symptoms in acromegaly and I feel like this makes sense as to why they didn't find it, as they generally don't do these tests at an ER (and I didn't mention or realize the other bone etc. changes then.)

So I'm not sure what to do because I can't see any of my doctors until at least the end of November, but possibly not until January next year (I'm in college currently with no transportation.) And I doubt that I can just go to the ER and tell them I'm having these symptoms of a really rare condition that I might or might not have, added to the fact that I've been there 3 times already this year.

I feel like if I wait any longer this is going to progress into more and more permanent changes. I had such a good start transition-wise with puberty not doing much damage, and I don't know why this is happening to me \*now\* at 27... but it's really destroying any motivation and positiveness I had. Especially due to the fact that I just started living full-time in July and started my first semester of college this year, this is practically the worst possible timing for all of this to start happening. I actually felt like I passed a few months ago when I started, but I'm getting more and more stares it seems like, especially this past month. The changes have not been too severe yet, but I feel less and less like a woman every day. I literally can't keep my mind on anything else, and I WANT to think that these all either have other explanations or that it's just my anxiety. But adding up everything that's happening it seems more and more obvious to me that this isn't just a nightmare that I'm imagining.",asktransgender

I never thought it would happen, and I still don't believe it - but I want to hear from people who have been lucky enough to hit this tipping point. Note: I haven't really been trying to present feminine, for reasons of personal safety. 

Just to list a few: 

 - Met a new neighbor (F) who works in a similar place as me. She immediately struck up a conversation about gender balance in the workplace, and seemed a little put-off when I gave her my deadname. 
 - Had a queer friend tell me they initially thought I was FtM. 
 - Spotted a dude at the gym watching me work out, from the floor above, leaned over the railings. I saw him, did a double take, and stared at him. He gave me an embarrassed half-wave, and backed off from the railing. I kept staring - he gave another small half-wave and ducked out the door. 

Vaguer thoughts: 

 - Small talk in the elevator is getting more stilted with men and more personal with women. This might just be my own shifting demeanor. 
 - People treating me a little differently at work, lately. Not a specific experience, difficult to put a finger on. 
 - A friend found a near perfect voice match for me with a cis woman. Like, we sound dead ass identical. It's uncanny. (I've also been told I sound like Cecil from Nightvale, so you never know.)
 - No one as of yet has explicitly called me a woman, in person, but I also live in a liberal state where I don't really expect to be sirred/ma'amed in my day to day life.

How to get over forced fem/rape fetish as ftm?,"I‚Äôve always been very masochistic but after I was fucked without my permission this summer I‚Äôve developed a ‚Äúfetish‚Äù where I pretend to be a girl and force myself to use my female parts. Honestly before last year I was genital dysphoric and had penetrated myself like twice ever and didn‚Äôt like it. I absolutely hate this fetish and feel so ashamed and disgusted by it. I think it‚Äôs making me more depressed and I feel like I just get in daily cycles of being dysphoric over something then getting horny and making myself dysphoric then masturbating, then getting horny whenever I think about it next. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Also I have a therapist but there‚Äôs NO way at all I could bring this up to anyone irl. If they didn‚Äôt already not take me seriously as a guy, then they certainly won‚Äôt take me seriously after I said that.",asktransgender
How do you deal with parents not accepting you being trans?,"I'm a 28y old trans guy pre-HRT. Since I got my first GIC appointment, I finally decided to tell my parents about it. I called them (I live in a different country) told them how I felt and asked them to use my preferred pronouns and my chosen name. They responded with things like 'you're not a guy' 'you were born a girl so you're a girl' 'there's nothing masculine in you' 'if you feel like a guy it means you're a girl, because feelings are for girls' and so on. On top of that they said that they fully accept it, they just don't think I'm a guy.

Fuck logic, eh?

I gave them a week or so to digest the information and made another call yesterday. My Mother used exclusively female pronouns and kept on repeating my deadname (which is weird, because my entire life my family called me by my nickname - Junior. Since I told them I'm trans, they suddenly stopped calling me that and use my deadname exclusively). When I politely asked her to at least try to use male pronouns she got aggressive and told me she knows perfectly well what pronouns she should use.  

They keep on saying that they accept me, but I just don't see it. They don't even try to make me feel accepted and seem to believe that if they say they accept it, it's the truth. I feel pretty bummed out, because I just don't know how to cope with this. I'm making my last stand in writing them a letter on how I feel. I've always had problems with expressing my feeling to them, because I'm afraid of them. Every serious conversation ends with me feeling cornered by them, what makes me lose my point. That's why I've decided to put what I feel on paper. 

I know I can just stop talking to them, since I'm not dependent on them at all. But it feels wrong to just turn my back on my parents. Do you guys have any advice on what should I do?",asktransgender

Why isn't gender dysphoria considered a mental illness?,"I know that being transgender is not a mental illness, but what about dysphoria by itself? From what I've read and heard (I've never met or talked to a trans person so I may be ignorant), dysphoria can make people feel immensely uncomfortable in their own bodies. unchecked it can lead to things like depression, drug addiction and even suicide. So my question is, why isn't dysphoria considered a mental illness? Is it a matter of stigma?",asktransgender

You know how they say your brain snuffs out the bad memories? I suppose that might be the case for me. Only, every memory is an unwanted one.

I'm winded. Mentally and physically. I wake up, force myself through the painful trepidation of the day to come (sometimes by laughing, most times by crying), go through my classes, come home, and sleep. I really, really like sleep. It lets me forget. 

I don't deserve personhood. Sure, I live and breathe - but I don't really exist. I stick to the sidelines. It's easier. No one has to look at me, or speak with me, or judge me. I don't have to have a personality. When I'm a girl, I tell myself, I'll get one. In the meantime, I don't want it. But the chances are slim.

To the point of detransition or suicide,"Sorry for my long post, but if I don't go through the entire story, it'll be out of context.

I've been dealing with dysphoria my entire life. I started coming out when I was 16, but then I was out one night with friends when I was 18 and got raped and beaten. I crossdressed at home, with the help of a supportive wife, until I was 30. At that point, I couldn't take it anymore and I transitioned. I started taking Estrogen and Spironolactone at 31. We had two daughters and everything seemed like it was okay. But at 34, I got very suicidal for other reasons (marriage was falling apart, my business failed, I was in a shitty job). Eventually my wife left me and over the last three years, we have been actively engaged in custody/visitation. I'm still under psychiatric care and recently been doing better - but not great.

But over the last seven years, I haven't had \*any\* body changes. I don't feel like I fit in with any other trans people. Okay, to be honest, I don't feel like I fit in with any group of people - never really have my entire life. I have lots of acquaintances, but only a few people I would consider friends. I also have borderline personality disorder, which factors into the loneliness factor.

I can't even look at selfies from trans people any more because it just depresses me. I suck at makeup, and as a software engineer who works at home, really don't see much point in doing it daily. I like the thought of wearing dresses and skirts, but then feel stupid when I wear them. I feel like a fraud if I call myself a woman.

All the fighting with my ex, being lonely as hell, being broke, and the dysphoria just makes me want to give up entirely. Of course, I can't really talk to anyone I know about this, they just kind of blow me off. I've even been yelled at for sharing my feelings on my personal Facebook feed - ""people don't want to hear about your suicidal thoughts"" someone said.

I'm thinking I just stand in front of a train and let it take care of me.",asktransgender
Ochiectomy vs SRS,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here and currently I'm really torn on the decision between SRS and the orchiectomy. I was wondering if you guys could maybe give some pros and cons for each, I personally only have cons for SRS right now

SRSCons

\-The surgery is pretty much a gamble- Dilating (lifelong)- hairy vagina- A lot of nasty complications- Loss of libido

Orchiectomy

Pros- My dysphoria would disappear since its mainly caused by the testicles- No longer T blockers- Overall feeling better

Cons- Bulge might still be visible when wearing tight clothes (really unwanted)- Loss of libido (potentially)  


Edit: Also what I'm interested in is if the hair follicles get removed with orchiectomy as well.",asktransgender
Advice on writing a trans character?,"Hello, I wanted to write a trans character but I'm not sure if I should or not. I am a cis female and I was just looking for advice on this topic, and any relevant links or things I can research before I get too into it. I wasn't sure if this is something I should attempt or not, and if there are any things to avoid.

Basically I wanted to do a comic, it's sort of about childhood friends reconnecting. I wanted to have a transguy, and I have been looking up different things and other people's experiences and trying to understand it all, so I can make an actual realistic character. I've only really done some rough sketches so far and a basic outline, but I don't know. I've never met a trans person in real life, and I'm not certain if I can portray one realistically. I have a bunch of different questions I've been trying to look up. I'm also not sure how in depth I should go into things, because I am cis maybe I can't do something totally authentic, but I still want to try?

Do any of you have any kind of advice for this type of thing? I hope I am not being offensive in any way, and I would like to create something respectful, I just want to know how to do it, and in your opinion whether I should or not?

Could I be transgender?,"Hi all, for a while now, one way or another, I've asked myself this question. Ever since I first saw mention of genderswapping in fiction I latched onto the idea. I often fantasize about being a girl and all that could bring. I've even created an alternate girl me that I like to write through sometimes. In games it's hard for me to play a male character (not really comfortable with it unless I design a copy of myself) but even then it's difficult to play as such for long and actually get into it. I also do a bit of hobby writing in my spare time and it's the same deal for my protagonists. 

If I had the choice now to just suddenly switch I know I'd do it without hesitation, but despite that I feel fairly content with how I am. There was a time that I shaved (and shave I had to being primarily of French, Italian, and Hungarian descent) but gave that up as I knew it was as futile as trying to shovel a driveway in a snowstorm. I have been growing my head hair out (which I'm proud of how long and soft it is when treated right!) and if I worked out I could be handsome enough, but it just doesn't seem worth it. 

I don't have a problem with my‚Ä¶‚Äúequipment‚Äù and don't really feel that they're wrong, but I also know that I'd be perfectly okay without them. I figure that no matter what physical gender I am I'd be fine, but I also wish I had the frame and looks to even attempt to pull off trying a cute skirt or wear a pair of pumps. 

I know I should probably talk to a professional about all this, but I was also hoping that those that actually have definitive experience with these kinds of things may be able to help me sort out wether I might actually be transgendered or if I'm just fantasizing. 

I appreciate any and all input that may help me with this. Thank you!",asktransgender

What is the importance of Rhetoric vs. Unity of voice in our community?,"This is a somewhat meta discussion that I'd like to address, if the mods are willing of course.  

So I have noticed a significant portion of the argument and tension in this sub and other trans spaces in reddit be be derived from a difference in opinion regarding delivery of message. 

As a single example, but keeping in mind there are plenty more: This issue with the federal government potentially trying to redefine  'gender' and the affect of that decision being very bad for our community. The idea that such a change would be damaging to the civil rights of trans persons in America is fairly ubiquitous however, _how_ an argument/action against that notion is presented or taken seems to generate tension, despite our general unity. Some people have responded with a sense of urgency, in some cases drastic urgency. They have pointed out a trend that they feel, or that they view is growing more and more volatile and in their opinion will lead to significant increased violence against trans people. Meanwhile others have stuck to a message of preserverance and what I call 'quiet defiance'. These people propose that the numbers of people who are violently against trans people is disingenuous, and is artificially swollen due to the loudness of their toxicity and how it is represented online. I personally believe that both of these approaches are valid, and each has a place at the table. Each method can aid the movement in the right circumstances and either can generate a positive reaction from both trans and cis people. I don't think that one is right and the other wrong. 

And yet: many people in one camp choose to attack the methods of those in the other camp. For example on a recent post the OP was advocating for drastic measures for self preservation in response to a rising tide of violent extremists in America that creates an unsafe environment for us. OP was accosted for fearmongering and inciting panic. 

I have a concern about that; here we observe two individuals who both seek the same goal: to spread knowledge and information about Trans people, ensure that trans people are afforded with the same human rights as a cis gendered person, and to generally dissuade hate speech and discrimination while ensuring the safety of trans people during the process of change. 

They have different methods of getting there, and instead of focusing on accomplishing their shared goal through the different methods that they have, they take to bickering with one another in an attempt to 'correct' each other. 

I propose that we as a community agree to disagree on methods in most cases, and push forward in accomplishment of our goals.

Understand, Different messages are going to reach different people, and to suggest that only one style of rhetoric will be effective is lunacy. The end goal is the same, and we should focus on rallying around that unified voice, and allow different methods their chance to put their contributions into the bucket, sort of like departments in a vast organization.

Got my first taste of harassment today. I feel like shit.,"So I have been going regularly to this gym for a few years now, and am pretty friendly with the staff and a few of the regulars. I have been on feminizing hrt for 4 months, but still present as male when I go there.

I usually go during the afternoon when it's practically empty, but ended up going in the evening since I was having a stressful night and needed to vent. After doing my usual workout for 30 mins, I go to use one of the weight machines, next to which two women are standing. I hear them mutter something while looking at me and giggle, then one of them looks at me directly and yells 'FAG!', and they both burst out laughing. Being the spineless person I am, I ignored them, finished my set, left the gym and cried in my car.

This has made me reevaluate transitioning because I know this is basically nothing compared to the abuse other transpeople get on a daily basis. In all honesty I'm not sure I have the mental strength to put up with this kinda stuff. Does it ever get easier to deal with?

injection question,"I'm going to preface this with, I think I'm going to talk to my doctor about it too.
So, about 2 months ago, I was injecting estradiol valerate, the way I was told to, how I was told to, where I was told to and using the specific amount I was told to. I ended up calling 911 because when I was injecting, I found more than usual pain, I pulled out the needle slowly and blood squirted across the room. I managed to stop the bleeding, but since then I've been absolutely terrified of injecting, and attempts tonight ended with bleeding a larger than usual, but not overly worrying amount, which does not help my fear. I managed to inject .05ml before needing to take it out for fear that even though I asparated, the pain was getting worse, so I had to take it out. Does anyone have any suggestions on this? How can I get over this? is my body trying to tell me to go back on pills? Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you.

I had no problem with it for over a year and a half before I had this happen.
I ended up taking some older pills that I have still for just incase measures, and I'll probably take those for a couple days while my leg heals up from the injection attempts, and call my doctor tomorrow.

"Um a litle help, please... Trying to explain to someone that it's not a choice to be transgender. Went badly...","I were just trying to explain to someone in the YouTube comment section why being transgender is not a choice. But I have learning disabilities, ADHD and Aspergers. I may sometimes use a poor word choice, or say things in a way that other find disrespectful. I don't mean any disrespect or harm though. But I guess in some cases I have difficulties with knowing when I say inappropriate things. But after many years with my ""Chronic fatigue syndrome"" diagnosis, I also have big problems with forming sentences and I often lose words. I feel like a person who have had a stroke and no longer am able to express, convey what they feel or want to say. And sometimes it just turns out badly because I don't know how to explain myself. This conversation with ""that person"" just made me confused üò® 

 Is it I who struggle to understand something here, or is this person just blinded by their opinion of transgender people, and am simply just unable to understand me?!

(Sorry, I did get a little bit frustrated when I tried to explain it to ""that person"". Maybe I should have said things in a better way.)

&amp;#x200B;

**That person:** ""First...Trans is a choice. When you decide to live in the role of a different gender...that is a choice. NOW, I find it crazy that this President included this group when he started running for office,and now doing everything to disenfranchise them. YOU can now make the CHOICE to put someone in that will include you.  CHOOSE.Ôªø""

**Me:** ""Being transgender is not a choice! I wish everyday I didn't have to deal with the dysphoria. Do you really think that dysphoria is something that you choose?! If you're perfectly happy and feel 100% comfortable with the gender assigned to you at birth and about the body you were born with, would you choose to live as the opposite sex? Does that make any sense to you?? 

 If it were you, could you choose right now to feel physically and psychologically uncomfortable with the gender assigned to you, and your biological body? Could you switch on a dysphoria switch? Would you be able to go on hormones and have a sex reassignment surgery even though you're perfectly fine with how you were born? If being transgender is a choice, then that means that everyone including you should be able to choose to be transgender, and to medically and surgically transition like it were no big deal. If YOU, can't choose to be transgender, then how on earth would it be a choice for someone who is transgender...  Transgender people who do choose to transition only do that because there's no other choice for them. There's either having to live a life in pure misery with the body you were born with, or transition!Ôªø""

**That person:**  ""You cant blame folks for your choices.  I don‚Äôt. My choice is to refuse to believe that I was created to be a black Male. That‚Äôs what I have to LEARN to accept and live that truth. God designs us for purpose. I choose to support those who decide to live alternative lives. Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree. Whatever promotes peace and harmony. I‚Äôm for that.Ôªø""

**Me:** ""  What I'm trying to say is that being transgender is not a choice. I didn't choose to have dysphoria. When the dysphoria came, there was nothing I could have done to prevent it. It's like when someone for example get cancer, the cancer can come whether you want it to or not. Not trying to compare cancer to gender dysphoria, just using it as an example on how it's not a choice.  

Gender related dysphoria is the feeling that something is wrong. When your biological body become alien to you. That you do not have the gender and body you were meant to have. My whole body feels alien to me, like it's not my body. Do you understand???   

 Dysphoria, the feeling that you are born with the wrong body can give you stress related symptoms. Like a feeling of dissatisfaction, anxiety, and restlessness and discomfort.   

My breasts make me dysphoric because I know what they're for. Feeding babies ugh... But they also make me dysphoric because they feel so alien to me that I have to cover them up. It makes me dysphoric that I have a womb, ovaries, eggs and bleed once a month. A fetus to me is like an alien, foreign object that do not belong inside of my body. It just does not feel right to me. It's uncomfortable for me to have to touch down there when I wash in the shower or change tampons. I don't feel comfortable in a female body or to have female body functions. Does dysphoria sound to you like a choice?!   

The only way you'd be able to understand that it's not a choice is to go through it your self. You let your religion stand in the way of understanding what it means to be transgender.  You seem incapable of understanding that it's not a choice. Are you like, somehow able to go inside people's minds and know how they feel and experience their bodies?! Do you know how I feel right now?!! The answer is, you don't!!! So how can you say it's a choice when you have no clue what I go through, what transgender people go through?!  

When it comes to choice however, you are half right! Being transgender is not a choice though, but choosing to do something about it is, like transitioning. Going on hormones and surgically change your outer appearance to match how you feel on the inside is of course a choice. I have done a choice to not transition myself, to not go through HRT and SRS despite of my dysphoria. Not all people even though they struggle with dysphoria have the possibility, or are able to go through with something like that. Transitioning is a really serious matter, not everybody can!Ôªø""

**That person:** "" Sorry about your experience, but sounds like they won. You let them determine who you were going to be. All good. STILL...YOU made the choice. Not gonna disrespect you or your community, just in your heart of hearts, except the fact that it was still a Choice you made. Live your best life""

**Me:** "" No I made the choice to not transition because I would not be comfortable or satisfied with the result, neither would it have done anything to help me with the dysphoria. I did not choose to not transition because I let people define who I am. There are people who have transitioned, and feeling that their dysphoria became worse 2-3 years after the transition. Transitioning does not necessarily help for everyone.   

Yes I made the choice not to transition because I'm in the middle of questioning. I'm struggeling with dysphoria, but at the same time I also do not feel any more comfortable with transitioning. It just wouldn't do anything for me, the dysphoria would still be there same as it is now. Probably worse if I had transitioned. If I had transitioned it would only have reminded me that I'm not biologically how I wish I could have been. It would have reminded me that my genitals are really just a skin graft from my arm and partly my own biological genitals. That on the outside I appear to look like a male, but on the inside there are female internal organs. I wouldn't have been able to live with that as it would only have made me feel even more like a broken person. That is how I personally experience it any way.  

I'm not sure you quite understand what I'm trying to say. You think of being transgender as a choice when it's not. Being transgender and suffering from dysphoria is not a choice! But transitioning however is a choice that many choose to do in order to help with their dysphoria. You are still transgender even though you do not transition. It's a myth that all transgender people transition. We don't all experience things the exact same way. Transgender meaning: ""Someone who do not identify with the gender assigned to them at birth."" Think of transgender people who have a condition that would make them bleed to death if they were to surgically transition. Idk what that condition is called but anyway, they will have to live their life with the body they were born with even though their dysphoria are crippling. They are still transgender, but they have their own reason why they can't or do not wish to transition.Ôªø""  
 

**That person:**  Why is it so important to you to put the ""you chose this""?You are being very disrespectful.Like I said before ignorance is a choice.""

When I came out as gay my family supposedly did a 180 and ""supports"" gay people now but they continue to vote for the most conservative candidates possible so that's a lie. I told my mom recently that I was trans and she became very hostile for about a week and now just seems to be ignoring that I ever said anything. 

I suppose most of me wanting to repress the fact that I'm trans comes from all the negative things that come with it. It's hard for me to be proud of my identity or want to go forward with transition when it means that my family would disown me or ban me from family gatherings. I carry pepper spray with me everywhere just in case. I don't use public bathrooms under any circumstance. Transition is extremely expensive and my family doesn't seem to have any intention of helping but I don't have my own insurance. Also once I start hormones my ID picture will eventually look like an entirely different person and will have my dead name on it and I will be outed every time I use it which could be dangerous, especially in Alabama. And with the memo that went out on Sunday from the Trump Admin. who knows what's gonna happen to trans people in the next couple years.

I just feel like I'm constantly fighting with myself because I know that transition would be the best thing for me because it would make me more comfortable in my body and with myself, but it's potentially dangerous just living in America as a trans person and sometimes I can't help but think sometimes ""this wouldn't have happened if you just stayed a cis girl"" or ""you wouldn't have to deal with this if you don't transition"". 

Basically, I am not trying to repress the fact that I am trans, but I struggle with constantly thinking about repressing it and I was wondering how you guys fought those thoughts.",asktransgender

Looks like I was just worrying unnecessarily. Because of all the bullying and trauma, and having been treated like I'm not a human being by others for so long, In my mind I often fear the worst. In this case I worried that the doctor I have had for years now would be uncomfortable with me or judgemental after I told him about my dysphoria and possibly being transgender.

But he were so kind, and wondered how I were doing. And then wished me the best on my way home. Now I feel a bit bad that I would worry about such a ting when he's the best doctor you could ever have!

"[nsfw] Really struggling to not be disgusted by someone I saw online (about AGP, crossdressing, all the interesting stuff)","(Content-warnings: possibly internalised transphobia, kink-shaming??)

Hello everyone. I'm a trans woman and a regular contributor to this and other trans subs. I'm honestly a pretty stereotypical trans-feminine type, minus the anime and the wanting to be a cat thing. I mean, I *love* cats. But I don't want to be one. And right now, I'm struggling. I don't even know if this is right place to post about this but I figured it probably wasn't as much the wrong place as other subs I'm part of, so...

So basically I have a profile on *one of those sites* (you know the one) and I saw a group post where someone had written ""You can talk to me if you want, I'm a CD with real tits"". Well, I was intrigued. I've always been intrigued by the overlap between trans- (usually -feminine) people and cross-dressing because although it's something I've never experienced I do of course know that there are a lot of people who came to realise their trans identities through cross-dressing and the idea is so prevalent that at first I didn't think I even *could* be trans because I'd never crossdressed (!!) So I posted about this one some cross-dressing subs and was amazed to learn something which I think probably most people know; that lots of people cross-dress for lots of different reasons, some people are gay and do it for the performativeness of drag, some are quite happy and content straight men for whom its a fetish, and some of closeted trans women unable or unwilling to transition for societal or personal reasons. And for a lot of people, there's an overlap. I found that really interesting to learn and of course anyone whose followed the Rupaul controversy will know that trans women practically invented drag and in times gone-by when being trans was even less acceptable than it is now, that drag was an important part of the acceptance of trans-feminine identity historically.

Okay, sorry for rambling. Anyway, for those reasons I was intrigued and I clicked on this person's profile. So, first of all, this person goes by male pronouns and a male name. Okay, that's fine and valid. And, yep, has ""real"" tits. They had, as they proudly stated on their profile, recently flown to Thailand to have them done. And they were ""saving for the Big-O"". Judging from their profile and photos they were not now, and had never been, on HRT.  The rest of their listed kinks were... kind of as you'd expect. A lot of forced feminization and sissification fantasies. A lot of humiliation and degredation fetishes. Based on their profile it... kind of seemed like their life revolved around these fetishes and that they didn't really identify as a person outside of their kinks.

Now, again, forced feminization and sissification are a whole family of interesting kinks that I just don't understand. Of course growing up in the 'wrong body' is a kind of horrific experience and that trauma can manifest in a huge variety of ways, not least in a kink family which is fairly obviously an expression of an unconscious desire to be your true self in the face of a society which mostly disapproves of us. Don't get me wrong, I have my kinks (or rather my addictions have me, as Scroobius Pip wrote) but they're a lot more.. ah, 'vanilla', in comparison.

Still though. SO MANY QUESTIONS! Such as, 1, if you want tits, why save to get them implanted when HRT is less dangerous, cheaper, and will help you pass better? When you can get it free, eventually, on the NHS. I mean sure a lot of trans women do get implants eventually but its usually hormones first. (I do know a trans woman who says she only transitioned because she wanted tits but I'm pretty sure that's self-deprecating humour, heh, I never asked.) And why ""save"" for ""the big O""? Again, that's eventually free on the NHS. I'm guessing they were saving to have it done in Thailand because no health care professional in the UK would refer them in their current psycho-sexual identity. (Okay but why not at least *pretend* to be trans?) The only way I could make sense of this wealth of seemingly contradictory information was also written clearly in the ""Gender"" and ""Role"" boxes on their profile, where it said: ""Crossdressing/Transvestite MALE"". Not one of the innumerable options to denote a feminine or even trans identity. So... I guess... that's what they are, and how they see themselves. But honestly this is not something I understand at all. Honestly I'm too dysphoric to even put ""MTF"" for myself because I don't feel like I'm ""MTF transsexual"". I feel like a woman.

And of course I don't want to kink-shame anyone but this is a pretty huge thing, no? Most sexual desire is driven hormonally. It's dangerous to take anti-birth-sex hormones with no E or T supplement. Your bones atrophy. And it's very bad for mental health too. A lot of people who post to this sub are trans-questioning in a pattern which is fairly easy to recognize (""I'm AMAB but I always wanted to be a woman--AM I TRANS??!"" Yep, been there.) but every so often we get someone posting for whom it's harder to offer advice. Like, what would you say to someone who says they're going off HRT because they've decided they're not really trans, because they never really wanted to be a woman socially, only during sex, and they found that when their sex-drive disappeared because of the AAs they lost the desire to transition because that desire had been sexual, not social. Or that they didn't like the eventual appearance of a ""feminine"" sexuality under E. I mean a lot of this stuff is hard to unpack, at least at first. But that's one of the great things about HRT. For a lot of us, you suddenly *know*, one way or the other. At this point I wouldn't really care if I never had sex again because the way I'm treated as a woman is so much more important to me. But I didn't know it would be like that until I started identifying, and being identified as, a woman. And I just think that, if this person has ""the big O"", isn't that going to basically nuke most of their sexual desires? Have they thought about the consequences of this thoroughly? For someone who seems to base so much of their current identity around a fetish, that seems like an incredibly... rash.. decision.

At this point, a word came to mind. It's an ugly word which describes a history of terrible science, flawed research and an awful transphobic and phallocentric bias. [A word to describe a phenomenon that most of us, including myself, don't think exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6czRFLs5JQo&amp;feature=youtu.be) But it's hard to argue that wanting to be a woman as a sexual fetish *never exists* when you meet people like this. And every so often on this sub I'm tempted to think that the OP might be AGP. Now to be clear I do *not* believe that any trans people are AGP. I think that AGP, if it exists, must be solely a cis thing. I think although trans people want to and do enjoy having sex as our identified gender, obviously for nearly all of us sex-dysphoria a fairly small part of why we make the huge decision to socially transition. But in the case of the person who only wanted to transition in order to have sex as a woman like the above posters who sometimes come to this sub, it's hard not to think ""AGP"".

Another thing which really kind of creeped me out about this person is that they're basically a living embodiment of what TERFs think trans women both *are* and yet also *should be*. I lurk *a lot* on TERF reddit--it's probably a self-harm thing--and I see this *a lot*. First of all, they're not ""appropriating"" female anything by using a male name and pronouns. Nor are they trying to ""trick anybody"" like the TERFs think people like me are trying to do. They probably don't even use female toilets when out and about--that must be an, ah, ""interesting"" experience for them. Exactly what TERFs want. And of course the roots of their personal and physical identity seem pretty strongly tied to extreme sexual fetishism, which again is exactly why TERFs *think* people like *me* transition.

So I guess as problematic as it is, a lot of my discomfort is also related to Justine and even Tiffany's arguments from Contrapoints. Is the world ready for people like this? Is the world ready for people like this when I can almost guarantee that most people meeting this person will assume that they are trans, even though they are possibly/probably definitely not? Will assume that people who *are* trans are like that. I know it's extremely problematic to worry about being judged by cis people on the basis of someone else's identity but in a cis-supremecist society, that's also an extremely difficult trap to escape from. I mean for comparison I knew someone in school who was an extremely homophobic and transphobic bully. They were so transphobic that they pushed me into the closet for nearly a decade at least. Today? They are ""Scotland's leading transgender poet"". This person disgusts me too. I'm disgusted that I share a gender identity with them. Even today I find it hard to persuade myself to use their correct pronouns and not misgender them.

So, like, I'm trying really hard not to kinkshame here. I don't want to be *that person*. I don't want to be Tiffany Tumbles. I'm so curious as to what would cause someone to assume this kind of identity, so seemingly similar to my own in terms, presumably, of dysphoria, and a desire to change our bodies to be more similar to how we feel inside, and yet so... incredibly... *different* as well. What do you lovely people think? Have you ever met people who are similar? What did you think/how did you react? Have I drunk the TERF kool-aid? Do I need to do a lot of work on myself to overcome internalized shame and transphobia and kinkshaming? If so, how?? Overcoming deeply entrenched biases is hard, especially when we deal with so much prejudice against people like us. I'm looking forward to an interesting discussion in the comments. :-)",asktransgender
Something about our haters just occurred to me,"I was browsing the comments from the peanut gallery on a major news website that had something about the recent memo regarding the legal definition of gender for Title IX, or whatever it's supposed to be.

Something just occurred to me.

You know how our critics like to say that we will be forever defined by our sex chromosomes?

There's a reason for that.  We can change our hormones.  We can change the appearance of our bodies drastically.  Some of us are fortunate to ""pass"" as our identified gender nearly 100% of the time.  But right now, science doesn't give us a way to change the sex hormones that are only visible upon examination of a specialist.

Why on earth would anyone want to define a person by something that can only be examined under a microscope?

If we had no medical technology to modify our hormones, our critics would gleefully demand that we would be forever defined by our hormones.

If we had no SRS, our critics would gleefully demand that we would be forever defined by our genitals.

You know what?  It doesn't matter.  No matter what happens, **they will gleefully demand that we be defined by something we can't change.**  They have hate in their hearts, and haters are going to hate!

So go out, be happy, and enjoy your life, and don't worry about sex chromosomes, because the moment that we find a way to change our sex chromosomes, they will move the goal posts.",asktransgender

Drunkenly come out? LONG,"Long story:

2 years ago I told myself ""Your next (24th) birthday you'll start hormones."" I didn't. A year later I said, ""Your 25th birthday you'll start hormones."" I didn't believe me at the time. I spent an good part of the year talking myself out of it.

This summer, after a fight with my dad, I decided to start hormones in secret. Just a few friends know. Cut to now (3 months HRT): I look like a guy, sound like a guy, but have boobs.

I've been drinking a lot lately due to stress. Because of this I've been sharing a ton of trans memes on Facebook (where my dad and stepmom are active).

Now part of me is thinking about getting so drunk on my birthday in 2 days that I drunkenly text my dad that I'm trans.

What makes it awkward for me is that though I live thousands of miles apart, I still dont make a move without his input. (So me doing hormones without consulting him will be a whole other issue).

Confused and scared,"I've always felt like a girl stuck in a boy's body, but for my entire life I buried those feelings as far down as I possibly could out of fear and a sense of shame, as I suspect many people do. A few months ago, however, I had a crisis that led to an epiphany of sorts about my identity, and I made the decision to start seeing a therapist at a trans-friendly health clinic. Since starting therapy I've done a lot of reflecting on myself, what I want out of life, and what a change in my gender expression would mean for me and my career, but I'm just as confused and scared as ever.

I keep going back and forth between feeling mostly happy and like I'll be okay if I don't make some sort of transition, and feeling completely depressed at the prospect of being seen as a cisgender man for the rest of my life. Just typing this out and seeing the word 'man' on the screen feels alien and strange - but so does the idea of people seeing me as something other than the quiet, awkward looking guy that I present as. For those who have transitioned or are transitioning, do these feelings start to go away once you start HRT? Are you ever less scared or confused?

I'm also curious how it has affected your careers, as I have a very public job and can't simply switch employers or careers. This has been feeding into my confusion and depression about transitioning, so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",asktransgender

Question regarding discrimination by pharmacist in NJ,"I am an FTM transman locates in NJ who was denied needles at a local Walgreens pharmacy on the basis of my trans status. I have been using these needles for over a year with no problems from any other pharmacy and under counsel of the Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia, who prescribed my hormones. 

Two months ago, my fianc√© (a cisgender man) went into the same pharmacy with the same pharmacist working, told him exactly what they were for just as I had, and they were sold to him without a problem. The prescription needles I initially was prescribed are not covered under my insurance and so I have been using over the counter insulin needles to administer a my injection subcutaneously (rather than IM). I have been injecting subq for nearly 3 years as I was advised to do by my trans specialist doctor. The insulin needles are the only affordable option for me and have been just as effective as the ones I was initially prescribed. 

The pharmacist flat out refused to sell them to me, telling me it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot gonna happen. End of story.‚Äù I called corporate and the woman on the phone immediately switched from saying ‚Äúsir‚Äù to ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù upon me revealing my FTM status. When I pointed it out that I was a man she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I have gay friends‚Äù. I spoke with the manager and assistant manager of the location who continuously blew me off, even hung up on me prematurely. 

The pharmacist initially tried to tell me that they weren‚Äôt the right size and ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt work‚Äù, then told the manager after I called that they were ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù‚Äîthey never said they were out of stock the day I was in there (Friday 10/19, I called management today, Tuesday 10/23).

FFS Referral Letter - Summary and AMA,"Hey  all! A few weeks ago I had a meeting with a head therapist at Kaiser in  SoCal to get a recommendation letter for FFS. When I was preparing for the  appointment, I tried to find out what to expect and couldn't find any  information. I promised a couple friends that I'd take notes for them so  they could plan for their own appointments, and I thought y'all might  be interested as well. Here's my notes from the appointment. Feel free  to ask me any other questions you might have.

&amp;#x200B;

""The  therapist was very nice. She said that her primary goal would be to  have ‚Äúa new pair of eyes‚Äù on my case. As such, she asked a lot of the  same questions that I‚Äôd already heard from my regular therapist. She  asked for my name and preferred pronouns, asked ‚Äúhow did you know,‚Äù  ‚Äúwhat does transition mean to you,‚Äù etc. Basically just building a rough  case history from scratch. After that we reviewed the ongoing pysch  evaluation ‚Äì the questionnaire I fill out at the beginning of every  appointment. It‚Äôs basically a ‚Äúhow are you feeling today‚Äù kind of thing.  She showed me the graph they generate, and how my mental health has  trended upward over time. My progress exceeded their expectations, so  she congratulated me for that. She then asked if I had any documented  intersex conditions and how long I had been living ‚Äúfull time‚Äù as my  gender.

After that we moved on to a  discussion specific to surgical evaluation. She told me that I would  need to have a recent physical exam to ensure that I am healthy enough  for surgery and should schedule one as soon as possible. She asked how  my ‚Äújourney‚Äù so far has affected my physical health. She asked how the  treatments I‚Äôve received so far have impacted my dysphoria.

The  most surprising thing (to me) was that she asked if I wanted to be  ‚Äústealth.‚Äù That led into a long discussion about passing, stealth, and  whether these are productive concepts and healthy goals to have ‚Äì I  maintain that they are not, in an ideal world. She responded that  there‚Äôs no ‚Äúright way to be trans‚Äù and that passing and stealth are  perfectly reasonable objectives. So that was interesting.

Then  she asked about any prior procedures I‚Äôve had, whether on or off the  books, so to speak. She asked about substance abuse and self-harm,  reminding me that 1 year with no self-harm incidents is a requirement  for surgery through Kaiser. She asked about my education, employment,  and living situation, establishing that I won‚Äôt be put at risk by  accepting the surgery. She asked about my social support structures,  hobbies and interests, legal concerns, and any other things in my life  that might be impacted by having major surgery ‚Äì in effect making sure  that I am in as stable a life situation as possible.

After  that we moved on to informed consent, where she made sure I understood  what the procedure entails and what the risks are, as well as the  financial costs. (Which for me are basically zero.) She told me that the  wait time from that meeting to surgery is usually about one year. (I  later found out that I have access to another location in the network  that may have much shorter wait times.) At the end she said that she thought I was doing great, and would be writing me my recommendation right away.""",asktransgender

Does queer mean anything literally?,"I am sure this type of question is asked all the time but I figured here is a good place to ask. I want to be a good ally of this community and having accurate knowledge is step 1.

My understanding is that queer is used as an umbrella term for other minority identities along the sexual gender spectrums.

But can someone without any minority identity claim queerness as an identity? 

Could I, a cis straight Male, be queer?

Is it a matter of motive? What motives are acceptable and what are not? Is there a line or principle that governs this?

I can list two times in the past few months that I have stayed up past 12 lol.  That‚Äôs not it.  When I do stay up past 11 I get extremely tired during the day.  I used to be able to sleep from 2-7 and not have an issue with staying awake but now it‚Äôs so hard.  The issue is that I have a gf now who stays up really late and I feel bad for leaving her because I have to go to sleep.  Is this normal on HRT? Cypro and Estrogen 2mg.

On a scale of 0-10 my gender dysphoria used to be around a 2.  Now it has gone up to 8.  This has just been fuckin up my world lately.

It has not gotten that bad yet or at the least I refuse to let myself do that again.  It‚Äôs hard though.  I sit here in my bed and I‚Äôm just so alone.  Everyone I know is just another puppet it feels like.  It feels like I am unable to actually connect and just be with other people.  It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a whole web of people and friends out there and my lines have been severed.  I do have a few lights shining into this darkness which would be a couple of online friends and more specifically my gf (gosh she‚Äôs so cute and amazing).  But sometimes they aren‚Äôt around and I am left yet again with my thoughts which are like wasps.  I am actually keeping my room clean (hoarding is an issue in my family...this shit has fucked me up beyond belief), I am taking better care of myself like washing my hair everyday, using lotion on my skin, actually doing my laundry every week lol, HRT, a diet so I have been losing weight (or, At least, I haven‚Äôt gained anything back from what I‚Äôve lost).  Yet I can‚Äôt find anything to fill this gaping void.  Maybe I should see a therapist.  I should see a therapist.  But my anxiety is too bad for me to seek one out (haha I love my life).  Besides talking to friends and browsing reddit I don‚Äôt really have any escapes.

Am I trans (ftm)?,"Okay, I need some answers here. Like real bad. I first started questioning my gender identity about 2-3 years ago, and I'm now 17. I told my sister, and she said it was probably just a phase. So I ignored it. But it hasn't gone away. 

As a kid, being a twin, I'd still play with dolls with my sister, but I preferred playing with male dolls as my main character in games. In video games, I'd pretty much always play as a male character, and same in role-playing games as a child with family and friends. I had a huge tomboy phase, but I didn't like sports, so it was less a tomboy in doing stereotypically male things and rather that I just wanted to be a guy. I've always felt detached from my name, too, as well as my middle name. 

On TV and in books, my favourite characters would always be guys and I'd struggle to relate to female characters. That's still the case today. I enjoy creative writing in my free time, and struggle to write from a woman's perspective. 

These days, my chest makes me uncomfortable and I try to wear the baggiest clothing I can. For the past few years I've shopped in the mens section or unisex sections online, but when I have to go shopping with my parents, and I point out something, they're like, 'honey that's men's'. I'm also struggling with my sexuality, because I'm attracted to girls exclusively, but calling myself gay/lesbian/sapphic/wlw, it all feels wrong, and I'd feel more comfortable expressing my sexuality from a male perspective. 

I dream of an ideal life in the future or an alternate universe and I'm always a guy. 

The problem is I don't necessarily like stereotypically masculine things. Most of my interests are rooted in film, games, and literature, although I suppose slashers are my favourite, if gore/violence count as non-feminine. But, as I said, I never liked sports, and most of my friends growing up were girls.

"Any FTMs have experience with ""hormone seizures?""","Six months after starting T, I began having increasingly frequent seizure-like episodes. I noticed two trends regarding when the episodes would happen: I would often have one four days after each T shot, and I tended to get a bunch around the beginning of my period cycle. I switched from shots to gel, but was still having episodes around the beginning of my cycle. I then stopped gel, and the frequency and intensity of the episodes has decreased since then.

My PCP doesn't think hormones could be causing these symptoms, but I've spoken to other health professionals who said that hormones affect the body in many ways, not all of which are understood. Personally, since the correlation has been so spot-on, I'm inclined to suspect causation.

(Note: I got an EEG and it came back normal, so these episodes may not be actual seizures. My body switches between limp and spasming, but I'm conscious for most of it. It might be syncope, but I've been seeing a cardiologist and we haven't found anything that would cause fainting spells.)

Not sure if this is dysphoria or I‚Äôm ‚Äúfaking‚Äù it,"Hi,

So a bit of context, I have a very transphobic and homophobic family which doesn‚Äôt make things easy. Since I was very young (I‚Äôm now 16) I‚Äôve always wanted to be a girl and to have a girls body, even before I had any idea that was possible. When I discovered surgery I was really interested by the idea of it and felt like I should get it when I could, but I knew my parents would never be ok with it. The thoughts that I‚Äôd much rather have a girls body came and went in intensity but were pretty much always there. I don‚Äôt absolutely detest my body - and Ive met trans people who do which is why I‚Äôm scared that the feelings I have aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreally‚Äù me being trans - but I don‚Äôt like it either, I don‚Äôt like facial hair or body hair or being shirtless as it just, makes me uncomfortable. However, until recently I never felt pressured to try on girls‚Äô clothes, but now I really want to just to see how it feels. I never played with ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù toys either like dolls or anything and my parents raised me to be extremely masculine (typical conservative family) and to be honest, I still somewhat enjoy many such activities with my dad.

But socially, I struggle to get on with boys my age and much prefer the company of girls and often I want to be seen as one of them, not just some guy who hangs around with girls. I go to an all boys school and I‚Äôve started struggling to keep up my friendships because I just feel, different I guess. I imagined being called she/her pronouns and it makes me somewhat happy, but at the same time I don‚Äôt feel pain every time someone calls me he/him and I know many trans people really hate their old pronouns, so I don‚Äôt know whether my feelings add up to gender dysphoria or just me wishing for something I can‚Äôt have.

many people think concept of being transgender and medical transition is new,"Transgender people have been around forever, as everyone in this sub knows, but a lot of people believe that being transgender in the modern context we have today is a new one, even being something that is only a few years old.

We can give examples of some cultures with third genders, but these are often dismissed as not being the same thing. It is legit to say that it's not the same thing as modern transgender people with medical transition, it's actually much closer to modern non-binary people in many ways. (the enbies were first, y0!)

We can even give examples people who were ""women living as men"" as being transgender men. People sometimes dismiss these accounts due to the fact that women were forced into bad situations based on gender roles at the time.  Essentially that women pretended to be men to escape gender oppression - not that they were trans guys. 

So ignoring these common refutations - we still have rock solid examples as technology progressed.  At the turn of last century we see more and more things that look like we have today.  The modern idea of transgender people publicly changing their info legally and having medical transition is a century or more old.  

Here's a ""Transvestite License"" from 1928 Germany

https://i.imgur.com/4cWDVHw.png

This was early days.  The term transgender did not exist, the term ""transsexual"" would be coined very soon.  

The person in question is Katharina T. We don't have many records (they were burned), but for all intents and purposes this person was a transgender man.  I'll use the terms he/him.  He went to the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft (institute for sexual studies) in Berlin and saw Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld.  We know he was denied a petition have his name changed to a male name.

This is early-early-days trans pioneering complete with getting gatekeept.  Ninety years ago.  It was still progress.

Here's another couple of people:
1922, 1928, 1931 MTF SRS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Richter

She had orcheictomy, penectomy, and early vaginoplasty.  

She had permission from the police to live as a woman, and of course she fled Germany because of the Nazis.

1931 MTF SRS. Lili Elbe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Elbe

She had her name legally changed along with her sex.   

She had three surgeries, and was going to have a fourth.   
She died due to infection and limitations in medical technologies at the time.  

A lot of this happened in Germany and surrounding areas, but as I said, the nazis happened.

This photo is of the nazis burning the archives of the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft, this is LGBT history being burned.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG

That brought so much progress to a screeching halt, but slow progress happened elsewhere.

Dr. Benjamin began work with HRT in the 1940s - over half a century ago.   
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7733806

Including prescribing Premarin to a child, we've lost track of the child after she was referred to Germany for surgery.

so she was pregnant with me in phillipines and accidently walked into a hair salon run by trans folks and she freaked out and said she considers them as 'beasts'. she said that if i ever transitioned she doesnt want me in her life anymore. 

It used to hurt a lot but reading/pondering about spiritual ideas about karma and buddhism gives me some solace, that its not my fault that I'm transgender

....its obviously plastic water bottles...all that BPA 

so ultimately its THEIR PROBLEM lol. I'm OKAY with being a transwoman, so what the hell am I supposed to do for them? This also hurts me in a way because I can't help them and I am causing them pain....like my existence is painful for them as trans.

I'm really afraid for my family....my transitioning will break them apart but i tried myriad times to explain my condition....but i have a fucking right to live an authentic life, trying to deny me this is just fucked up.

So I just got back from visiting with my family and I'm pissed off and mildly suicidal. (Post-Trump Trans Announcement),"I'm out to my parents, and they're supportive, which is fantastic. I'm covering all my bases in college three states away from them (America), so they weren't here for this.

My family is split down the middle on politics, and whenever they gather they wind up arguing about it. As someone who generally likes peace, I don't care for it, but being trans has fundamentally screwed with this balance. 

My grandparents are traditional conservative. My grandfather has a personality very similar to Trump- multiple famliy members have commented that behind his back.  But my real concern is with my uncle, who is alt-right (if you asked him, he probably wouldn't say so, but he's a lot more set in his ways than he thinks). I wanted to talk about sports and jokes and normal family stuff, but instead I got a smattering of NPC memes, defenses of Kavanaugh and scoffs regarding all 86 genders. He also listens to Sargon of Akkad, PragerU and Black Pigeon Speaks- I don't know if you all know who these guys are (I used to listen to them a lot when I was still repressing). 

He's definitely gotten more unhinged in recent years, but the longer he is allowed to debate the rest of my family, the worse it'll get for me when he inevitably gets revolted when: 1. He finds out I'm a girl, and 2. When his conspiracy mindset concludes that it's the faults of my parents, my college, and basically everyone.

Here's the thing: I'm very much uninterested in fighting my family members; I would rather get into a nasty car accident, and that's exactly what I thought when I was driving down the highway late at night coming back home from all that. I've already attempted once (and my uncle knows about it) and I'm aware of the severity of those thoughts. But I couldn't stop fantasizing about swerving my car into each oncoming tree which emerged from the shadows on my right. 

I can't exactly cut communications, as it's my family and this uncle's wife, my aunt, cares deeply about me. I would be out to her if I knew it wouldn't create tension in their already-fragile marriage. As for my grandparents, they'll likely disown me, but from a strategic perspective, they're far less important. I have other family members who would be supportive, or at least have a stiff drink before coming to terms with it. I'm not a bad person, and my family likes and respects me, so that helps. 

So what do? There's no convincing these people, and I can't just ignore them. This has the potential to rip my family apart, and I'm legitimately scared...",asktransgender

"No matter what way you transition and in what way and to what extend you transition, you are valid!

You are valid and so is your dysphoria.

Transition doesn‚Äôt look the same for everyone and whatever solution is suitable to reduce your dysphoria IS VALID.

Sometimes I see trans individuals call other trans individuals fetishists or tenders for not doing this or that to transition. Remember : this is transition according to your view, not according to someone else‚Äôs.

No matter if you need SRS and HRT and want to go the whole 9 yards or whether you only want some portion of available treatments and not others : you are valid and so is your gender.

Let‚Äôs not make the same mistakes Trump made. Let‚Äôs not erase each other. The rest of the world sees us as one bunch of creeps. We only have each other and a few precious allies and partners. We need to stick tightly together.

I love each and everyone of you.

"‚ÄúOh My God, He‚Äôs Into Me‚Äù: One Trans Gal‚Äôs Experience with a Man of the Straight Persuasion, or ‚ÄúHow I Discovered I Am Also Very Into Men‚Äù","This month, I eclipsed 4 years of HRT, and am dating a man for the first time in my life. In hindsight, I always knew that I was attracted to men, but a combination of things always kept me from acknowledging those feelings. Bisexuality was seen as ‚Äújust someone kidding themselves‚Äù when I was growing up, and since I was attracted to women, I was convinced that I could not also be attracted to men. 

In spite of feeling this way, there were times when I *knew*, and just simply refused to acknowledge it. I remember my heart skipping a beat every time I saw the face of the quarterback of my football team. I remember blushing when my male friends would hug me and confide their emotions and feelings in me that they didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing with the world, because men have to be strong, right? I remember thinking ‚ÄúI can see why the girls are so into him, if I was a girl I would love to be his girlfriend. Too bad I‚Äôm not a girl ha ha ha...‚Äù. I remember being a young boy watching Disney movies when I was home alone, and wishing so badly I could go out as Cinderella for Halloween, and wanting to be some guy‚Äôs ‚Äúprincess‚Äù.

I recently found myself once again single and in a position to explore my sexuality more, and began casually dating men. I realize I am quite lucky because it has been pretty easy for me - I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just that times are changing a bit and men are more open, or if lots of men are just willing to make an exception for me. I was enjoying just having casual sex with guys while figuring myself out and what I want and need out of life, until he came along.

Not even in my wildest dreams could I have come up with a man like him. He is so tall and handsome and talented, and he‚Äôs into *me*. The trans woman. This beautiful straight man is into *me*. Like, what? From the first time we hooked up, we both agreed that there was something undeniably special between us. The sex was pretty great but didn‚Äôt enter uncharted territory - I‚Äôm semi-comfortable with my situation down there but don‚Äôt ever ask guys to do anything with it, I guess out of subconscious fear that it will scare them off. But he wanted to learn how to make me feel good and we got there over the next few times we met up. For the first time in my life, I fantasized about a man going down on me, and it was some of the most intimate romantic sex I‚Äôve ever had when it actually happened. There was so much laughing and smiling and then moaning...omg.

He‚Äôs not ashamed to be out in public with me and loves having me on his arm. He loves hearing about everything that makes me who I am, and I don‚Äôt feel like I need to hide old pictures or old stories about my former self. He‚Äôs always excited to learn more things about ‚Äúmy world‚Äù and the LGBT community in general. He tells me that he truly feels like he can be himself around me and for the first time doesn‚Äôt need to compromise who he is either. We are both into the same dorky hobbies and get to enjoy them together, also a first for me, and I think for him as well.

I never thought that I would find myself in this situation. I never thought that I would even so much as pass. I never thought that I would transition at all to be honest, let alone be 4 years in and dating such a wonderful man.. Hopefully this is a message of hope for anyone else just stumbling upon this community like I did almost 7 years ago. There will be people out there who like and accept you for who you are ‚ù§Ô∏è

How does estrogen or testosterone affects the capacity of trans athletes?,"Title pretty straightforward, I guess.

I am asking this based in some questions I got from a post on r/news about a polemic involving a trans woman that won some competition. Can't remember the details exactly.

Well, from the experience of users in this sub, I can say that being in estrogen reduces muscle mass in a heavy way. But does it affects the heart?  And in the same way as other muscles? And more, is it affected in a way that can be unhealthy for health?

Also, about lungs. A normal male's lungs have more capacity than a woman's. And does it maintains it's capacity?

And about the skeletal structure? Does it affects in sports at all or not?

And does the other way around happens to trans men? Does being in testosterone for enough time brings the person to a male level competition?

Finally, since it takes time, does competition sports require the person to be in hormones for some time? A trans woman that started E yesterday isn't the same as one who started E 1 year ago, so the first one could enter in the competition?",asktransgender

Trying to overcome denial. Please help?,"I'm sorry for the long post...

For the past few months, I've been in an awful cycle of what I think is dysphoria, denial, acceptance, and disassociation.. I can't focus on anything.. even my college work because all my mind can do is think about whether or not I'm trans.

I really feel like I want to be... but when I feel doubtful I lose all of my sense of identity. I have no idea who I am at this point. I'm 20 years old, assigned male at birth and I believe I'm female.

In support groups or other places.. I feel both strangely complimented when called a girl, refers to me with female pronouns, or uses the name I've been trying.. Raelynn. But at the same time it feels very odd and strange. Not bad but different, and I'm not used to it.

I feel that if I transition, I want to go all the way with SRS eventually and everything. But I have these doubts that I can't put a reason to. I can only put reasons to why I feel good being female. I know I have a bit of dysphoria and have had signs of being female, whether I knew it or not since I was 5.

I still consider if this is a phase.. and I really hope it isn't. I've even come out to several people and still doubt myself.. I just want to overcome it already.. I know I have dysphoria to some degree.. For example, I felt way better after shaving my arms and legs for the first time last week, but feel awful today because I didn't have time to shave my face this morning.

I've also wondered if I'm just attached to the idea of being trans because I spend so much time alone and I fight through everything myself, but since this community is so supportive.. I feel loved in a way I haven't before, and I feel like I'm not alone anymore.. 

Is it possible I just want to be trans for the sake of being trans? Has it ever been a phase to anyone? How did some of you know you had dysphoria? ... and how did you overcome your denial?

"As an adult, talking to a parent about surgery","Hi! I am a trans person and I would like some advice on how I can discuss my transition better with one of my parents, or try to see things from her perspective more. I'm really sorry this is super long and rant-y but I want her to feel okay about me and at the same time I don't want to feel like I betraying her and these various feelings are plaguing me daily. I posted this to /r/transparents but it hasn't seemed to get attention.

For some background, we live far away from each other (about a 4-hour plane ride) and she hasn't seen me in person since I came out. We have video called a lot though. She accepts me and tries to support me. She uses my new name and pronouns as much as she can but I think she is still struggling.

Before I started social transition, I didn't know if I wanted surgery. Now I know I want surgery and am actively researching ways to do it with insurance..I have found one surgeon who would do the surgery with insurance and we have set a tentative date. The surgeon has honours and decades of experience in reconstructive surgery. and regarding the location, quality, my schedule, tentative healing time, the severity of my dysphoria, and the type of surgery I would be getting, I am sure it's the right choice for me. However, this time isn't convenient for my mom, I can't wait until my next available vacation, which would not be long enough to heal well. and I can't take extra time off work. when I told my mom about my plan she got extremely upset and basically forbade me to get surgery if she wasn't there. I find this ridiculous because... a) it's a surgery I could recover from without 24/7 aid--I will have two weeks off work to recover from the surgery so I would not be exerting myself unnecessarily. And I'm sure if I really needed another week or few days off to heal up completely, my boss would let me. b) I have other options for care. There are friends I could call if I had an emergency, and I could get them to check up on me every day. There is also a service for trans people getting surgery where you can hire a caretaker for a few days while recovering in a hotel. On the other hand it's possible I could ask my dad to come take care of me. Why does it have to be my mom? Why do *I* have to do my transition on *her* terms and *her* schedule? c) I am a financially independent adult with my own rpartment, have had a full time job for years, out of university for a decade, and I can pay for the surgery myself. I want to get this done when I still have a stable, full-time job so I won't have to worry about healing while job hunting because I am considering quitting. I have thought about the surgery a lot, and it excites me/makes me feel relieved and yet every day I am plagued with the growing disgust I have with this part of my body. These are not new feelings, I have felt them since puberty. But ever since discovering I was trans and learning about this surgery the feelings have intensified. For the record, if my insurance goes through and I am able to get the surgery at a price I can afford, I'm going through with it whether she's there or not. I just need to decide what to communicate to my mom. Should pretend like I'm not getting the surgery? Would that hurt her more than telling her the truth?

Right now I am dealing with my dysphoria every day, I feel like I am functioning well, but I feel like that is because I have the optimism in the back of my mind that I will be able to get surgery soon and start physically feeling better/""normal"". But sometimes when I talk to my mom she asks me about my feelings/dysphoria or asks me lots of question. This makes me nervous, upset, and dysphoric after. When I told her i wanted to get the surgery and she forbade me, after I felt extremely dysphoric and depressed, I cried for half an hour, I felt extreme despair and almost felt like it would not be worth living if I couldn't have surgery for a stupid reason like this. I don't want to tell my mom about these feelings. I plan on seeing a therapist to help me deal with the mental burden and stress of starting my medical transition, but I don't want to talk about it with my mom anymore because I feel like she judges me too much... Also she has told me multiple times that I need to start living as my identified gender for a year and go through counselling, THEN start hormones, THEN get surgery. Who is she to tell me how to live my life and what to do with my body? I know what's best for myself. And when it comes to decisions about my body and my life, this is not the first time I've defied her wishes and my decision turned out to be the right decision for me.",asktransgender

Reason being that in an English class of mine, we are writing a paper on a topic of our choosing, and I chose to do it on whether transgender people should be permitted in restrooms in accordance with their identity. Before we do the full paper, however, we have to make a small paper both for and against said topic.

It's really easy to find studies that would say we should be permitted. It's extremely difficult to find ones that say we shouldn't, that are also peer reviewed and published in a respectable source. Thus far I've only found one, and that wasn't an attack on us so much as it was saying that we might be more likely to be attacked in the restroom of our choosing...

Her comments very quickly made me realize that she was unhappy with her gender presentation at the time and I told her I'd support her no matter what. We had become best friends very fast, and after a while, I realized I'd fallen for the woman she was becoming. I remember seeking out the help of this subreddit as I was afraid confessing my love would make her doubt my support and compliments. This group encouraged me to be honest and we've been a couple ever since. Together we walked to the courthouse on election day, and submitted her name change paperwork, even if we were sad when Trump won that night. She transitioned at work, and while it was rough with some, we made many friends who changed their views just seeing her blossom as her happy and true self. I watched my family open their hearts and see love for just love. On vacation this June, the midst of Pride month I asked her to marry me. And today, despite the crappy news going around, I sat in the waiting room as she finished her last step and had her surgery.

Despite the noise, the negative, the pain, there is love and happiness out there and I just thought today would be a good time to remind all of you that no matter how dark it seems, there is light out there. This subreddit helped me make the right, and what has been the best decision of my life.

2. He thinks I am using coming out as trans to mask other issues in my life. Really, isn't being trans even more difficult and traumatizing?

What are some things that have not changed in the last 24 hours? (US government thing),"Trans people have always existed. For the vast majority of history, we didn't really benefit from government recognition or support, but we still existed.

They can't erase the last 5-10 years. Things are really different from how they were a decade ago; we're on TV and in movies, we're all over social media, and we're in community with each other at what twenty years ago would have seemed like a mind-blowing volume. 

There are a LOT of support organizations. There are trans kids coming out in schools everywhere. Trans people are more visible - as people who are just doing their jobs- than ever before. 

People who want to be jerks haven't changed much, but there has been a TON of progress among people who want NOT to be jerks. 

The science around transgender people has not changed. The government can deny it, the same way they deny the science of climate change, but just like reputable scientists believe in (and agitate to address!) real science no matter what the government wants them to do, reputable therapists, psychiatrists and researchers will continue to believe what their eyes, ears, and legitimate science have made clear: trans people are not the bogeyman. 

Making it harder to get an appropriate ID or passport doesn't change any of this. It's a step back. But trans people have been working around this stuff since forever. 

Culturally, awareness that being trans is a real and legitimate thing is a cat that's out of the bag. They're going so hard against it because they're losing - and making laws (which can be overturned, just like they're trying to overturn laws that already exist) is not the end of the world imho.",asktransgender

What do you do to avoid feeling dysphoria?,I avoid mirrors because my source of dysphoria only comes from my masculine face. I have social dysphoria and it's the only thing that I really can't do anything to make myself comfortable person in society without feeling the dysphoria of not being able to express my femininity that I'm feeling. Body dysphoria is avoidable by not getting to know how I look and how puberty changes me. ,asktransgender

"I told my parents two days ago, and they are not fine. At all.","I'm MTF. Itold them saturday night, and it was chaotic. My mom had a panic attack and my dad kept asking if I had gay sex (??), and they both think this is a decision i'm taking that was influenced by someone else.

Sunday was less chaotic, we talked, about how they feel, their massive fears and that they don't want me to make changes until I have a stable job (I'm 20, astronomy student, that means waiting until like 30 or more). I've been clear about my need for HRT, and they got that. My mom called me today asking about places we could go in orden to take the neccesary steps.

The problem is, they are not fine. My sister told me my dad cries by himself, and that my mom is barely eating. They are mad worried, and they feel their world and 'perfect family' (actual quote) fell apart.

Professor deadnamed me in front of my class and my friend today. I've never felt so much pain in one word.,"So I just need to talk about this, so of course I'm going to just make a Reddit post to vent. I've been going as Rachael (MTF)this year during college, and 3/4 of my professors have been extremely accommodating. However, 1 professor who teaches two of my classes is not very great. Not only does that happen to sometimes be embarrassing, my school email (which is used to communicate to basically all professors), still has my deadnamed attached to it. Apparently it won't change unless I get my legal name changed...

So I was in class today (it's an HR class how fucking ironic), and we were talking about sexual harrassment/discrimination. Near the end of class the professor calls on me to answer a question. HOWEVER; He proceeds to say ""Rachael, wait...yeah Rachael, no I mean d√´¬™d≈Ñ¬™m√™, yeah d√´¬™d≈Ñ¬™m√™ can you tell me your opinion about this""

I fucking melted in my chair right there. I've been trying to stealth, and for the most part it's worked. I made a friend in my classes and she was sitting right there. She only knows me as Rachael, NOT MY DEADNAME. I wanted to cry and die at the same time. I meekly answered the question and ran as fast as I could out of there. 

And the fucking nerve of this professor. He emails me shortly after class apologizing for calling me Rachael instead of d√´¬™d≈Ñ¬™m√™. AND he wants me to speak about my experience as a trans individual and title IX on Wednesday. I can't tell if A.) This dude thought I looked like a man; or if B.)

A way to survive for those who need to make Money for transition,"Hello everyone. I like to lurk but yesterday‚Äôs news has driven me to get more involved.  

I am 30 years old and started transition when I was 16.  I was a lost soul and drifted into the adult entertainment ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù to survive. This only lasted a couple years until I was rescued and showed how to make legit money by being a waitress. 

Fast forward to 3 years ago I discovered truck driving. Yes over the road living in the truck kind of driving. It is literally the best route I think for those who can just pack up the little they have or put the rest in storage and go out and make money without having to worry about bills.

I never went to college so of course if you have and are making strides in the tech industry, etc, this isn‚Äôt ideal for you but let‚Äôs just say my first year driving I made $50,000 and was able to save way over half of that since I have no bills. 

The ‚Äúmega‚Äù carriers like swift, Werner, Schneider are all highly corporate and you will not have to deal with discrimination from them. You are on the road anyways so your interactions with people are at a minimum.  The road is a lot friendlier than it used to be, with apps that show all of the truckstops and friendly parking areas to your GPS and smart phone. I have a tv and PlayStation on my truck for entertainment, etc. the industry is about 10% female now, lots of friendly people but most keep to themselves. And you‚Äôre free to be yourself in your truck, practice your voice or makeup or whatever you want without dealing with roommates.

To get started I went to my community college and took a $3000 4-week class, which you can finance if you need to. Or some companies will even train you to get your CDL if you have nothing. My second year I am looking at about $70,000 and it only goes up as long as you keep your record clean and work hard.

Anyways didn‚Äôt mean to ramble and please excuse any mistakes as i don‚Äôt have time to proofread this. If you have any questions at all please feel free to PM or post here ",asktransgender

I loved her to learn how to love. Insight into why people we love come and go.,"Hi, my name is Kishote, I go by Lola when I don‚Äôt identify with my name that day, and I‚Äôm a 22 year old MTF trans individual. Last week, I basically completely lost my best friend because we broke up finally and not the decent kind, I mean we had the bad kind of break up. We are ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but we are not. My parents asked me recently why they don‚Äôt know me as a person, and it‚Äôs because this girl Suzie, has been my best friend for nearly a quarter of my life. She knew something was wrong with me before I even said words. I told her all of my problems whether we were dating or not dating. Suzie was my best friend. We‚Äôve texted every day for 5 years. We‚Äôve traveled the world together, we‚Äôve held each other at our lowest lows. We were very close, the closest. After three years we started to seriously date. For the last two she‚Äôs lived with me and we have barely spent a day apart. She‚Äôs my other half, or was. Now she‚Äôs gone, because I believe that being trans mentally and emotionally stunted me as a person it made me too distracted to give her what she needed for the last year of our relationship when everything progressively went down hill. I have never had a serious relationship, not longer than two months. She taught me everything I know about caring for another person. She taught me how to be a better person. And most importantly she showed me who i was under the mask that I so blindly flaunted to society. She taught me the pain, brutality, and raw savagery of love. She taught me the courage I never had. She taught me to be romantic. Suzie took my angry, cracked, and flawed shell and chiseled it down to the core of what made me human. She hurt me so much when she left I wanted to kill myself. I still kind of do, especially after I feel the way she treats me when we text now. The person you used to kiss every morning and stare into their eyes is now a stranger. A stranger who is annoyed by your presence but tolerates you out of some obscure social obligation. Hurts to be so foreign to a person who loved you so much. She taught me to love, i don‚Äôt want anyone else now, but I hope that if I ever do, no I pray, that I remember these 5 years, what they felt like, and what it cost me when it blew away like ashes into the wind. I pray I remember how much she meant to me, so that I don‚Äôt throw away love like this again. ",asktransgender
They Will Never Win,"What can they do to us that has not already been done? Will they spit at us and scorn us in the streets, throw us from their homes and family? Because they've already done that for thousands of years.

&amp;#x200B;

Will they deny our existence? They are already doing it as we speak.

&amp;#x200B;

Will they call us insane, liars, perverts, possessed, heretics, devils? All of this, I know you see, is pointless, because here we are still after hundreds of years of being put to the stake and crucified and pushed from the cliffs into the sea below.

&amp;#x200B;

So what more can they do? Because you must recognize like I do that no matter how much hate they gather in their tiny hearts and expel from their mouths it's pointless: they will never win. Look at how they've gathered their hate over thousands of years, how near and far they've spread their vitriol to stamp out every last remaining trace of our kind, and yet here you and I are with hardly any effort on our parts. They must spend every last dime they own to force us from existence, yet all we have to do is *be* and suddenly all their efforts are pointless.

&amp;#x200B;

They say we do not exist, but we say that we do -- and it is stronger.

&amp;#x200B;

They say we are lunatics and liars, perverts and possessed, but all we have to do is turn away and suddenly their words lose all power like a broken medieval charm.

&amp;#x200B;

They say that they will stamp us out, shun us beyond all recognition and shame us until we are laid low like louses, yet all we have to do is turn up our chins and they are silent; they have nothing left to control us with. They have nothing because no petty words or tiny pieces of paper can ever, will ever, compromise who we are and how we are meant to be in this world. They will fight with hatred? We would fight with nothing, yet even still, it would be stronger than every inch of hatred they could muster against us.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you're still worried, then look around: what do you see? Tens of thousands of bright individuals in this subreddit alone who have survived and are surviving, even after all the hardship, denial, and strife they've endured in their lives and the lives before them. 1.4 million Americans who have done the same. Countless others who are living across the globe at this very moment. And against us: many people who will become very, very embarrassed when they learn how poorly they've treated us if they only live long enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Because let's get this straight: you are here, right now, the exceptional man or woman or anyone in between that you are and absolutely no one else, no matter what anyone says or tries to trick you into believing. And by trying to say something different, by trying to pretend that we're anything other than who we are, their bigotry is sealed: they have already lost.",asktransgender

What i mean by trap: A trap is someone who purposely or accidently presents as another gender, but overall is comfortable with their assigned sex and doesn't have gender dysphoria.  NOT a transgender woman, another word that could be used to replace the word trap in this main post and outside the edit would be transvestite

&amp;#x200B;

my first question is the part of gender identity, i currently identify as a trap/hyperfeminine male (as u can see im a guy who likes acting like a girl and stuff)  and recently my friend and i were talking about our story of finding out gender identity, and to her mine sounds more similar to a closeted transgirl (one reason i consider myself a trap is because it feel more right to me) and such like . im curious to see what your guys story are since im currently in  a position where i dont know where i stand and such (please dont take offense to me using guys to this subreddit as a whole)

&amp;#x200B;

2nd question, in my opinion, traps are a type of transgender since transgender can be used as a umbrella term, i feel that traps can be considered a ""relative"" to drag queens due to the nature of it (however traps can be used to say u look like a girl when ur not trying to which can be considered an insult) so my 2nd question is, do you think that traps should be considered a type of gender, or do you believe that its solely a derogatory term, or do u believe that it is okay in certain contexts and can even be considered a compliment in some? feel free to post you opinion and please do explain your though process, i personally dont understand why some people think trap can be considered a derogatory term but im willing to see why

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: here is where im going to explain why im a trap or consider myself atleast at the time of posting, i am a trap from one characteristic, i dress up as a girl every so often and my mannerisms online are akin to those of a girl. when i trap i feel much ""free"" and i dont feel like uncomfortable in my body (partially due to my feminine figure and other feminine features) of course i have the issue of being told i was supposed to be growing up as a girl so being a trap could be a way of getting that guilt off of me, i also for some reason prefer people treating me like a girl online since it makes me feel better, but i dont if thats considered a closeted transgender or trap, so i opt for the latter

I‚Äôm doubting a co-workers claims that they are transgender. Am I a bad person?,"So I‚Äôm transgender, and I recently found out an old co-worker of mine is also trans. We‚Äôre both AMAB which is important to explain my predicament. While they no longer are employed at my place of work (for reasons that I will discuss later), I‚Äôve learned from a few friends and eventually through Facebook that my old co-worker (for the sake of anonymity let‚Äôs just call them ‚ÄúM‚Äù) identifies as a women. They‚Äôve begun presenting as a women in public, using gender-neutral and female pronouns, and I believe they are on hormones, however I‚Äôm not entirely sure.

Now M is not a good person, and from my experiences is a horrible person to work with. They were rude, invasive, made many inappropriate and offensive comments, and treated both customers and co-workers poorly.

Now this has absolutely nothing to do with them being transgender, you can be a bad person and be transgender. I‚Äôve always stood by my beliefs that it never invalidates the way you feel about yourself and how you identify. However, the situation is a bit more complicated with M.

M was fired for sexual harassment. There has been many times where they made unwanted sexual advances on women in the workplace, and as I‚Äôm not out to anyone at work and present myself as male, they would try to engage in the typical ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù you hear all the time in the workplace. Some of the things M said about women were absolutely horrible. All this happened before M came out as transgender. 

Recently I‚Äôve been overthinking this entire situation. I‚Äôm a huge supporter for everything lgbt (of course I am since I‚Äôm part of the community being both bi and trans) but I can‚Äôt help but feel at odds with M. I have trouble understanding how someone can identify as a women, yet attempted to dehumanize other women nearly every chance they get. I‚Äôm sure there are cis women out there who sexually harass and treat other women poorly, but if it‚Äôs to this extent it must be incredibly rare.

Basically, I‚Äôm doubting the sincerity of M‚Äôs claims that they‚Äôre transgender. And just typing that out makes me feel  sick. I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm actually here invalidating someone‚Äôs identity. I strongly believe that if you have doubts about your gender identify or that if you experience gender dysphoria  then your gender identity may not align with your birth sex. But when it comes to M I have trouble accepting that someone so misogynistic can identify as female.

Am I a bad person for feeling this way? Is this some form of internalized transphobia? I really want to believe that M is genuine, and I want to be happy for them even if I dislike them as a person. I just have no idea how to feel about the situation and overthinking it is making me very uncomfortable.

(EDIT)

I should clarify that I am not absolutely certain that they were fired for sexual harassment. As I said in one of the comments, it‚Äôs not like I read the report or anything. HOWEVER, there have been multiple people that have came to me personally and said that M made unwanted sexual advances towards them, and based off their previous behavior it‚Äôs not unlikely to believe this is why they were fired. It could just be a rumor that this is why they were fired, and I apologize if I spread this rumor by not clarifying, but is is most likely true based of their previous actions and the multiple people who have said they sexually harassed them.",asktransgender

A Partial how to for Starbucks transgender care coverage with insurance.,"Ok trans friends Ive been testing the starbucks health insurance system to see how it works so I can write a how to. So far I know that after 2 months of ~20 hours a week I have been offered insurance. They have a trans advocacy desk you can reach by calling 18668497103 and asking for a trans care specialist(they will ask personal info to determine if you are an employee, don't call unless you are). 

I am waiting on a list of Drs. that are in network for each of the options they have for providers. Aetna, BCBS, Cigna, and United. I should have that list next monday, and ill update this post or make a new one. 

Only therapy, endo, hrt, top and Bottom surgery are covered by the plan you choose. Everything else (face, voice, hair removal, BBL etc) are covered by the starbucks supplemental insurance. There is a separate process for those things. You will submit the Dr. referral to the primary insurance be denied and send the referral and denial to the trans support desk. 

They have a list of for example Drs for each that are covered in full(minus copay I assume). So far I do think starbucks part time is worth it for any of you who need these things covered. My bi weekly cost is 19 dollars with an in network copay of ~3000. I could instead pay ~40.00 and the copay is ~750.00",asktransgender

2 Year wait times...?,"Throwaway account bc I post frequently on my main account and don't want to risk harrassment...

Basically I came out as transgender to my family this past week (most of my friends have known for a while). This is after I'd been struggling with Dysphoria for over 10 years and after many years of considering all the possibilities and options I had, I came to the conclusion that becoming a woman was the only way to solve it. So people close to me had to know.

Yesterday I finally started the official process by seeing my GP and asking him to refer me to a gender clinic, here in the UK. It felt like such a huge step and so surreal that the rest of my life was finally starting to begin - I will be a woman someday.

However, I've just found out (from the clinic website) that the average wait time for first appointment is 18-24 months... My dysphoria is worse than ever now that people know who I really am and I don't end to surpress it. I know after 10 years 2 more should seem very menial but that was 10 years of uncertainty. And now I know I've never wanted anything more, yet it's still so far away.

I can't spend two more years feeling trapped inside this body. Resenting everything about myself physically and just feeling wrong. I always said if I made this decision I'd go through the right channels, but knowing this I don't know if I could wait that long...

I suppose my question is what do I do? I know I can't just decrease waiting times so how so I deal with my (even worse) dysphoria?

Is there a way to make these feelings go away besides transitioning/undergoing HRT?,"Thanks for listening to anyone who reads this. Just wanted to vent some thoughts.  

Three years ago, I began questioning myself at 19. Some good people of this sub helped me out and listened to my rambling. Eventually I went as far as to buy myself DIY hormones after various therapists did not work out. I let the hormones run out and did not buy more. There were some effects I noticed and it felt pretty good, but I guess I was too much of a coward to face the music at the time. 

I wallowed in self pity and depression for a while, and I've just begun to dig myself out of this hole. (Interviewing for jobs, eating better, exercising daily, etc.) I was interviewing for a receptionist position the other day and it was great until the interviewer said ""You'll be our first male receptionist!"" I don't know exactly why, but this sentence must have triggered me because I cannot stop thinking about it and I'm feeling those same feelings I did three years ago. Basically an intensely uncomfortable feeling that something is not right and every part of my body is screaming ""I want to be female."" 

So...I guess this brings me to my question. **Has anyone found a way to successfully ignore these feelings?** Because every time I've tried to move forward in my life, something is always in the way and it really seems like this is the main issue. An unending uncomfortable feeling that something isn't right between my body and my mind.

Yes, these thoughts would be better addressed to a therapist and perhaps I will go to one again soon. ",asktransgender

Reasons why people stopped hormones?,"So ive been on hormones for about a month and a half and i am wondering whether to continue. Just to be clear im not doubting identity stuff just about whether hormones are producing the chnages that i want. I identify as non binary and started hormones because i thought i wanted the physical and the emotional changes. I have really enjoyed them but i guess i am wondering if this is the path i want to go down - realising now that i am going to likely look like a guy with breasts for quite a while and possibly forever. Not exactly the way i had expected the changes to occur. Im ok with having breasts but I guess the implications of that for my life im starting to consider with a bit more weight.

I am considering stopping hormones for a bit to see how i feel and if the emotional changes are really that great.

"What qualifies as ""strong desire"" (from DSM-V)","So this isn't for any gatekeepery purpose, just for myself trying to figure things out, but I'm sure we're all across the DSM-V definition of gender dysphoria as experiencing any 2 of the following for at least 6 months:

* A strong desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be treated as a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A significant incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's sexual characteristics
* A strong desire for the sexual characteristics of a gender other than one's assigned gender
* A strong desire to be rid of one's sexual characteristics due to incongruence with one's experienced or expressed gender
* A strong conviction that one has the typical reactions and feelings of a gender other than one's assigned gender

So my question is what exactly constitutes ""strong desire"" here? Is it debilitating intrusive thoughts? Is it just persistent longing? Or something else? Because if you hang out in places like r/egg_irl or take the old ""cis people don't question"" thing too literally you'd think that any tiny inkling of wanting to be another gender == dysphoria/trans. Whereas according to the DSM it sounds like you could pretty legitimately desire this stuff, but if it's not ""strong"" then it's no biggie.

For those that didn't have that much specific physical dysphoria (ie: points 3 &amp; 5 above), how did you experience that kind of desire before cracking?",asktransgender

Being Forced to Detransition,"I met my straight boyfriend before I knew I was trans. We started dating and I came out as genderfluid and he stayed with me. About a year later I came out as transmasculine. He said he still loved me and has been very supportive. But he isn't as affectionate and I can tell he's not attracted to me. I asked him repeatedly if I was too masculine for him and he always said no, until recently. He finally admitted he wasn't attracted to me because I'm a man.

&amp;#x200B;

He has said he supports me and wants me to be who I am, but when I talk about it further he talks about me finding a new boyfriend. So I've had to decide between being a man and having my boyfriend, and I chose him. He's the only person I have in my life. Both of my parents died of cancer and the rest of my family refuses to talk to me. So if I want to stay with him I have to detransition and go back to being a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

I've cried every single day since deciding to detransition. I told myself I'd buy women's clothes on November 1st and donate all of my men's clothes. Until then, I would enjoy my final days of being a man. Instead I've been miserable thinking about being a woman. I'm so incredibly bad at it, I feel like a failure of a woman when I try. I can't stand in high heels, I feel like a clown when I wear makeup, I don't know anything about women's fashion, and least of all I don't know how to act like a woman. Imagine Chuck Norris wearing an ill-fitting dress and doing his own makeup. That's how I feel presenting as a woman. Pathetic, disgusting, and laughable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to find other people who were forced to detransition so I can have support. What little information I can find is about people who WANTED to detransition. My only friend is trying to help me but there's not much he can do as a cishet man. I need to learn how to be a woman but I don't know where I could learn. The only people in my life are said friend and my boyfriend, both cishet men. Before my Mom died she didn't teach me anything about being a woman. I never learned how to use makeup, how to straighten my hair, any of the things all the other girls growing up were so good at. If I could learn how to properly be a woman I'd feel so much better.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend suggested just being a masculine woman, but that's basically what I am now, I've only socially transitioned. I pretty much look like a butch lesbian -- short hair and men's clothing. But even that small bit of masculinity is too much for my boyfriend to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound trans to you (MTF),"Alrighty, so my story takes place over the course of a few years. 

One of my early memories was when I was around five or six years old, I remember walking through target with my mom and her boyfriend when I looked at my mom‚Äôs purse and thought ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt boys get to have purses? Don‚Äôt they want to carry things too?‚Äú that question stuck for a bit. Around this same time was when I always wanted the girls toy from McDonalds. My mom had offered me one day and I went for it. I did every time. one day my my moms boyfriend took me through and forced me to get the boys toy. I cried, I cried so hard.. I was never too interested in boy toys. Sure, I loved legos, but legos arnt something im going to go putting a gender label on. Legos are basically creativity. And as far as the other toys id rarely touch them, there‚Äôs also Spy Gear I used to play with but then again.. MY STUFFED ANIMAL CAT FAMILY HAD DEEP MEANING TO ME. 

I never liked (and still don‚Äôt) to get haircuts, I always fight my parents when I came to a haircut.  And I was always a good kid.

On and off throughout life my name sounded weird to me, I always thought (more noticeable in later years) it sounded weird to introduce myself using my birth name.

I‚Äôd play dress up with my step-sister in my younger years. She‚Äôd paint my nails and I‚Äôd like it, my mom didn‚Äôt so much, but I did 

Later on came 5th grade, the puberty video. It was towards then end of the day. Everyone got separated based on gender. I watched it and laughed with the other boys (they were real immature about explaining things). Then few minutes after it was over it hit me. I was freaked out by puberty. I freaked out for awhile.

Then came puberty. I noticed myself developing body hair and realized it had started. I ran to my room and cried. I was freaked out for months, it was trauma. I‚Äôd pray every night to ‚Äúskip puberty‚Äù. Every wish was to skip puberty. 

Years went by and my eyesight got a little worse. I was too self conscious to wear glasses. 7th grade I remember liking some of the girls frames. I loved my English teachers (she‚Äôs younger, so not old frames either)

The boys locker room wasn‚Äôt the best either. I wanted to be alone to change. One day I was with a group of them in a game we were playing, we had won and we‚Äôre celebrating. The bell rang and I headed off to my next class. I got there and thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs.. something different about me..‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what. 

This is around middle/high school time too, Around this time I also started having odd thoughts of getting rid of my male genitals, these thoughts would often be around over summer vacation 
It was around 8th and 9th grade, I‚Äôd be interested in the girls clothes, mostly tank tops, wishing I could wear them.


During summer vacation I was staying at my grandparents house. Suddenly I  wanted to try wearing a bra. Like, I felt like I should be wearing a bra. I took a bath  in the jacuzzi just for the chance to try one on while It was filling up. I took it off right away just Because of looking in the mirror. 

Few years later we get to the now. 
I started seeing a therapist due to depression and anxiety. She noticed how I sat with my legs crossed. Had longer hair. The higher pitched voice that I have (I‚Äôm 17 and still refuse to speak in lower tones, so my voice comes out squeaky) and the fact that I‚Äôd play with my hair. She brought it up with me, and kind of explained it. I got happy, like really happy! I left that appointment happy, I went home and started looking for signs. 
 Since then my and my therapist have kinda talked about it, she called me Colleen once and for like two seconds I felt on top of the world! 

I‚Äôm a mess right now.  But does it sound trans to you? Anything relatable? I‚Äôm just looking for answers so anything is appreciated! Thank you!",asktransgender

Outed to my likely transphobic father.. I don't know what to do.,"I'm an MtF closeted trans woman.. at least I think I am.. and I've been in a cycle of doubt, disassociation, and acceptance and it's been killing me.. My father, who I only see on Sunday but call a few times during the week noticed something was wrong but since he has verbally made anti-trans jokes in the past and is a bit racist, I couldn't trust him.

I recently told my grandmother who I thought I could trust.. She promised she wouldn't tell anyone, but yesterday my father called and asked her.. and she told him that I ""wanted to be a girl"".

I'm not even close to being ready for him to know and now he knows... I'm terrified to talk to him now because out of the four of his kids.. I'm the only one assigned male at birth, and he does not seem to be the accepting type. Although he's an alcoholic.. I love him and I'm terrified to lose him and I'm the only one of his kids that are in contact with him.

I'm terrified for both his sake and my sake.. I don't know if he's going to out me to anyone else or if I'll lose him. I need to talk to him soon, but I have no idea what to say. No one in my family knows besides one of my sisters, my grandmother, and now him.

I should add that he was totally against my older sister when she questioned if she was lesbian and he flipped out. If I fully come to terms that I'm female.. then I'm lesbian too which makes things harder.

"Anyone else feel really, really alone right now?","So I'm sure pretty much everyone has heard about the Trump administration's latest bullshit regarding trans people. It's definitely a sign of worse things to come, and if nothing else is proof the administration doesn't value our humanity in the least, and that millions of people support this.

I don't think this would worry me as much if I was hearing anything other than crickets chirping from all the cis people in my life. I'm living in a house with 4 of my family members, most of whom follow the news pretty closely, and not one of them has brought it up at all. My facebook feed is silent aside from one trans person I'm fb friends with. Only a few cis people on my twitter feed have retweeted anything regarding it while most of the trans people I follow are definitely worried/pissed/etc. I don't expect every single person I know (or even most people I know) to be yelling about this, but this is the sort of thing that ideally would face a ton of backlash and yet barely anyone who isn't trans seems to care.

My family is left-leaning and was accepting when I came out, but every time I bring up my fears about 45's administration affecting my life as a trans person I'm met with ""you're overreacting"" or ""no, we're all equally in danger""(bullshit). How am I supposed to talk to them about this? I barely have any trans friends at all and all the people who are closest to me are cis. No one in my life understands what it's like going through the world knowing an overwhelming portion of the population not only openly hates your guts but denies your very existence, and that the federal government would rather you be dead than be who you really are.

"DAE make the mistake of picking a ""gender neutral"" name for transition only to regret it later?","So, When I transitioned ages ago, I legally changed my name to one that was ... ""gender neutral"" a name that could go either way... it made the process a lot easier as I was able to get that started before I completely transitioned (though not much since I started transition only a couple months afterward)  


Still, it seemed to smooth things over .. I never really cared overly much for the name.. I started using a nickname due to participation in the ""Society for Creative Anachronism"" where folks often create a ""persona name"".. over the last 25 years that name has come to mean more to me than my ... ""transition name"" ever did.  


I finally worked up the guts to fix that.. Today I filed paperwork to change my name legally to the one I've been using for 25 years with anyone who calls me a friend... and I kind of look back at that ""picking an easier transition name"" as a mistake I made because it caused the usual amount of ""not sure if boy or girl name"" confusion in lots of cases... and just never really made me overly happy.  


Wondering about other peoples experiences.

  
Also to note: I had my original birth records adjusted and sealed after surgery years and years ago. I was told that legally I could check the ""never changed my name"" box on legal forms.. but I was concerned about not causing red flags or committing perjury on my forms... So, I talked to an attorney friend and he told me to check / fill out as my official documents currently show and add an addendum for the judge's eyes only where I explain full disclosure and request that this part of the application be sealed...  


When I got to the court house, the clerk told me that she could not keep the addendum private.. that it had to be scanned in and would thus technically become part of the record... so I told her why and she said ""fill it out this way... and I'll keep the addendum without scanning it and talk to the judge and will only scan it in if he insists.. and he likely won't because he's very understanding with these issues""  


So just a huge shout out to a certain clerk of courts for being super helpful and understanding!

She recommended going to patches or injections if I manage to metabolize more than the 6mg of estradiol that she is now prescribing me, but that seems unlikely due to their increased cost and my current fights with my insurance company.

I wanna put these skills to good use, and by good use I mean I want to inspire other trans people so that they will be bold and brave, and live the lives they want to live, and not live in fear.

That's my main goal BTW: I believe fear is our biggest enemy, and I want people to know they don't have to be afraid.

I wanna help people know that we are valid, that things can be okay, that there is good in the world, and that we will get through whatever storm it is no matter scary it looks.

So, I thought a YouTube channel could be a good way to do that. And while I have no trouble speaking in public, recording videos, editing, etc., I'm not sure how to go about it exactly.

I know that the best I can do is talk about the subject in a voice that makes people know things *can* be alright. I think my main job is in the tone and the energy, and not exactly in the particulars of what I'm gonna be talking about. And the latter is actually what I need help with:

- What are the things you wish to see talked about? 
- What are topics you wish you had come across when you first started down this journey? 
- Is there something I'm obviously missing here?
- What is the best use of my time?

Here are some ideas so far:

- How does HRT work?
- How has HRT worked for me?
- How did the surgeries I had went?
- How does dysphoria usually manifests? How does it manifest for me?
- How to come out without putting yourself in danger?
- What happened to my marriage after I transitioned?
- Expenses you're looking at when you start transitioning.
- Being trans and your professional life.
- A ""for the allies"" section where I address people who know nothing about the subject‚Äîe.g. your mom‚Äîand explain things to them.
- How did I learn I'm non-binary?
- Dating as a trans person.

What do you think?

Any and all feedback is appreciated, and apologies for the huge wall of text.

And before you ask:

- I don't care about revenue, I care about impact and doing what's best for people.
- I don't care about getting flak either. I know there'll be haters, I can deal with that, and unless I'm actually murdered it's fine. Where I live it's very unlikely that that'll happen.
- Yes, I'm trans myself. HRT for years, surgeries, the whole spiel.",asktransgender
Sharing my story- insight requested,"So, I'm an 18 year old woman. I like feminine things,like to get compliments for looking pretty, have 90% female friends, am heavily involved in campus feminism, etc. I'm in a very male dominated major so I take some pride in being one of the only women.  

But when I was 15 or so, I was completely sure that I was a trans guy. I learned that tesosterone and surgery actually existed, and to me that seemed really amazing. I spent hours on trans sites. I told my guidance counselor, some friends, and my family. But no one was really accepting. So I went back into the closet and like...I was fine? I got over it and got busy with other stuff. 

But now I'm secretly really worried that maybe I'm not cis despite acting like I am. If I got turned into a guy tomorrow via magic or something, I'd be thrilled. I still spent time on trans sites and I'm so jealous of the handsome trans men.  I'm active with the campus LGBT group but....I've never told anyone how I really feel. And I don't know how to because everyone sees me as a really feminine girl. 

How do I find out if I'm trans? Where is the line between cis and trans? ",asktransgender
Need Help With My Hair - I Have High Widows Peaks!,"I'm a 31-year-old trans-female. While I haven't been out very long publicly, I have an extensive history of crossdressing and crossplaying at geek conventions. Since my teens I can remember my hair being very unusual in my opinion. It's super thick and fast growing below the ridge, however, the top is very thin and slow growing. I've had a lot of people try telling me that I'm going bald, however, that's doubtful since my hair hasn't changed very much since my early teens and my recent hormone lab test showed that my DHT levels were at their lowest for an adult male. I was called bozo-the-clown quite a few times.

[https://imgur.com/a/WY2gjEd](https://imgur.com/a/WY2gjEd)

I have my mother's hair, super curly and easily breaks, the only difference being she isn't thin on top as I am. About two years ago (earliest efforts of me coming out) I began to grow my hair out. I've mostly kept it in a ponytail ever since but at last check, it's roughly down to my shoulders. The bad news is; I have high widows peaks and everything is all the more noticeable when my hair is long. The top/front is so thin that I can barely find any confidence to going out or taking pictures in female mode without putting my favorite wig on. So I have questions and would like to know a few things!

**What can I expect from HRT?**

They claim HRT ""can"" stop/slow hair loss and that I shouldn't expect lost hair to regrow but what I've noticed when I look in the mirror is a large amount of peach fuzz that extends from my widows peak to a more natural hair line. I also have peach fuzz on my thin area too.

* Can I expect HRT to signal my peach fuzz to grow in like normal hair?
* Are there any products that can force peach fuzz hair to thicken - including prescription strength ones?
* What are other trans-woman's experiences on HRT and their hair?

I understand I shouldn't hold out very much hope, especially with that obvious thin area towards the back.

**Wigs:**

* There is a Youtuber I watch who also has high widows peak much like mine but she wears a type of hair toupee to give herself bangs and little more hair where it matters. Should I consider having to do the same?
* One friend of mine told me that she knows a couple transgender friends who exclusively wear wigs. What are your experiences with wigs? Are they passable or should I put more strive into my natural hair?
* Would anyone have suggestions for wigs that are a step above cosplay wigs - high quality, passable, and hopefully easy on the budget?

**Lastly:**

* Can anyone suggest hair styles that would look endearing and work while I wait for thicker hair?
* And whatever else anyone can say to help, this is makes me self-conscious about how well I'll past later and I feel it ages me in all the wrong ways.

Thanks for the feedback. I really hope my hair isn't a complete lost cause.",asktransgender
Nipple Discharge on Spiro - Is this bad?,"I've been on Spiro for about three months, and have had it as my only medication. Starting last week, I noticed soething different with my nipples. Each of them felt like they had gained tissue. My left nipple has definitely gained more than my right. It feels almost as if there is just more nipple directly underneath the surface. This means that my left nipple feels...pinchable and tweakable, while my right nipple is somewhere in between my left and a standard dude nip in size. I was investigating this, touching them, and I realized that it actually felt kinda good to touch the things, when it hadn't previously. It's as if the tissue is now tender. This feeling is entirely localized to the nipples and nowhere else on my breasts. There isn't any chafing that I've noticed.

So what follows is me, every once in awhile, absentmindedly fondling my nipples in private. Then, yesterday morning, I noticed that upon messing with my nips, a very small amount of clear fluid came out of them. I tried several more times throughout today and confirmed that yes, this is happening. I managed to get a small drop of the stuff with a hard squeeze, and it tasted kinda sweet. I tried again today, and it's still going on. My left nip also produces more fluid than my right.

So is this just a result of gynecomastia from Spiro? Is it breast cancer? Some other third thing? Anyone else had this? Any advice?",asktransgender

Trump Administration Eyes Defining Transgender Out of Existence,"From: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a governmentwide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law.

A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs, including in education and health care, recognizing gender largely as an individual‚Äôs choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth. The policy prompted fights over bathrooms, dormitories, single-sex programs and other arenas where gender was once seen as a simple concept. Conservatives, especially evangelical Christians, were incensed.

Now the Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education programs that receive government financial assistance, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times.

The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined ‚Äúon a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.‚Äù The agency‚Äôs proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with, according to a draft reviewed by The Times. Any dispute about one‚Äôs sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing.

‚ÄúSex means a person‚Äôs status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth,‚Äù the department proposed in the memo, which was drafted and has been circulating since last spring. ‚ÄúThe sex listed on a person‚Äôs birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person‚Äôs sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.‚Äù

The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize themselves ‚Äî surgically or otherwise ‚Äî as a gender other than the one they were born into.

Understand the issues beyond red and blue.

‚ÄúThis takes a position that what the medical community understands about their patients ‚Äî what people understand about themselves ‚Äî is irrelevant because the government disagrees,‚Äù said Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration and helped write transgender guidance that is being undone.

The move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers, large and small, to exclude the population from civil rights protections and roll back the Obama administration‚Äôs more fluid recognition of gender identity. The Trump administration has sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military and has legally challenged civil rights protections for the group embedded in the nation‚Äôs health care law.

Several agencies have withdrawn Obama-era policies that recognized gender identity in schools, prisons and homeless shelters. The administration even tried to remove questions about gender identity from a 2020 census survey and a national survey of elderly citizens.

For the last year, health and human services has privately argued that the term ‚Äúsex‚Äù was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

Roger Severino, now at the Department of Health and Human Services, was among the conservatives who blanched at the Obama administration‚Äôs expansion of sex to include gender identity.

Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to answer detailed questions about the memo or his role in interagency discussions about how to revise the definition of sex under Title IX.

But officials at the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that their push to limit the definition of sex for the purpose of federal civil rights laws resulted from their own reading of the laws and from a court decision.

Mr. Severino, while serving as the head of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, was among the conservatives who blanched at the Obama administration‚Äôs expansion of sex to include gender identity, which he called ‚Äúradical gender ideology.‚Äù

In one commentary piece, he called the policies a ‚Äúculmination of a series of unilateral, and frequently lawless, administration attempts to impose a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman on the entire nation.‚Äù

‚ÄúTransgender people are frightened,‚Äù said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, which presses for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. ‚ÄúAt every step where the administration has had the choice, they‚Äôve opted to turn their back on transgender people.‚Äù

The Department of Health and Human Services has called on the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù agencies that enforce some part of Title IX ‚Äî the Departments of Education, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor ‚Äî to adopt its definition in regulations that will establish uniformity in the government and increase the likelihood that courts will accept it.

The definition is integral to two proposed rules currently under review at the White House: One from the Education Department deals with complaints of sex discrimination at schools and colleges receiving federal financial assistance; the other, from health and human services, deals with health programs and activities that receive federal funds or subsidies. Both regulations are expected to be released this fall, and would then be open for public comment, typically for 60 days. The agencies would consider the comments before issuing final rules with the force of law ‚Äî both of which could include the new gender definition.

Civil rights groups have been meeting with federal officials in recent weeks to argue against the proposed definition, which has divided career and political appointees across the administration. Some officials hope that health and human services will at least rein in the most extreme parts, such as the call for genetic testing to determine sex.

After more than a year of discussions, health and human services is preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year, Trump administration officials say. If the Justice Department decides that the change is legal, the new definition can be approved and enforced in Title IX statutes, and across government agencies.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the draft health and human services proposal. The Justice Department has not yet been asked to render a formal legal opinion, according to an official there who was not authorized to speak about the process.

But Attorney General Jeff Sessions‚Äôs previous decisions on transgender protections have given civil rights advocates little hope that the department will prevent the new definition from being enforced. The proposal appears consistent with the position he took in an October 2017 memo sent to agencies clarifying that the civil rights law that prohibits job discrimination does not cover ‚Äúgender identity, per se.‚Äù

Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, an advocacy group, called the maneuvering ‚Äúan extremely aggressive legal position that is inconsistent with dozens of federal court decisions.‚Äù

The agency‚Äôs proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with.

Health and human services officials said they were only abiding by court orders, referring to the rulings of Judge Reed O‚ÄôConnor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth, Tex., a George W. Bush appointee who has held that ‚ÄúCongress did not understand ‚Äòsex‚Äô to include ‚Äògender identity.‚Äô‚Äù

A 2016 ruling by Judge O‚ÄôConnor concerned a rule that was adopted to carry out a civil rights statute embedded in the Affordable Care Act. The provision prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in ‚Äúany health program or activity‚Äù that receives federal financial assistance.

But in recent discussions with the administration, civil rights groups, including Lambda Legal, have pointed to other court cases. In a legal memo presented to the administration, a coalition of civil rights groups wrote, ‚ÄúThe overwhelming majority of courts to address the question since the most relevant Supreme Court precedent in 1998 have held that antitransgender bias constitutes sex discrimination under federal laws like Title IX.‚Äù

Indeed, the health and human services proposal was prompted, in part, by pro-transgender court decisions in the last year that upheld the Obama administration‚Äôs position.

In their memo, health and human services officials wrote that ‚Äúcourts and plaintiffs are racing to get decisions‚Äù ahead of any rule-making, because of the lack of a stand-alone definition.

‚ÄúCourts and the previous administration took advantage of this circumstance to include gender identity and sexual orientation in a multitude of agencies, and under a multitude of laws,‚Äù the memo states. Doing so ‚Äúled to confusion and negative policy consequences in health care, education and other federal contexts.‚Äù

The narrower definition would be acutely felt in schools and their most visible battlegrounds: locker rooms and bathrooms.

One of the Trump administration‚Äôs first decisive policy acts was the rescission by the Education and Justice Departments of Obama-era guidelines that protected transgender students who wanted to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.

Since the guidance was rescinded, the Education Department‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights has halted and dismissed discrimination cases filed by transgender students over access to school facilities. A restrictive governmentwide definition would cement the Education Department‚Äôs current approach.

But it would also raise new questions.

The department would have to decide what documentation schools would be required to collect to determine or codify gender. Title IX applies to a number of educational experiences, such as sports and single-sex classes or programs where gender identity has come into play. The department has said it will continue to open cases where transgender students face discrimination, bullying and harassment, and investigate gender-based harassment as ‚Äúunwelcome conduct based on a student‚Äôs sex‚Äù or ‚Äúharassing conduct based on a student‚Äôs failure to conform to sex stereotypes.‚Äù

The Education Department did not respond to an inquiry about the health and human services proposal.

Ms. Lhamon of the Obama Education Department said the proposed definition ‚Äúquite simply negates the humanity of people.‚Äù",asktransgender

Sneaking coming out at the inpatient day centre of a local psychward lol,"So as I have mentioned before I will be visiting the Inpatient Day centre at the psychward everyday for the next 5 weeks. I'm doing this to help with my depression. Today I had a conversation with my psychiatrist and told her about my experience during the weekend with a group of catholics and about how I came out to one of them and was not rejected and so on. She asked if I had came out to other people in Inpatient Day Centre and I said I hadn't. Then she said that I should think about coming out to these people, because my trans experiences or at least some of them are related to my depression. And tomorrow we are having movie therapy, where we will be watching some movie(each of us can choose a movie and bring it to show it to others) and when will have a discussion about how the movie relates to ourselves in one way or another. So I thought that I will bring The Danish Girl. It would serve as my coming out and I wouldn't really need to say anything more. So yeah, tomorrow will be a stressful day, but since I wasn't rejected by a very religious person, I hope these people will accept me too. Wish me luck! :D

How do you seperate dysphoria from depression?,"I wasn't depressed, at least not before I found out I might be trans. But with some time I got/am getting over it. I don't feel depressed in my day to day life. I have anxiety, about life in general of course, this whole looking at transitioning thing is  certainly not helping. But I'm not activley suicidal, or even passivley so, in my consious thoughts. But yet, this last weekend I got blackout drunk, and according to my family, started crying and saying I wanted to kms. (I dont remember much other than yelling at one of my parents for a moment). I know that when this whole questioning thing started I felt dysphoria, or at least I think I did. Out of the blue, despite absolutely everything else being fine, I suddenly felt just wholly wrong in my body, I felt like a complete alien, and my brain kept telling me that being female would fix it. But since then... nothing, or, near nothing. The worst of it ended in a few days and it tapered off in the following months. And thus, I'm scared to go forward with anything. What if it was depression all along, and my brain just latched onto this. What could happen if I got on an anti-depressant and all this went away? What about the dysphoria I felt? Will it go up? Down? Would taking anti-depressants just be treating symptoms or is the cure I needed in the first place. Please can someone help me out here I'm scared. How is it that I don't feel suicidal in my consious thoughts, but I do when all the inhibitions on my mind are let go. The dysphoria doesn't act that way.

Shall I wait to diet?,"So I've been steadily gaining weight over my HRT and at first I was worried about it, but now I'm just wondering if I should bother dieting now, or wait till a year or two into HRT. 
My reasoning is that I don't want to inhibit the hormones effects by going into a calorie deficit and the only way I can manage to diet successfully is intermittent fasting.  So would it be better to just not stress about it, and do damage control once a good amount of hormone time has passed, unless ofcourse the weight gain gets really out of hand? 
My diet isn't horrendous so I will be looking to tidy it up a little. I think the only issue is just being hungry all the time, but it's a weird hunger, as it almost feels like an absolute life or death need :P ",asktransgender

Opinion: Trans and GNC folk should treat pronoun usage more strictly.,"Shit title I know, but I'm nonbinary and often I'll hear a variation of this phrase from my friends: ""at least [person] gets my pronouns right"". Now, I get the idea behind this. I really do. It feels so nice to be referred to correctly, especially after a steady stream of misgenderings. But I think we as a community should hold the people in our lives to a higher standard.  

Using the right pronouns is basic human decency, and should be considered the default instead of a positive. Misgenderings, no matter how frequent, should be considered a negative instead of the default. We are all people. We live in a society. And we should learn to expect our identities to be respected, and anything deviating from that as disrespectful.

Then I had this thought - certainly in part due to recent events despite not living in the US - if I do remove my ovaries, and one day am forced to stop taking testosterone for one reason or another, what happens to my body?

Questions about the social aspects of gender dysphoria and being transgender.,"I have been going back and forth on whether I should write this or not. My intentions aren't to invalidate, but while trying to learn about being transgender I have come upon some aspects that I have found hard to understand.

If my questions are insensitive or inappropriate in any way I'll remove the thread immediately, nor do I intend for any follow-up questions to be seen as anything than trying to inform myself. Nor do I believe that any paradoxes about being transgender invalidates in any way people identifying as such.


With that said, I am interested to know in what regard other peoples perception plays in to your own well-being as a transgender or as someone suffering from gender-dysphoria? To what extend is it important to you that others see you as your gender and does it hurt when others misgender you unintentionally?

I'm asking because unlike sexuality, gender seems far more elusive to me, and I have heard anecdotal examples that suggest being a happy transgender isn't purely about inward perception matching outward expression, but also how other people perceive you.

The canary in the coal mine,"I've already spoken about this in other places and in replies to my last post, but I'd like to put my thoughts on this out there for consideration, now that I've sat and thought on it more.

No, this recent move from the Trump administration isn't necessarily a huge change from how things already were. We're not all gonna be fired and evicted come tomorrow, we're not all gonna be killed and eaten or anything. I understand that. This is, definitely, a scare/control tactic. But I want to argue that there's cause for further alarm. That this could be a warning for things to come.

Every single time the Trump administration has said they'd do something, or made some statement, people fell into the trap of believing that since it was a scare tactic (it was, to be fair), it wouldn't really happen. But basically without fail, not only did he follow through on his terrifying promises, they were worse than initially anticipated. And throughout history, other human rights atrocities and violations on a large scale started smaller, with the target group(s) slowly having their personhood chipped away at over time, their rights taken away bit by bit. Yes, this move isn't a ""huge"" shift from how things already were for us, but that's because this is only one step in a slow decline towards removing our personhood, and if it gets to that point, removing us from the world entirely.

I know it feels impossible, or ridiculous, but how many red flags do we need until that possibility, that danger is ""real"" enough to be worried about? I'm not saying to panic, I'm not saying the worst possible outcome is *certain*, or even that it's certain that things'll get worse at all, but this kind of thing has precedent, and while I'm not saying to start running around in terror, at least not at this point, I think it's dangerous to assume that it's not going to get worse, or that this isn't a ""big"" deal. 

Focus on what you can do right now, like voting, protesting, petitioning, spreading awareness, volunteering, getting all your information and paperwork in order as much as you can, ect........ first and foremost. And while we're doing that, let's think seriously about what we can do to protect ourselves in the event of things getting worse, and brace ourselves for those possibilities. 

**TL;DR:** Don't *panic*, necessarily, but be cautious, be vigilant, and be ready. This might not seem like a huge deal on it's own, in the grand scheme of things, but it could easily be a sort of 'canary in the coal mine', a beginning step in the process of slowly removing our personhood completely. Even if that never happens, it can't hurt to be braced in case it *does*. Because it can happen. Don't fall into the trap of believing it can't happen.

Focus on what we can do right now in the moment, but be prepared for worse. That's what i think, at least,,,",asktransgender

Saw a GP about my trans feelings and I think I completely disassociated as things started to look like reality,"Prefacing with I‚Äôve been seeing a gender lpc for the past couple months. And sorry for the long rant. 

I‚Äôve got an extensive history, but some of the major things in my life up until about 1.5 years ago was relentless verbal abuse from brother/sisters/family/school kids my entire life about my weight as a former 300lb person. I‚Äôve adopted the notion that *I am* nothing but what the scale says. It‚Äôs turned into eating disorders, and a current weight of ~150-160lb. My therapist doesn‚Äôt specialize in body dysmorphia so she doesn‚Äôt *help* me figure out what to do, but let‚Äôs me vent and bitch about it and just reaffirms that I‚Äôm more than a number. I still have trouble believing that one, but I digress. 

I‚Äôm nearly 25 and I‚Äôve been a shut in my entire life, and only in the past year have made my own decisions as an adult. Once I graduated high school I didn‚Äôt do anything except sit at the house hoping I‚Äôd just die from a heart attack. Basically I have no concept of making choices for myself aside from leaving my mothers toxic house and getting a job in the past year. 

‚Äî‚Äî

Well about 6 mo ago I had a familiar feeling of wanting to be a girl (something I‚Äôve experienced before but always shut it up because I never truly understood it, thinking maybe being overweight affected my T. (Hint: losing the weight didn‚Äôt change my mind)). But this time I couldn‚Äôt shut it up and it kept eating at me for a like 2 weeks. Called in sick quite a few days because of how fucked up I was feeling mentally. Found a therapist who specialized in gender stuff on the suggestion of a trans girl I met online. 

After ~4 months of seeing the therapist, my way of looking at myself has changed. When I look in the mirror I look less at my flaws and more at the feminine parts of my face (because my body is atrocious) and while I don‚Äôt get happy (I‚Äôm generally not a *happy* person, I have a sense of calm. What flaws I do have seem to be dampened and less impactful on my day to day. When I see/saw myself as a guy I just have a hatred for everything because nothing is right and it ruins entire weeks

She asked me almost every week what I think about the possibility of starting hormones, and I said I‚Äôd like to, but I have a lot of hesitations (mostly revolving around my self image and the possibility of me changing my mind and permanently changing my body to look even more screwed up). 

Regardless I‚Äôve more or less accepted the fact that I want to be a girl, the only reason I can come up with is I want to look cute and something about being a guy just doesn‚Äôt feel right and doesn‚Äôt fit my personality. I still struggle trying to find an actual reason.

Well finally I called a doctor she recommended. Scheduling it I was a little embarrassed, my voice is very deep and I imagine how dumb it sounded to the receptionist. I had a moment of ‚Äúwhat the fuck did I just do‚Äù after I hanged up but went about my day. 

My appt came up and I was feeling good, still embarrassed having to talk to the doctor about it all but whatever. Then she finally started talking to me about my options and I completely froze up. I‚Äôve known for months now I have an overwhelming desire to be a girl, why now would I freak out? My therapist told me a lot of people feel super happy and excited about finally getting their prescription. Me? I felt indifferent. Why would the most liberating moment (so I‚Äôve read/heard) do nothing for me? Seeing my face in a wig &amp; clean shaven makes me genuinely happy, but when the moment comes it‚Äôs nothing. 

I think the doctor sensed my hesitation and just offered to do some blood work to see where I‚Äôm at and come up with a plan later which I went through with. 

Mentally I forgot about the appointment I just had and was feeling indifferent. I went to see my therapist who I had an appointment with a few hours later and as I had to actually process what happened I broke down. Once again completely questioning what the fuck is going on in my life, how being a girl isn‚Äôt for me, etc.. She told me to just sit on it and let the feelings simmer down and set in and i dont need to figure thIs out right now. She tells me its all normal, but im afraid its not and I actually dont want to be a girl. But it‚Äôs been 4 days and I‚Äôm still numb/depressed. 

I don‚Äôt have the same type of emotions like others overwhelmingly have, I don‚Äôt have the notion *I need hormones to survive*, although I‚Äôd certainly like to look like a girl. But super girly things like dresses/makeup/jewelry aren‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm not into activism so you wont see me counter protesting outside of a PP and I don‚Äôt see myself posting on reddit telling other girls ‚Äúyou go girl ‚ù§Ô∏è!‚Äù   I‚Äôm not a flamboyant guy and i have no idea what white male privilege is. I imagine my wardrobe would look similar to my guy wardrobe, a couple of shirts, couple pairs of shorts, dress shirts for work, a pair of work slacks and a pair of jeans for when I‚Äôm feeling really adventurous, and probably some yoga pants. I just want to look like a girl, but I don‚Äôt know if I have the willpower to deal with all that comes with it. 

Why is it something can be desired so badly be unwanted at the exact same time.

Social dysphoria concerns,"I came out to myself and a couple of close friends a little over a year ago as an 18 year old ftm. I've spent a long time soul searching, wondering if i was ""dysphoric enough"" to not regret transition, something that can't happen anyway because my fiance wants a wife and kids, something I don't have the heart to take away from him [though i still constantly entertain the thought in my head].

When I'm with strangers or the friends who met me as a male, or even alone, I'm full-on passing. I'm consistently getting ""Sir'ed"" in public situations, and it makes me feel like a million bucks.

However, when I'm with my family or the few times I go to church with them, I feel very self conscious of how I present male. I feel like a disappointment, and I'm constantly aware of how the conservative Christians around me think that the ""old me"" is gone and that I've somehow let the left media ""trick"" me into defying my birth gender. For this reason I tend to present slightly more female around them, and it feels good to trick them into thinking I'm still the old me, so that I will not be shunned [Not near as good as it feels to be Sir'ed].

This concerns me, and I feel like if I was ""trans enough"" I would never present as female nomatter the situation. The fact that I'm still willing to present female around the conservatives in my life just to please them worries the shit out of me and makes me wonder if my dysphoria is just ""fabricated"" or ""a phase"".",asktransgender

Requesting input: Writing a fantasy romance story and considering a trans character,"My wife an I are both cis and we're developing a romance fantasy web comic idea. The original idea was to do an inter-species piece, with a human soldier falling in love with an exotic humanoid creature on the other side of a war. While brainstorming, we realized that it might fit the story very well to have the creature also be trans. It seems to work well for the character and at least initially seemed like an opportunity to be inclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm nervous about the idea, and maybe you can guess at why from that introduction: I'm worried that casting a trans character as a non-human will be dehumanizing. We arrived at this idea backwards, since we started from the angle of wanting an inter-species fantasy romance. My wife is excited at the idea, but I'm concerned that even if we try to be nuanced with this idea that it could be damaging.

&amp;#x200B;

We're making an active effort to educate ourselves since we're an ignorant if well-meaning cis het couple. Some of our research has been at this very subreddit. I wanted to ask for input so we can evaluate if this idea is appropriate to pursue.

&amp;#x200B;

Context for the story: We have a soldier who is striving for success and prestige in a military focused society. The society is inflexible, predatory, and values assertions of strength and pride. The soldier is cis, but he's a soft boy deep down and doesn't really fit in with his society but is striving against his nature to fit what his society expects. His success hinges on him hunting down the other major character, who is the humanoid creature. The design is the ball-park of the Qunari from Dragon Age or tieflings from DND. The creature is a member of a more peaceful society that is being targeted by the military one. It focuses on culture and science and is more socially enlightened, but is much smaller and is struggling to defend itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two characters are brought together by circumstances and have a enemies to lovers arc, culminating in the soldier turning against his country to side with the creatures. The creature helps the soldier throw off a lot of internalized toxic masculine ideas. The soldier helps the creature work through some ingrained trauma and resentment by tapping into an innate empathy and kindness that the military society tried to suppress. We want them to have a happy ending together.

&amp;#x200B;

The creature could theoretically be a trans male. This would be a setting where sex can be changed by magic but the magic involved may be prohibitively expensive or difficult to obtain. This would not be a transition story. The creature would already be comfortably established as male before the start of the story. The trans nature would likely be either implicit or just a background character element. The fact that the creature is trans would not be a reveal or a focus, but WOULD inform how the creature guides the soldier through grappling with the ways his society mistreats and others him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest red flag for me in all this is that we have a trans character who, on the surface, can be interpreted as a literal monster. It doesn't help that Qunari and Tieflings resemble demons, either. The INTENTION is to have the military society be unfairly othering another culture, likely using them as a scapegoat for other political goals. But I'm worried no matter how nuanced we try to make the character that the knee jerk  reaction will be that we are treating trans people as something other than human. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it might make sense to make the creature just another sort of human. The interspecies angle is a big part of the appeal for us and we're pretty attached to the existing character design. 

&amp;#x200B;

I figure it will be impossible to please everyone with this, but I wanted to solicit some feedback to see if we are overstepping or if we're overthinking this. Thank you in advance for any comments you might have.

"DAE Ever Get a Transdermal Patch that Just has no ""stick""","I've been using Estradiol Transdermal System patches for the last couple months... and in my first box, I got one patch that seemed to have no adhesive at all.  


I've just now gotten another patch from my second box which had a bit but just seems very tentative in terms of adhesive.   


I applied to clean, dry skin etc...  


I actually called the manufacturer and filed a report - they're going to contact my pharmacy and see if they can get me a replacement box and also going to send me a mailer so I can send them the current defective patch (I threw out the first bad one figuring 'eh, sometimes there's just a glitch in the system', but running into yet another, this is a pattern and also it's now causing me difficulty because my insurance won't let me refill early )  


Anyway, Just curious if anyone else has run into ""patch no stick"" issues (this particular one was from Sandoz which is a generic from Novartis)  


I did some reading and it seems that the adhesive and the medication are bound together so no stick means possibly messed up dose... so just slapping some medical tape on top to keep it in place isn't a viable solution from what i can tell.",asktransgender

I recently discovered Steven Crowder. He is good at making compelling arguments about controversial issues.

He recently released a video called ""There are only two genders, change my mind""

After watching most of his videos, I don't think he really wants his mind changed. 

What do you think about this? What argument would you use against him? What would you say to him if you could talk to him?

Anyone else feels like gender identity is seen as a choice? And that we are still seen as biologically our assigned at birth gender?,"I was just reading the comments about an interview of a non binary person in a liberal local news paper an I could not stop thinking that we are not making progress with focusing only on gender identity.

Gender identity is either a joke to people or they respect it but still believe we are biologically the assigned at birth gender.

An identity is fluent. I have not identified as a woman before but I do now. Does that not communicate that it is a choice? That we ""want"" to be that gender? Unless we communicate an explanation? Science has one but we seem to not want to communicate it.

I have been called a biological essentialist in the past and maybe I am. But I believe we need to fight more about the fact the we are not correctly assigned at birth because we are **biologically** not that gender. As there is no research that shows that we are but a ton of research like [this](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.007) that shoes that we are not. 

""Sex differences in cognition, gender identity and sexual orientation are programmed into our brain during early development. There is no evidence that one‚Äôs postnatal social environment plays a crucial role in gender identity or sexual orientation.""

I know that many are afraid of being determined by brain tests but we should not fear science. Only wrong conclusions from it. If brain scans will show a more feminine brain for someone who identifies as male than we just need to do more research but **not prevent transition**. But I still think that it is our responsibility to educate the general public about the fact that the brain does have a gender.

What alternative explanation about a gender identity is there? That it is partially social is still acknowledging that it is biological to some extend. That it is totally social? That contradicts the study I posted and it will male parents afraid of making a child trans...

Public Service Announcement (sort of) - Love Your Body,"I've been around here for a while.  I'm 35 and MtF, just recently started a small dose of estradiol.

I've suffered from a number of chronic physical and mental ailments during my entire adult life (which may or may not be related to my gender).

I've visited a number of different forums on Reddit, Facebook, and other web sites where people discuss their illnesses.

After well over a decade of this, I've observed many people (and myself!) despairing and hating their own bodies because they don't feel right.

I know that it's horrible suffering from gender dysphoria, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and many other ailments, but at the end of the day, we only have one body, and we may curse our luck that we were born into a body that makes us feel so wrong sometimes.

I've heard these words many times, and I've said them myself: ""I hate my body!""

It seems totally rational to be angry and hateful that we have so many problems with this vital thing that so many other people just take for granted, and I don't want to invalidate anyone's painful experiences.

However, I've found it much more productive to instead say, ""I know that there are many things wrong with my body, but I really want to take care of it as best I can because it's the only one I have.""

""I love my body.  How can I make it work better for me?""

"My disabled partner depends on me for her care, she wants me to halt my hormonal transition and I don't know what to do.","I've been with my partner over 7 years now, a year or two into our relationship she became chronically ill and now requires heaps of help just to live a semi-normal life. 

Late last year I realised that I wanted to hormonally transition MtF, she's always been supportive of my gender exploration and was really great about me coming out as a trans-woman. She (jokingly apparently) suggested that I start taking the contraceptive pills that hadn't worked out for her, which I did because I knew it was something I wanted but was anxious about talking to doctors and still somewhat gender-questioning so I thought doctors wouldn't take me seriously at all (cyproterone/ethinylestradiol pill started about November last year). 

I was really happy with how my body was changing and felt more confident about my gender having come out to my parents (they took it well), changes were slowing and pills were running out; it was making me really anxious so I knew I had to talk to a doctor. Fortunately he was really good about it and referred me to a clinic that have been really helpful, a few months back they prescribed me a more appreciable dose of cyproterone to take along-side my regular pill as an anti-androgen (apparently the usual prescription for MtFs in my country) and they're planning on putting me on the safer option of estrogen instead of the contraceptive pill in a month or so (can't remember the name but I think it's the same one used in the US).

**So here's the problem...** when I started on the higher dose of cyproterone I couldn't control my anger as well, I don't know if stressors where just piling up or if the hormones turned me into a real asshole but I started stupid arguments and said things I can't take back, the stress on her may have made her lose some of the sensation to her body and she tried to kill herself **four** times. I got really ragey and told her that I didn't want to hear when she was upset ever again, I was the only one she could trust to talk to and I just told her I never wanted to hear it because I was mad. üò¢

So what the hell am I supposed to do? I keep trying to convince myself that it won't be as bad because the change will be different/lesser but I can't know that for sure. She said that if I go through with the change it proves that I don't really care about her and that if it turns out like last time she'll make an attempt on her life while I'm out of the house unable to stop her. She has nothing to live for but me and I can't risk being such an asshole to her again but on the other hand I feel like if I don't go through with this change it'll never happen and that scares the hell out of me. I feel like whatever choice I make is just going to lead to one or both of us suffering and I don't know what to do. Does anyone have advice? Please.",asktransgender
Thought about making this post for a while now. Recently got hit with a 30 year snowball. I think today is the day I should share my experience.,"How could I not know?

Even when I was little I fantasized about being a girl. I would daydream about being forcibly feminized by the girls in my grade and remade as ""one of the girls.""

Well apparently that wasn't enough to tip me off. 

I specifically remember once that I tried to wear my sister's Snow White dress from Halloween while playing with the girl from across the street. My mom put the brakes on that real quick (although, in hindsight, my mom is pretty chill about these things and I think she would've let it happen if there hadn't been other parents over to judge) 

I started crossdressing when I was around 13. Going through the laundry and drawers to find stuff to wear when no one was home. Still I told myself that these were normal fantasies. If I was somehow to become a girl, I would just fantasize about being a boy anyway.

But that didn't always satisfy me. I even remember once making up my mind to fake my death and get a sex change when I got older lol. Still, apparently, that wasn't enough to let me know what was going on. I always thought of being trans as something separate from what was going on with me. I told myself it was a fetish. I wasn't trans. Not possible. Especially since I didn't experience what I today understand as dysphoria. I was always ok with being male. But in the deepest recesses of my mind, I knew what I would rather be.

High School was pretty typical Americana. Played football and baseball. Chased girls. Got my heart broken. All parts of growing up. I was able to put my gender identity away inside me. When I went away to college I used my new found freedom to explore the world of internet porn. Apart from there, I would never acknowledge how I felt. Even if I would crossdress on occasion when I was home on break. 

College was also typical. Did well in school. Had a ton of friends. Had plenty of girlfriends. It eventually dawned on me that I was a pretty attractive dude. I think that played into my lack of dysphoria in a way. I was able to feel comfortable and validated as a guy. 

I bring this up because if you ran into me IRL, you would probably never suspect me. Within the last year I started checking out the trans subs here on Reddit. I told myself I was just being supportive. I was just learning more about other people. I saw the memes of r/traa and became familiar with the term ""egg."" And so, slowly my own shell started to crack. 

Started following famous transwomen on Instagram. Again. Just out of support. In private I started dressing again and experienced new things like femalePOV porn. And I began experiencing jealousy of girls that I saw. 

I still had no idea apparently.

Anyway, Chanel Santini and Aubrey Kate finally burst that shell of mine lol. Something that was nearly 30 years coming. I realized I would consider doing something about my gender if I could guarantee to look that good. My shell didn't stand a chance and I finally I got hit with a snowball that spent 30 years rolling down a hill straight for me.

It was then that I thought about making this post. I wanted to tell someone. I wanted some slice of the human populace to know the truth.

This lead me to another realization though: I'm not as brave as you guys and girls. I won't be doing anything about my new found realization. My friends wouldn't understand. My family probably wouldn't disown me but it would be hard on them. I also have the love of an amazing woman and I don't want to put her through that.

Like I said. I thought about making a post like this for a while. I wanted to be honest just once. Not for myself. But I believe I owe it to all you brave men and women out there.

Today's news finally pushed me into sharing. Not because of how it will affect me. But how it will affect you. I can hide. I can adjust. But not everyone has that ability. Rather than dysphoric, I feel euphoric when I think about being who I would choose to be. It's something I have always felt. Perhaps if I was 10 years younger and could choose how I look as if I had a ""Character customization menu"" I would do something about this. But unfortunately science isn't quite there yet. 

So I'm gonna stay here. On the inside of cis society. Subtly dropping knowledge on people. Trying to get them to see transpeople as people. Never tipping my true hand. I feel like it's the least I could do in solidarity. Because in all likelihood, the only people that will ever know my truth are the people that read this post.

MTF becoming impotent and feeling bad for my GF,"I'm using cyproterone and estrogel for 2 months. I'm with my girlfriend for 6 years and wanted to transition for one year. My girlfriend told me she would be OK with it if I still could use my penis (no problem, I don't want SRS) .
But for few weeks, i don't get as hard as before. I am still able to have PIV intercourse and still enjoy it. But yesterday she wanted to try anal (me being on the top) and even after hours of trying I couldn't get hard enough.

every statistic is a story and a lifetime,"trigger warnings beware

made a throwaway account just to post this. theres just so, so much i need to get off my chest. ive been watching all of you for so long from the outside on my main account that it actually feels frightening being here, but i am desperate and i know that only you guys would understand. i am tired 

people who arent transgender will always tell you theres no rush. people in my family wanted me to get a nice degree and whatever else before starting my transition. i of course went ahead to start working so i could start it. even now people act like theres no hurry to do srs, but no one understands the dysphoria pre op and the amount of unfortunate circumstances youre exposed to while stuck somewhere in between. some will go so far as to say that we chose to be this way. no one will know how it feels to have someone at a distance from you but you cant call their name loud or there will be base in your voice. or clothing restrictions to hide certain things. or the lies you have to tell to people you love to conceal yourself if youre stealth. or to look in the mirror and hate what you see. i have DID with constant voices in my head. each time i look in the mirror i hear ""freak"", ""ugly"" etc. and lets not go on to relationships. my first relationship was a traumatic experience being abusive, physically sexually and mentally. i withdraw from relationships for a while just to find myself with an emotionally abusive man. i think part of me took it because i feel guilty about being stealth and i lied too. but fact remains that the nature of both relationships is such that i know wouldnt have happened had i been a cis female. or maybe it would, but i wouldnt have had such a bad self esteem and just take what i can get because the first relationship made me feel more validated as a woman. i have broke time and time again even when i had thought it not possible anymore because of things i had been exposed to being a pre op female. on a clean slate its already important to know you cant birth your own kids after srs , and depending on your genetic lottery you might need other ops too to experience the closest thing to a normal life. but now , i feel like too much has happened already and i have incurred damages that will last me well after srs too. i am so tired i just want it all to end, but i have such a loving god sent mother to think of so i cant , but theres not a night that goes by where i pray i wont wake up the next day , so that it wouldnt be as hard for my mom as if i commited suicide. if god exists , hes evil, i hate him for doing this and giving me a happiness deprived life. i am still very young , and instead of having a youth like everyone else that i can look back on in future and smile at , its being consumed by endless dysphoria. no one whos not transitioning will truly know the importance of srs. 

and kudos to those countries who offers it for free to us. it is most certainly a step in the right direction but i still feel the importance of it is neglected considering there are years of waiting lists. to those who complain your tax money is going to fund these, you would be grateful for it god forbid you have a child who ends up needing a procedure like this , and trust me it wouldnt seem as cosmetic then 

we see so many stastics of transgender men and women who commit suicide but forget to see that each and every one of those numbers contains a lifetime, a story, each without a happy ending. sometimes happiness isnt a choice and thats a cold hard truth. kudos to leelah acorn for actually sharing a story behind her statistic, and a big fuck you to her parents for misgendering her and calling her by a male name even in death. might as well go piss on your kids grave 

the day i make my decision, i will be sure to share my story first. the whole thing, from start to end, in hopes that people may see the full implications of being transgender. because unfortunately society is such that bad things must first happen before people pay attention. i may feel more at peace knowing that maybe, just maybe the right person/s would see the meanings in my words.

tldr; losing hope that i can be happy even after srs and i dont see a way out anymore 

edit: i thought i should be more specific and give a clear example, i guess its more for non trans people to understand in case they see these. i was raped by a paedophile in my early teen years. i wasnt close to my family and they didnt know so i didnt tell them but i felt like i needed to let it off my chest with someone. i told my cousin who was in the same school as me, we grew up together and i wasnt closer with anyone at the time. the next day i went to school and next thing i know people were talking about it and laughing at me. if i were a cisfemale, being raped wouldnt have been funny , in fact the person i trusted wouldnt feel the need to tell everyone about it either. heck, cis males get raped and its not remotely funny either, but hey if youre trans guess you dont deserve to be treated like a human. 
the experience added on to the trauma and degradation, adolescent me dissociated and started deludedly rewriting the story in my memories that it was a younger guy who did it because at least that way it would feel more validating (pretty sick i know, but thats what being trans does, some of us begin to think so little of ourselves that we do these things) ",asktransgender

I was talking to myself trying to talk me out of it, then trying to convince me to do it, bargaining to just do 1 arm etc. After 30 minutes of ranting alone like a madman I ended up convincing myself to not do it.

Like, it actively reduces my anxiety and improves my day when I see myself bleeding all over the place.  
Does this count as self harm, or is it just an unhealthy relationship with injury or something? If I were to put myself into dangerous situations to achieve this end, consciously or unconsciously, would it be self harm then?

Am I trans? (18),"Okay so I‚Äôm an 18 year old male (I think üòÇ), and I‚Äôve always kind of thought that being a girl would be better. It hasn‚Äôt been a strong thing, and I have not felt gender dysphoria. Growing up I‚Äôve always been attracted to girls, and some guys, but the weird thing is, I‚Äôve always thought being a lesbian felt most right to me, even though I‚Äôm a guy... 

Another piece of evidence is that my girlfriend is bi, which makes me kind of uncomfortable, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs bi (because I‚Äôm fine with that), I think it‚Äôs because it shows me what could be if I was a girl. It shows me we could both be girls in love, which feels so right, but instead I‚Äôm a guy. If you get what I mean... 

My attitude has pretty much been that I think I would prefer being a girl if I could just choose from birth, but that feeling is not strong enough at all to warrant a transition. I am fine with being a guy, and the amount of hassle a transition entails I don‚Äôt think can be justified by the amount I want to be a girl. I know there are some people who just know and they have such bad dysphoria and for them transitioning is the way to go. For me, I don‚Äôt mind being a guy, and although being a girl seems a bit better, the extent of which I want this is not enough to warrant the damage to relationships, awkwardness of having to come out and transition, hassle of hormones, risking the chance of regret, surgery, etc. that comes with transitioning.

I have always been turned on by the thought of being a girl as well, so I figured maybe I‚Äôm not really trans, maybe this is just a kink of mine... anyway yesterday I set out to explore my feminine side a bit. I shaved my body, I bought some cute girls underwear and girls clothes and after seeing myself like that I honesty love it. It‚Äôs like opening a can of worms. In the past day, every single picture I see of a cute girl, I just want to be them. I want to be pretty, and have soft skin, and ughhhhhh

And I almost feel sad that I won‚Äôt ever be like that... this feeling just like started today after experimenting with femininity, so I‚Äôm so confused. I really don‚Äôt know what to feel I‚Äôm super confused right now. I think I should still stand by my initial attitude of not transitioning tbh. I can probably still get these experiences without transitioning with clothes, makeup, etc. 

Tl;dr always thought being a girl would be nicer, but I have never felt uncomfortable about being a guy, and am fine with it. Decided to experiment with my femininity and loved it, and now I‚Äôm confused as hell. ",asktransgender

People keep mentioning dilation and I am confused as to what that is. I know that it is painful, it lasts forever, and that there is something (I don't know what, exactly) that needs to be done about it, but that is all.

Another is SRS depth. I may have misunderstood how SRS works, but if I am correct in my assumption, my depth would be 4-5 inches. I've heard that this might be painful during intercourse and that does worry me. Is there a way to increase that number, even if it costs more?

I'm now 100% accepting of gay rights, and I understand that it's not a choice. People are born this way. EVEN if someone doesn't act gay, it could be because of their surroundings. Maybe they act straight because they don't know what their family will think of them, or their friends. They don't want to be judged. Whatever. But deep down, you know these people have always felt a certain way.

Is that the same with being transgender? I mean I'm sure you didn't wake up and be like ""Hm... I don't want to be a man anymore today"". Did you ALWAYS feel a certain way about yourself, but just kept it hidden because maybe you felt your family or your friends would judge you negatively?

I'm posting here because obviously I'm open to having my mind changed. One of my good friends is trans. I'm taking the right steps I believe.

In short, I feel like I'm lying to my friend. Telling him that he can be a woman. And it's just... no. You are a man. You were born a man. And biologically you will always be a man.

My career or my gender identity?,"I'm 17 AMAB, and something that keeps holding me back (as I'm sure it does many people) is thinking about my future. Now, that in itself is a whole other topic, but I guess the TL;DR is: Was pressured to be a doctor all my life but have no interest, the only careers I can see myself being in revolve around fine arts, specifically acting. 

Just yesterday I talked to a family friend who has been acting for 40 years. Due to my upbringing, I never considered that acting can actually be a viable career. She told me ""Yes"". She's seen my shows, and I'm starting to get more involved within my local acting community, which is actually fairly big.

What I'm thinking is, this door has just opened: You can be an actor. You can do theatre, TV, ect. You can enjoy your career. 

Personally I have no plans on settling down, I mention that because it's usually one of the arguments, ""Oh you can't afford to raise a family as an actor"". 

But with this door opening, I feel like the door to my true gender identity is closing. Acting is already hard enough, the industry is tough. Being trans would make things even worse. If I transition soon enough, will I be able to pass? What about voice though, I couldn't do musical theatre. I'd have to pick something else.

Or, I could do what I did for ten years: repress. Repress the dysphoria, the confusion, the yearnings. But get to do this. Get to have fun. Maybe the fun will be distracting enough. Although I'd get cast in male parts, sing tenor, ect...

So I'm wondering if anyone has a similar experience, related to their career and their gender identity, who could provide some insight or advice.

Help with internalized transphobia,"In case you don't see the title, I AM TRANSGENDER! PLEASE DON'T ATTACK ME FOR BEING A BIGOT RATHER THAN HELPING ME!

I was raised as an Orthodox Jew. I was taught your gender is determined at birth, gender and sex are the same thing, you can't change your gender, along with other stuff. I used to be homophobic, too, but I got over it. I'm still struggling accepting that gender identity is real, especially nonbinary genders. I'm binary, (I'm a trans man) but I don't get how nonbinary genders work. Though I don't get how being transgender works, period. I get gender dysphoria, but I hate myself because of it and take my anger out on others. There are no therapists nearby who understand, and I can't drive, nor do I have any local friends, so those are out of the question, too. I'm very poor making under 10k a year, so I can't afford online therapists, either. I'm on T, and it has helped, but the social pressure and being around transphobia makes it really hard to accept myself. Any help? ",asktransgender

Dysphoria out of a sudden?,"Hi, some weeks ago I finally realised and admitted to myself that my identity and more importantly my gender identity doesnt fit my birth gender. In my head I now go by Thea, so nice to meet you. Before I've mostly felt euphoria by doing specific femme things, but now after coming out I've begun feeling dysphoric over some things that i havent felt before, like my facial hair. Im not even sure i want, or even can transition considering the medical gatekeeping in Norway on the whole hormone subject. Even then I've ordered my first laser appointment cus I cant stand feeling it on my face, even tho i had a full beard 3 months ago. I am being referred to a therapist for this whole thing, I guess I just need some validation or something.. I dont know, its confusing, anyway, thanks for listening to my rant and sorry for the broken english. Btw, funny thing, i used to feel dysphoric the opposite way about my gynocomastia and low t levels and tried several times to become more manly, denial maybe?

Over the past 2 years i have been increasing having transgender thaughts and fantisizing about taking hormones and becoming a woman. When i come home from work on the train i cant stop looking at womans shoes and legs and thinking how much i would like to look like that. some days it consumes me 24/7 and other days its not as bad but its always there. I look at woman and just wish i looked like them. I dont hate my body and i dont hate being a guy think i would have a much better and more fun life if i was a woman. see im quite short for a guy 5""2 and have a very small petite bone structure. i dont command respect as a guy and women dont have time for me. Im also very shy and submissive in social situations. i  think part of my desire to become a woman is because i have never had a woman show me any interest, i want to become what i want so bad but can never have. These feelings get worse the longer i go without masturbation. When i masturbate i feel like a guy again for a little while but then the feelings come back.

hair,"Hey everyone,
Just spent about 20 minutes silently sobbing on the kitchen floor. I feel so not-okay, in a very visceral way that just creeps right up on me and then suddenly I am having a full panic attack breakdown that to anyone else seems incredibly scary and irrational. I think it is because I cut my hair. I have had long hair, like past my boobs and almost to my waist long for years. I am AFAB, have been questioning, wearing binders, etc for about 6 months. plenty of eating disorder history, with one hospital stint that I told my dad was because I ""didn't want to be a woman."" 
I decided to ""go for it"" and get my hair cut because I thought I was finally ready to give up my long hair and because it's such a ""boy"" signal. But, I got scared in the chair and the stylist ended up giving me what is now basically a cute, very girlish bob. I was okay for a few days and recently have been like literally laying awake at night unable to sleep because I am thinking of my hair and when it will grow back because I am so sad it is gone. I can't stand photos of myself. I can't be on dating apps right now, like I cannot do life like this. I know the only solution is to wait. I don't want to go near a salon for the rest of my life. I don't know what happened, if this is me freaking out because I changed, because I look more fem, or because I am too scared to go all the way and chop it to full short masc-looking status. I feel like I don't recognize myself in the mirror now, and while I didn't much before, at least I had the very familiar feeling of being able to hide my face with my hair, tie it all up on my head, etc. It's like my security blanket is gone. I don't know what it means about my gender, I feel like maybe it means I am just cis and was wrong this whole time. I also know that one of the big reasons I went in to get it cut and explained to the person was that I don't like my hair to look ""neat"" and straight and shiny and silky and all the things traditionally associated with nice hair and so i just don't brush it for like a week and leave it super messy all of the time and it dreds up a bit and then I have to comb out all the knots etc etc. But that never really bothered me. It bothers other people and I think part of me knew that I would be objectively prettier and better if I had smooth clean knot-free hair and I feel like I was trying to turn myself into that thing so I would be seen as normal in a way and trying to go aggressively normal just made everything so so so so much worse for me. If I could give anyone a warning it would be to not do what I just did. I was comfortable with my long hair but thought no one would see me as masculine with it and also that if it was messy people would think I was unclean and unattractive and that somehow I needed to ""get my life together"" and fix it. I was WRONG. I don't know what to do. Everyone around me is saying I look so cute. It only makes me feel worse, I don't want to be cute. I just want to be me and I want to be safe and I don't feel either of those things and I am falling apart. Any insights or personal experiences shared would be so welcome. I hope you all are doing better than me right now&lt;3 ",asktransgender

Can I just hold off mentally transitioning and accepting who I am until my body agrees?,"MtF, pre-HRT, but I think this topic is relevant to transgender folks of all varieties and I'd value the other perspectives too. :)

I find it exhausting trying to explore the idea that ""I am a girl"" when the physical world is telling me ""OBVIOUSLY you are a sweaty hairy amorphous blob of masculinity and stoicism"". Sigh!!!

And I am really quite hesitant to try dressing up my current body because I'm fairly sure it's *not* going to be pretty and the image is going to be burned into my brain giving me an extra boost of dysphoria-on-demand.

I'm desperately craving the gender euphoria to come back, but since discovering myself as trans, coming out to a few supportive friends, and spending far too much time obsessively absorbing trans subreddits.... ahhhh for some reason the gender euphoria seems harder to get. Maybe because I'm starting to come to terms that I have gender dysphoria?

Soooooooo can I like.... go on HRT and then go back to presenting male and thinking male and just trying to be a dude again, and basically just forget about the whole thing but keep popping girl-pills, until my physical body is ready to back me up when I tell the world that this is real?

Preeeetttty sure the answer is that I'm tying too much of my identity to my physical form (and to those flashes of euphoria) and it would be healthier to accept that I'm a girl regardless of what my body says about that.... but it's just hard and I don't know how to believe it and I just haven't been getting that gender euphoria this week so I feel like a robot :(

On the plus side, I have my first gender therapist appointment today, so that should hopefully give me some paradigm shift or new perspective...

On the downside I'm terrified that I'm going to step into that appointment and emotionlessly describe what the euphoria felt like as best I can remember it.... because I'm SO good at repressing emotions I can do it without even trying.... :(",asktransgender
Working/Traveling in Russia,"Hello all,

I am an American mtf and about 9 months in. I don't really pass, but am comfortable as ambiguous presenting. 

I probably need to go to Russia for about 9 months next year for work. I have lived and worked there before and speak pretty good Russian. I absolutely understand the very serious risks of being in Russia as a trans person. I'm fairly familiar with LGBT communities there and feel comfortable as far as having a community and being able to live more or less safely there. 

I am, however, deeply unsure if anyone has advice on passing the border and obtaining (or importing) hormones while there. Does anyone, particularly non-Russians, have any experience with transporting meds or getting them there? I would have the option of traveling to Germany or Finland, too, on occasion if it is possible or easier to get them there and bring them back with me. 

I have not changed my documents yet and am unsure if I should before going. Because I have been there before, changing my name in my passport would definitively out me and could cause serious issues with the authorities. Does anyone have experience traveling to Russia after a name change, especially after having visited before? Would they automatically know if I applied with a different name that I had been there before under a male name? Do any non-passing people have experience with this?

Should I leave my current job?,"Hello everyone, my name is Serena and I am a transgender woman. So I currently work at a hardware store as an assistant manager. I have been there 5 years. I have been out full time for the past 4 months or so. My coworkers are for the most part respectful and supportive of my transition. I have been on hrt for the past 2 years and on my good days (voice and confidence) I can ""pass"" to most strangers that come in the store.

The problem that I am running into though is that I have worked at this job for the past five years. Much of that time being before I came out. So I have about 70% of customers that only see me as a man. I find it hard to be myself when I am constantly referred to as my deadname. The store and some of the customers also have a close relationship to my parents. My parents unfortunately are completely unsupportive of my transition. So it can be rather difficult when people that know my parents come in and ask me how they are. I haven't spoken to them in months.

So all of that being said I have been seriously contemplating leaving this job. There would be some benefits such as starting at a new place as myself, having more separation from parents, and also not being in a male dominated space. There would also be some negatives in leaving such as taking a cut in pay, leaving supportive co-workers, and leaving a job that is flexible with my school hours.

I am split I don't know whether it would be better to stay and just deal with the customers who knew me before or to just find a new place to work. Do any of you have any advice you could offer me? I appreciate everyone who took the time to read this.",asktransgender
I'm Conflicted about my Gender Identity,"Hello everyone, I am having a bit of a internal struggle as a male(at least I think). I've always sought my friendships around women and I think this is leading me to the thoughts I've been having recently (or it¬¥s purely coincidental, but regardless, I still have these thoughts). The thoughts I've been having are mostly about how I've been able to express myself. I.e., I'm okay with having the body of a dude, in fact I quite like it, there are a lot of aspects that I like about it, the biggest issue I've felt as of lately has mostly to do with how my views and expressions don't feel in touch with my masculinity/dudeness/gender. I'm always weirded out about how I weird I feel whenever I say or express things that might seem unmasculine to people as well as me, and I always feel like I'd be more comfortable expressing these things as a woman. These topics and issues that I've had these feelings with have always been close to my heart and I love discussing these things, but I always feel limited by my gender for how I should be expressing myself towards them. 

  
Can someone relate to what I'm saying? I'm not very knowledgable in Gender Dysphoria(at least not on a personal level, I've read about it and stuff but outside of that, I don't have any experience with it), and so I wouldn't want to draw any hasty conclusions.

Is it possible to feel comfortable with your birth-assigned gender physically but not with the spectacle you have to put up with socially?

What determines sex? Trying to learn about sexuality. Would anyone be able to help?,"Hi, I'm a straight white male diving deep into the physiology and psychology of human sexuality finding out it's *complicated*. So far I have some general ideas but honestly I wonder if I am even asking all of the right questions. Could someone help me understand what makes up sex and all its parts? This is what I have so far:  
  
&gt;**""Sex""**  
Your genitalia. Lots of conditions which can result in intersex individuals. Developed at birth, influenced by hormones, can be reassigned with surgery

&gt;**""Gender identity""**  
The gender which your brain subconsciously identifies with and accepts. Ex: man/woman/neither/both. Influences gender transitions. Determines which pronoun should be used

&gt;**""Sexual orientation""**  
The gender(s) which your brain subconsciously finds attractive and has measurable physiological effects when in a romantic setting, in close proximity, or maybe even just seen. You can be attracted to men, women, to both, neither, etc.

&gt;**""Romantic orientation""**  
The gender(s) with which you personally desire strong, intimate relationships with (or don't)

&gt;**""Sexual behaviour""**  
How one interacts with other people sexually. It's different from sexual orientation in that a priest (for example) may be heterosexual in orientation but does not engage in any sex due to their religion so is celibate in sexual behaviour

&gt;**""Gender role""**  
The way in which society categorizes and interacts with the individual. For example, a transitioning woman may still be expected to hold doors open for other woman and pay for dates if they still have outwardly obvious masculine biological features which make them appear male to society

"I feel my father is trying to dissuade me from ""being trans"" sabotaging my steps forward and trying manipulating me...","I'm sorry for the throw away, but you can understand why. 

I am writing here to put what I feel into words, and trying to see better what is happening.

Since I came out as ""possibly trans"", it seems that my father is doing a lot of things to make me feel guilt, ""love-bombing"" me, ""hoovering"" me, faking him being sick and exaggerating sickness when he is actually sick, even trying to put others against me being explicit on ""how he is suffering because of me"" and making me feel guilt for that, blaming me and making other blame me.

I think I am seeing this right... I feel that he feels threatened by me and what I am... and he doesn't want me to ""be that"" 'cause he doesn't want things to change, he doesn't want to change, he would probably feel exposed in some way I don't understand...

Since I was a child he always had issues with life in general, and always tried to control others and to boost his self-image, while suffering a lot on the inside. He does it still today, that he's almost 70. He is hugely worried about his self and being less than others.
The most scary thing is that.. he remembers me pre-realisation, he might also be an egg, according to what I see... Just, I never tried to sabotage anyone, even if I felt exposed in many cases...

I know that I cannot do anything about it, and the only thing I can do is to not being influenced by him and live my life. Also because I feel he really doesn't care about me or my family, he seems to not care about anything... just like me pre-realisation... But I can't think about it. I am doing my part, and he has to do his in his life without wanting others to be like he wants, that is NOT DO ANYTHING...

It is more though that I was expecting...

Just received HRT prescription and want to ask some health related questions,"Hello, this week I received an HRT prescription from my endo and want to double check with the community for my own peace of mind. 

My endo asked me to provide a cholesterol profile, as well as a renal and hepatic function test. He prescribed me 200mg of Spiro, two pills per day, and an estrogen shot (estradiol enanthate, which as far as I know is a form of bioidentical hormone, and dihydroprogesterone acetophenide which is a synthetic progestin). He wants me to have my bloodwork done for prolactin and testosterone after a month of treatment. As far as I know my endo is has had a lot of trans patients and is very informed on the issue, as far as being in charge of designing the public policy project that is currently being worked on for public health services here.

I have a couple of questions regarding health issues. The first is that it seems to me that the spiro dose is a high dose to start with and he didn't really give me any warnings i.e. watch out for potassium intake or anything of the like. When me and my mother asked him whether there was any possibility of a serious complication he said that there was nothing to worry about, either regarding Spiro or Estrogen. So I wanted to check if indeed I can more or less proceed with this dose without any major concerns and what side effects might I experience. I already have low energy levels and Im concerned that fatigue might render me non operational.

The other question I have is regarding the estrogen shot. I've found a few studies that compare oral, sublingual, gel and patch use of estrogen and its relationship with VTE and DVT, as far as I can tell sublingual and patch are better than oral and bioidentical safer than synthetic estrogen. But I didnt really find anything about injected estrogen. Also, I dont know if the fact that my shot has a synthetic progestin puts me at some other kind of risk.

I would very much appreciate any info, I want to be sure of the risks that come with this treatment before starting.",asktransgender

"I might possibly be trans, but I have many issues regarding starting the process. What do I do?","I am an Australian AMAB 19 year old who is currently questioning their gender identity.

Most of the issues I have concerning whether or not to start the process of transitioning come down to: 1) How I discovered the possibility of being trans, 2) My political disposition, and 3) How I identify myself now.

1) When I was about 13 years old, I discovered Gender Bent porn and since then I have only used that exclusively. I am almost not capable of climax without either explicit MTF content, or internalising the content from the perspective of the female. Obviously, the fetishistic aspect to trans issues is a sore point and I fear that this being a primary driver for starting the process will not win me any friends from either the trans or the cis communities.

2) While I consider myself to be slightly left-leaning and mostly libertarian on the political compass, I am definitely right-leaning compared to the typical transperson. Over the years I have softened up on certain issues, but some cause me particular grief about starting this process. I still associate Gender Dysphoria with mental illness, and considering my current headspace due to questioning my identity, it's hard for me to shake that. 

3) I am currently a male, so I consider myself to be a man. Even if I was to start the process, I would still consider myself to be a man until I consider myself to be androgynous enough. This ties into my political feeling, but I would not feel comfortable calling myself a woman or wearing woman's clothes until that point.

However, despite that negativity about being trans, there are a few points that push me into believing I am trans. 1) I cry myself to sleep some nights at the thought of never being a woman. 2) I have always, since I was 13, had a name I would use as a female. 3) I have ""come out"" to three of my friends recently about the possibility of being trans, though I made not indication that I would start transitioning. 4) I have experience what I believe is called here, ""gender euphoria"", after being called by said female name. 5) There has also been the standard fair in terms of gaming, I exclusively play female characters in RPGs, and I play half/half male/female when playing D&amp;D. 

In terms of family and friend groups, I am reluctant to come out until deep into transition. In terms of family, while they are supportive of me and we share a close bond, they tend to lessen the importance of some of my previous ""coming out"" moments. In particular, when describing a romantic interest I had in a boy even though I considered myself straight, they essentially described it as a phase that would pass. They meant well, as they were trying to console me due the fact that the relationship was never going to happen, but I don't think I could take that dismissiveness. It might be for that reason that I am reluctant to come out without showing ""proper dedication"" to the idea.

I have researched the transitioning process thoroughly, using mostly [https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/6fdw3s/tgau\_guides\_and\_statespecific\_info/](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/6fdw3s/tgau_guides_and_statespecific_info/) as a basis. 

In any case, I feel going over text is the best way to get this out there, considering I am a compulsive liar when it comes to therapists.

My life,"Hi, I‚Äôm not one to ever talk about how I feel online (Im really anti social about personal things) but I‚Äôm at the lowest point in my life that idk what to do... it all started when I was 10 years old, I knew I was always different always wanting to do feminine things instead of masculine things but I hid it from my entire family so well because I was always afraid of disappointing them. So over those years I did certain things like mess with my sisters things or my mothers in private and got caught a couple times but never really raised any suspicions oddly. When I entered high school that‚Äôs when everything hit me so hard, I was losing myself and I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore, my attitude was so nasty and I just distanced myself from everyone and everything which lead me to not focus on anything which I didn‚Äôt graduate my first senior year. At that point I wanted to die, just wanted to be me and I told my mom (who‚Äôs super religious and is a pastor along with her husband) and came out to her and she took it as a joke.. I told her everyone was feeling and even the secret boyfriend I hid and she didn‚Äôt say anything and walked to her room and stayed there in bed for weeks getting sick and crying each day, my mom has a really weak immune system so it‚Äôs really easy for her to get really sick, she said I was going to hell that the devil is controlling my mind etc. I git so angry that I blamed myself for getting my mother sick that I told her I was just confused because I didn‚Äôt want her to hurt herself. I sacrificed my happiness for hers. Now moving forward I‚Äôm at an even darker state of mind because ik if I say something it‚Äôll be a lot worse and it‚Äôll make my living situation hell. I‚Äôve fucked up my life in so many situations because I can‚Äôt get my mind of everything, I got no car, no friends in my town, no license at 20 years old. Everybody around me is doing fantastic then there‚Äôs me. Just wanting to be me and make my dream career a thing. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I honestly just want to end everything this pain is too much and I can‚Äôt take living and growing into the wrong person.

MTF Post Op Challenges (NSFW),"I am having difficulty framing this question due to my ignorance on the subject. The one time I managed to write it in a way I felt comfortable with it disappeared on me (technical difficulties). My apologies if I offend anyone here and if I were unintentionally say anything demeaning, assuming, etc. in this post; that is not my intention, and I would be immensely appreciative to be called out if I do so.

Half an hour to an hour ago I was scrolling across Twitter when I came across some j*ckasses trying to invalidate post-op trans women on the basis of the daily tasks required to maintain their bodies, which these fellows claimed were ""disgusting."" I wanted to retort somehow but because I'm so uneducated on the subject I didn't really know how to; I tried to look into what they were talking about but found myself unable to locate  information on it. Here was the only place I thought I might find that information. Unfortunately, as I'm having difficulty putting into words what they're referring to, I must quote them. I have attempted to censor any outright hateful garbage they said and focus on what is relevant, but as someone who is cis I'm not quite sure I'm in the position to be arbiter of what is inoffensive. Because of this I alert any of you who are uncomfortable viewing potential hate-speech to cease reading here. They said,

&gt; [Explicative]s literally have to shove a dildo in their . . . hole at least 4 hours a day for the rest of their lives in order to prevent their [vagina] from closing, since it's literally an open wound trying to heal. . . .

And,

&gt; During dilation [I do not know what this means] their hair from the inside gets torn off and clumps up in the back of their vagina. Every few weeks they have to dig out a giant hairball, or else they risk a greater chance of infection.

Are these struggles MTF women experience after sex reassignment surgery? I don't trust some assholes on the internet to be honest.

Odd question... Can I stop breast growth on mtf hormones?,"So... Weird question.. But here I am wondering if I can stay on hrt, but stop breast growth. I want everything else and am completely happy with everything... But I think if my breasts grow *more* it'll start reaching the dysphoric phase I'm worried about...    

So I really want to know if I can stop it, or slow it, without coming off hormones... Or if I have to just wait and see what my genes have in store and get reduction surgery later? I'm not sure...     

This isn't a humble brag,they are small. But I never wanted big breasts, C/D and beyond sound nice on paper, but if I actually think about it I don't think I'd feel comfortable.   

I knew I would eventually have to flirt with dysphoria going on hrt, but I didn't think it would be so soon, and I'm not sure what to do now.

How do you view trans-ness?,"I was at a conference talk last night with a bunch of trans people, and some of the panelists noted that the trans community needs to move away from a ""trapped in the wrong body"" mentality to describe trans-ness to cis people, and instead start emphasizing the social/gender aspects of trans-ness instead. I felt really isolated, since I am one of the trans people who feels like the ""trapped in the wrong body"" narrative fits me really well, and I don't really associate with the purely social/gender aspects of trans-ness, which I feel like are more geared towards non-binary individuals.

I think it is a very nuanced issue, and I am personally in favor of using both explanations to show cis people that not all trans people have the same reasons for being trans. However, I think some might complain that this divides the community, and that we should pick one narrative and stick to it, even if it doesn't strictly apply to everyone.

What does everyone here think?",asktransgender
How/Where to start transitioning? And a little catharsis (FTM),"I'm a 19 yr old student I really hate the fact that I haven't at least started socially transitioning when I got to college. It hasn't even been half a semester but it's bugging me so much because I'm constantly reminded by new friends that I'm not male (which isn't their fault-- they just sometimes ask me if I'm ok with being ""misgendered""). What's worse is that I feel as if my anxious feelings and dysphoria have gotten even worse every time I go outside: I'm afraid to walk, to talk, to stand up straight, to use my hands too much because to me, all of it will somehow broadcast to everyone that I'm female. 

Things are starting to get overwhelming when it comes to transitioning-- or lack thereof-- and I really want to start T and even get top surgery within 2 years because I'm so desperate and frustrated. I don't want to rush things, but I feel trapped into this idea and dread that I'll have to wait until I'm at least a graduate student (in about 3years time) to start anything because i think, ""I'll be *real* adult by then and I can make my own decisions and choose my therapist and doctor, etc."" 

I think the biggest thing holding me back is communicating these things to my family and those around me. I've come out to my family and close friends (none of them go to my university, though), and my parents are so supportive, especially my dad in the small ways like when he greets me with ""welcome home, sunny boy."" Thing is, it's extremely hard for me to be upfront about myself to anyone, idk why but it's always been that way. And when I do talk about it, it's always prompted by my parents, even though I always want to explain how I feel and my plans to transition.

I've only gone to my regular doctor once since I came out to my family, and I told my doctor I was transgender. It felt awkward for me and my doctor, who said she'd look into it and contact us about transgender youth groups, which was nice, but then she never followed up on it. It really put me off, and I don't know how to bring up that fact and that I want to have a therapist (who can help me with dysphoria and other non-trans problems) and a more concrete plan for taking testosterone, top surgery, and legally changing my name.

There's a lot to this, and hopefully I'm not the only one who wants to explode from the sheer amount of ache from wanting to transition but can't/haven't/don't know how to (actually I hope no one else feels like this, because it's shit). And because of all these things I need to do, *I don't even know where to start.* How do i even bring up being trans to my friends? Will they be ok with it? Or do I just try to get a therapist first, and once I start T, explain how I feel? These worries are eating at me.",asktransgender

I've recently became a member of a gym. I am a transwoman, am on hormones for a while now but presenting as female clothing wise etc is not an option yet.

3 years since coming out with no progress-my femininity that comes naturally feels overdramatic and whorish/slutty in its subconscious need for attention; i feel like ill never transition properly and im better off being a sissy,"trigger warning and NSFW: feminine ideals, sissification, sexist norm thoughts, autogynephilia, surgery, sexual stuff, BDSM

i want to transition but

transition ~~feels me~~ fills me--wow now i cant type--with shame.  no, rather, im filled with shame because of how i lose my desire for complete and utter feminization after penile orgasm.   i still have a bit of--oh i wouldnt mind being mistaken for a girl feelings, maybe ill wear my hair in an androgynously feminine way, but the reality of my maleness is too strong to go against.   worse, i very much link my genitals to my gender/sex.  i dont think ill ever feel like a woman without SRS.  i want SRS, but there are times i wake up with the morning wood and i think, well, i could get used to this, i imagine (being virgin) it would be really pleasurable to have sex with it, or to get a blowjob (which practically feels sexist to say, but red pillers would call me a cuck for being weirded out/afraid to talk about male pleasure at the hands of women, but well, idfk).

i cant get realistic about transition and its been 3 years with no progress.  i dont feel right in womens clothes when i dont pass. i just dont.   i dont feel right in womens clothes with a male voice, with my face structure, with my penis.

i was always into the forced feminization stuff when i was closeted.  then i came out, went on hormones during a depressive episode of my life, hormones and that depression (and anxiety and paranoia all aside from hormones) didnt mix well.  doctors gatekept me from hormones after i mentioned my depression/anxiety/paranoia, and sometimes i feel it was for the best that i was taken off hormones.  off of hormones, the forced feminization stuff takes up my sexual free time again.  but while i was on hormones i was very confused and scared (it doesnt help that i didnt reach out and get help in social transition at all, i was very alone).  i was very confused and scared mainly because losing the male libido made me lose a lot of desire to transition, and seeing how linked my transition was to my sexual feelings in that very direct way, after learning about autogynephilia and the world seeing me as a pervert well...that is a very strong feeling (i struggle to even talk about this stuff because i feel like a fraud for not being trans enough and being conflicted with how hormones affected my libido and genitals, yet also like a true trans for how i feel about my penis) however, i hate smelling like a man again, hate that my facial hair is coming in (endocrinologist didnt think i would masculinize anymore, clearly she didnt realized my beard wasnt finished developing, yay XP) but sometimes i wonder if i cant get used to that too, beard hair and whatnot.  i still dont really like being a man but i sorta feel i can live with it.  it makes me more interesting to be a feminine man. it makes me more likeable to be a feminine man.  it makes me more attractive to be a feminine man, especially when my body feels not feminine enough to be a proper woman.  in other words, my body feels too testosteronized and i worry the only way id have ever been comfortable transitioning is if i had started before puberty.

puberty feels like pandora's box.  now that i experienced male puberty, i cling to it despite so much of maleness being something i hate about myself.   maybe that makes me genderfluid or something.  course even women get the urge to penetrate, from what ive read on forums.  not so different from everybody wondering what its like on the other side of the binary i guess.

edit to add the part about feeling whorish and slutty for attention.  i remember noticing myself acting like a tease in front of my male roomates when i was high (drugs r bad, caused my paranoia to spiral out of control), bending down to grab something with my butt showing in tight pants and going red in the face when i realized it, and when i realized what i was doing i was fucking horrified (whore-ified) and disgusted.

so why dont i try being a sissy in real life right? well i have no life.  i dropped out of college after the depression/anxiety/paranoia and the HRT, and i have failed to get a job for three years while also failing to socially transition for three years.  maybe if i find this idyllic unicorn household where i can be their third, their plaything in a kinky way, maybe that forced feminization will take away some of the guilt and responsibility, and the shame of looking at women and feeling like im looking at her like a man when women can simply admire women for their beauty without being a threat to men--always felt like i got in the way of couples that i knew when i looked at (another) girl, their girlfriend, with admiration and envy...and lust?  but maybe with forced feminization and freedom from guilt and responsibility eventually ill come into my own and be able to take transition by the reins myself? well im afraid to even reach out for one thing.  my therapist basically diagnosed me with avoidant personality disorder after taking some tests and it feels accurate.   and with that sortof stuff, even using a site like fetlife, how can i trust someone doesnt have STDs. or that theyll treat me right. or etc etc etc.   and further, how do i know that it wont make things worse--

\--how do i know that i wont rope (BDSM pun lightly intended) femininity and submission tighter together until i truly cant be feminine without utter submissiveness and well, i dont want that...right? but that seems to be how i am and i just dont know if i can change while being true to myself--that is to say, idk if i can be a proper feminist in the streets and a rope bunny in the sheets, when whenever i try to be feminine it comes out all perverted and sissified and wrong and its just too embarassing to ever try to be public--unless im literally being a forced femme sissy in public at the behest of a domme or whatever (clearly i want to tell the world about my fantasies, oh well).  how can i ever be a dominant woman when all my dominant attitudes and actions feel utterly fuckign masculine and male to me, in an almost triggering way.  it doesnt feel right trying to be a woman when so much of it (for me) is based around my penis.

*i dont want to be a male, to be a husband in the future, but for the male self that the world knows me as, it somehow feels right.  does that make sense?*

i cant separate my female self or become my female self from the male self that i was and have been and basically reluctantly am, and it feels unchangeable.  my entire family and extended family and friends have been (verbally) supportive and some of the women have even tried to get me to do feminine activities but when it feels so driven by my goddamn penis, its like, how can i not feel like a fucking pervert.  and the fact that HRT made things more confusing not less (altho i was very depressed/panic attacks/paranoid issues at the time) only makes me less sure that im really trans.

i hate this.  i know its something to talk with a therapist about but i struggle to do that and my regular therapist doesnt get it, and my gender therapist is booked for months.  


edit 2: i shoulda just stayed closeted and saved myself the trouble of not being sure and certainly not being ready for real life transition.  i almost want to tell everyone i was wrong about transition but for one i dont want to hurt the trans movement by encouraging the ""i regret it"" stereotype and for two then whatll happen, two years later ill say ""hey everyone actually transition was right hah..hahah..nervous laugh""  and then people will think less of transition and less of me, since clearly i cant make up my mind on anything and transition must be a simple whim decision and nothing to take seriously.  obviously not the case but ugh, kms",asktransgender

A question for MTF about pre-transition from a concerned but supportive wife.,"Husband and I have been together for 10 years.  He turns 40 this year &amp; I‚Äôm 31. I am not shy and make no apologies for my sexuality, I‚Äôve been pansexual since I was 12 and I do not hide it. My husband is the polar opposite, he carries a lot of shame for the things he likes, partially because of the fear of our incredibly religious community, but also because his family are bigots. They surpass just being bigots but they‚Äôre also narcissists, my husband has spent his whole life trying to make them happy, often putting me and his kids on the back burner for them.

He came out a year into our marriage, I was surprised but ultimately accommodating, but the masculinity was deeply engrained and caused him to be very back and forth with what he wanted and how he wanted me to see him. Ultimately the idea of his family disowning him shut him down to the idea.

Fast forward with no mention of him wanting to transition for 8 years, when mentioned he would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over that idea‚Äù and put his walls up.

This summer he expressed an interest in one of my biggest kinks that we never explored together, Cuckqueaning (opposite of cuckold, where the man is with multiple women). Things went well aside from usual stresses of him being new to it and me walking him through. His last experience got messy and confusing as he started having problems achieving erections. I instantly worried about his health, heart, etc. he said it was probably stress from work, or from my kink (that I recommended we put on hold several times) because he had to play a dominant role when he is usually submissive.

He told me that for months he‚Äôs been looking at feminization again, and wonders if since the basis of feminization &amp; cuckqueaning are opposite, if it could be a factor. He wanted to cross dress, he wanted to become a sissy. Again, I am a sexual scientist, and having always found him to be slightly submissive, easy peasy! I also thought this would help with his erection issue, He hadn‚Äôt been able to achieve an erection in weeks, &amp; somehow managed to orgasm completely soft once.

The minute he put on the panties and clothing I had went out and bought him, he was good to go. Not only was he able to achieve an erection, he had multiple orgasms! That was a week ago, switching from one kink to another is exhausting so one night I opted for just a quickie and the ED came back. I didn‚Äôt say anything but I began to wonder and he had created multiple social media accounts for his new Sissy persona, who he rightfully named. While scanning through his tumblr hoping for ideas, as this is new to me and he doesn‚Äôt share much of his wants or desires aside from dressing and telling me he wants to be with men. I noticed his posts aren‚Äôt sexual, they‚Äôre more like inspiration boards, women he wants to looks like, he frequently asks if I think he‚Äôs too old to transition, what would happen, how would I feel. 

Now we‚Äôre back at transitioning again, what he wants changes from day to day. But during our talk lastnight I just came out and said ‚ÄúI think not going forward with transitioning is effecting your libido‚Äù  and for a moment he was defensive (deeply embedded masculinity) but then he started to consider the idea before thinking about his family and giving me a flat out ‚ÄúNO I could never do that‚Äù

For now he wants to stick with this Femdom dynamic (sporadically) which I‚Äôve embraced but struggle with him fighting his internal demons, hot and cold. And I just really want him to be who he feels like he should be. But he refuses to believe it could be an issue at all. To me it‚Äôs sort of simple, no erection with any girls (not even able to masturbate)  VS multiple orgasms while imaging a full transition.  Is this body dysmorphia? Could the erectile dysfunction be from forcing himself into his family and societies box built for him?

TL;DR: my husband has wanted to transition for almost 20 years and hasn‚Äôt. Could his current erectile dysfunction be caused by this regret? Did any MTF here have problems with erections prior to transitioning? 

Hoping for advice on how to help him.

Fate forced me tell my dad!,"Apologies this might be long and drawn out...

So, I‚Äôve been coming out to my friends. And it‚Äôs all been a ‚Äòfate‚Äô kind of thing to tell them. Things feel like they are moving fast.
When I see them I hear fate telling me to tell them. And it‚Äôs been a really positive experience, it could‚Äônt be more amazing!

... I‚Äôve been holding off telling my dad. Even considered not telling him. He‚Äôs approaching 80 and lives in a mediteranean country. Where trans anything is taboo. However, the ocean view is stunning!

I had planned on telling my brother and sister first, and I promise I was building up to telling him ...Maybe? I guess I took to long to tell a sibling, because today FATE rang my phone and on the other end was my father, his voice cheerful, asking how I am. Oh my god. How can i not tell him now? A lump in my throat. Fear in my heart,  Tears welling up in my eyes of the shame and rejection to come... I had a moment of silence, I just couldn‚Äôt say anything. Finally I managed to tell him I had to tell him something deeply personal which may affect our relationship as father and son, and that  I would understand if it‚Äôs something he cant deal with or rejects and doesn‚Äôt want to see me again.
(I‚Äôve been building up for rejection in my head for the last few weeks, so it‚Äôs easier to say it than I thought it would be even if it took what seemed like forever to get it out through silent tears.

His initial response took me by surprise and the questions kept coming: ‚Äúwho made you wear women‚Äôs clothes when you were 13?‚Äù Does that mean you want wear g-strings?, Does that mean you want to wear stilettos?‚Äù Does that mean you‚Äôre gay? Have you slept with men? Does your wife know? Your 50 you have a mans body, mans legs. You‚Äôve got a big nose, wear pants if you come here. Your wife is going to leave, does that mean you want to sleep with men?  You should see a psychologist, see two, get them to ‚Äúfix‚Äù you. This is because of your mother and your grandmother. It‚Äôs all in your head, you read to many books and they‚Äôve affected you.

It was one question after another.

I was left reeling. I know he was to. He said he didn‚Äôt see this coming. Understandable. I was good at keeping this a secret. Considering i only see him every other year. But he did say he loves me, though there‚Äôs nothing he can do for me. I told him I‚Äôm considering HRT. His words of warning were are you sure you want to change your body? Your wife will leave you, does that mean you want to be with a man? /really?

I‚Äôm not thinking about this being so I can ‚Äòsleep with a man or a woman. I would prefer to stay with my wife! We‚Äôre a powerful team.

But he did say he loves me and that I am capable of making my own decisions. Even though I didn‚Äôt hear from him the perfect script: ‚Äú I love you whatever you want to be and will support you regardless of any difficulties ahead‚Äù I think I got what he was willing or capable of giving me at this time. I can imagine how difficult it is to imagine your  son as a woman, because all you see is a mans face in a dress and heels and the image is so incongruous it could just be a Monty python grotesquerie on display. And if that‚Äôs the image in his head I totally get it. And. I want tell him HRT makes your features more feminine. Of course the nose and chin need some work what can I do about that dad?
But I didn‚Äôt want to tell him that. This is a lot for him to process, and I just gave him one helluva download. Sorry dad.

This shit is hard!
I don‚Äôt feel completely rejected - which is a better scenario than I expected. And he still asked me when i would be coming to visit next? I love my dad. And now I‚Äôm double guessing myself. Not as much as I would have a few months ago. And I‚Äôm not feeling overwhelmed with shame of who I am. Sure the road ahead is uncertain, but isn‚Äôt that what an adventure is? Uncertain of success or failure - hoping for success the most.

As long as I am content with who I am - that‚Äôs important.

So it's been a weird week. Am I.. You know?,"Hi. 

&amp;nbsp;

My name is not John. Obviously. Made the account as a throwaway and got too lazy to actually throw it and make a new one.  
&amp;nbsp;

I'm not proud to say that my acceptance of trans folks was nothing but an ignorant man thinking with his dick. They were ""exotic"", so to speak, and I didn't know anything about them below the surface. That is until I started following them on twitter for free newds. Ended up seeing their shitposting, their interactions with each other, that weird moment when they tweet about what's troubling them, or when they tweet advice for other trans about hrt and crap. My ignorance was remedied, bit by bit. Except for the biggest one. Believe it or not, I've only learned about ""gender dysphoria"" about a month or so ago, and learned about what it meant/feel like last week.  
&amp;nbsp;

One of the people I followed talked about her experience with gender dysphoria, her body, her attitude back then. And I ended up drawing a lot of parallels with her experience. I got worried, started questioning myself, because I have shit self-esteem. I started to examine more of my past. There was a lot of stuff that I went through but blamed it on something else because I had no idea that this was a thing. Like a guy who never knew what a cold is despite having it his whole life.  
&amp;nbsp;

Things like&amp;nbsp;

- Body hatred. Blamed it on fat. Even back when I was skinny and handsome that married women paid me 30 bucks just to strip (and do that other thing) on camera, I still felt ugly and detested my body.
- Innate feeling of ""This isn't my body."" I blamed that on my weeby chuunibyou-ness. Combined with the first one, I just gave up and stopped taking care of my body. Gained weight, bad skin condition, bad scalp condition, everything went to shit because it's not even my body and I couldn't care about it. Just couldn't.
- I was never happy ever since I hit puberty. Blamed that on shitty dysfunctional family. And yet when I went to college, far away from home, never called never write, spent my time ""having fun"", never thinking about family or home or anything remotely close, I was still not happy.
- Started doing ""gay shit"" like painting my room pink, walking with a gait when I'm alone, putting stuff in me (you know what I'm talking about), developing a taste and craving for feminine fashion, staring at a bridal shop across the street during lunch just wondering how I'd look in those wedding dress. Changing my online moniker to girly engrish-sounding version of my real name. Blamed that on me being ""rebellious"" and trying to break the mold for gender roles. I'm disobedient, but I don't rebel. Too much of a coward and a sloth to do any rebelling.
- Dressing in my mom's clothes when I was a in my teen years. Not for kink or anything. I just wore them and took naps. They were comfortable and relaxing.
- The only selfie that I can accept is the most girly-looking one. Rationalized it as ""well everything else was ugly."".  
&amp;nbsp;

There's a lot more that I fished out from the depth of my memory but as of this moment, those are the ones at the top of my head. Anyway, on their own, they just seemed like random crap I do. People who knew me knows I do random shit and paid no mind to isolated incidents. But ever since last week, it's like I found a keyword to this cipher and those gibberish started making sense.  
&amp;nbsp;

I went to my online friends whom I know pretty accepting about things like this. Talked it over with them. One of them is gay and pretty observant, told me that he noticed when I was talking about trans, it seemed more like I wanted to be them rather than be with them. They were supportive, and it felt good coming to them about this. But I was still scared, I was afraid that all this is just my fucking brain playing tricks on me. Part of me suspect it's pulling a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" move, because this thing is fucking evil. 5 minutes alone with it and you'll see how evil it gets. ahem. Sorry. Anyways.  
&amp;nbsp;

Last night, I tried something. When everybody's asleep, I'm in my room alone, I said to myself just loud enough for me to hear it. ""I'm a girl."" I felt a rush I never felt before. I ended up repeating it over and over, I felt... Happy? I was smiling, on the verge of tears, I felt so good about myself for the first time in years. For once, I didn't hate the face that was in the mirror. I ended up repeating that phrase over and over until I fall asleep and it was the best fucking sleep I've had, except when I slept after having some edibles but those were chemically-induced so they don't count.  
&amp;nbsp;

My friends took that reaction to affirmation as deciding point and offered to call me by feminine pronoun and once again I was on the verge of tears. I declined, still afraid. Still not sure despite how good and liberating it felt from that simple phrase.  
&amp;nbsp;

This brings me to why I'm posting here. What was it like for you? How did you know who you are? How were you so sure? What's it like after you cross over that line and started your transition? I'm in a place where such decision cannot be taken lightly, and once I come out, shit will be stirred. If this is just my brain fucking with me, I'll have to deal with the aftermath and not even happy about why I have to. That and it's pretty much impossible to get diagnosis for GID here since the bigotry runs deep and my last experience with psychologists were less than ideal (bitch sold me out to psychiatric ward to sell more pills &gt;:c)",asktransgender
Going on a work trip to Germany. 1-2 days to do whatever I want. Anyone know any German Transgender communities?,"I'm a pre-everything MTF  going to Germany tonight for a week  of work. Deeply closeted in my home country (Singapore).I have 1-2 days of freedom to dress however I want.

Problem is, I have short hair and don't know anything about makeup. I'm wondering if I could reach out to the transgender community for help. Or even just to hang out.

If you know of anything (forums, discord servers) please let me know, it will be much appreciated!

Are some people just doomed to never pass?,"I'm 21 years old, been on HRT for a year and a half and I've been full time for 5 months. I have never male-failed, I don't pass and I doubt I ever will. 

Even when I'm presenting as femininely as I can in public and I keep my mouth shut I'm still called sir. Is there something wrong with me? Am I just so ruined by testosterone that I'm never going to get to look normal?

This all feels so pointless. I don't feel like a woman and I don't feel comfortable at all. I don't use women's toilets anymore, I don't give a female name for stuff. Part of me thinks I should just go back to presenting male and pretend I never even came out.",asktransgender

Restoring fertility to have a baby,"Hi,

My partner and I, who is also trans (FTM), are wanting to have a baby. I've been transitioning medically for about six months. My AA is androcur and while I started with patches I didn't get adequate oestrogen levels until I changed to tablets two months ago.

I should have banked sperm, but never saw children as being a possibility... until I met the love of my life.

Does anyone know how long it will take for my sperm production and a decent count to return? Or is it already too late?

Best wishes to everyone,

How do I ease her voice dysphoria?,"She absolutely hates her voice. Which I do understand, I really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight we sent each other a couple voice messages, and on the last one she sent me I made a comment on the background music. She was saying something mushy and there was a movie on tv that she was watching and the music just sort of timed up perfectly with what she was saying (it was some sort of romantic/suspenseful sounding music (if that makes any sort of sense), I thought it was kinda a cute coincidence). And she didn't know what I was talking about, so she went to listen to it. Listening to her voice in that clip just seemed to crush her. It really bothers me that she can get put down so quickly about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I do understand. There are things about myself that sometimes they can completely crush my spirit, even on an otherwise great day. And I know that it's a case by case basis on voice for trans lads and ladies alike. I just need some sort of insight, I guess. What I really want to do is just sit here and tell her just how much I absolutely adore listening to her voice. I love the sound of it, I love the way she pronounces words, I love her tone and volume and it's the most amazing and comforting sound to me. However I know that it's a very bad idea to focus in on it and bring even more attention to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't ever want her to feel discouraged from talking. And I wanted to know if you guys have any suggestions/ideas/\*halp\* for just helping to ease that in some way or another. She's my first girlfriend, and the first trans person I've personally known, so I'm still in pretty new waters here. I know that I can't fix it, but if I could just help to ease it, I think that would help a lot. ",asktransgender

Can't accept myself I guess?,"This is my first time really posting on here, but this seems like a good sub and I thought I would sort of get some stuff off my chest and seek advice.

So I'm the type of person whose always been sort of insecure about herself. Throughout my transition (1 year HRT plus laser hair removal) I always looked for the smallest changes, the smallest things that don't look right about me, and so on. I have always been super self conscious about how I look throughout my transition and look in the mirror every day scrutinizing myself over every thing about my appearance and going out every day (full time now) feeling like I am being started at by every other student at my university when it's probably not the case in addition to being incredibly anxious to the point where I am sometimes shaking. I've turned down invitations to things just out of fear of letting other people see me. 

And the thing is I have changed \*a ton\* in terms of appearance in addition to my voice passing pretty well. I've had people who use to tell me I don't pass start to say I am really cute. I get compliments on my hair all the time by other people. Every month I am getting gendered correctly more and more. Objectively, I am headed in the right direction and doing a lot better, but for some odd reason \*I don't\* feel that way. Everyones been nothing but super nice to me. I wake up every morning criticizing myself to death. Every-time I meet other trans people, I wish I was them and not \*myself\*. Sometimes I miss the days of pre-transition and feeling that like at least fit in with everyone else, despite having way more dysphoria then. 

Honestly I don't know what to do about it. Some people have told me that it just takes time to really build self confidence and self esteem. I just didn't know if anyone else in the course of their transition has felt this and has advice for ""coping"" with it I guess...",asktransgender
Is it wrong to want to exclusively date trans girls?,"So, I haven't ever been in a serious relationship before in my entire life. I'm an adult child of an alcoholic, and have issues with PTSD and anxiety so it really hasn't ever been on my radar.

I'm in my mid 20s, and from the outside you'd never think I have problems meeting or even speaking to women. But every time I try I just feel apathetic about it. I just assumed I'd be forever asexual.

I've used tinder for about a year, get tons of matches from girls to the point where I could probably hook up with anyone I want if I had the confidence. But I don't, and I can't fake it. Have never even messaged anyone or asked for a date or even flirted. Online or in person.

But recently I met this trans girl, and we hit it off so well. We went on a date a couple days later and wanted to do it again. I made some pretty nice plans, but she flaked. We made more plans, she flaked again.

Then some crazy ass random drama happened out of nowhere like god snacking me in the face. From then on she couldn't trust me, now the relationship is over and I'm so torn. Meeting her was the best I've ever felt, and I thought we'd be perfect to at least try to get to know each other. But it didn't happen.

I was probably too forward with my intent on creating a long term relationship without actually getting to know her completely first. That mistake will haunt me.

Oh yeah also she was a dom, and I'm sub.  So that turned me on like no other. Plus the fact we are both ridiculously attractive, which I let her know.

I've never even looked at trans porn, this hasn't even been on my radar until recently. I was into vanilla stuff, I stopped watching porn altogether anyway.

Anyway, I can't really ever see myself with a cis woman. Maybe it has something to do with the abuse I received as a child, and the fact I feel it makes me a note empathetic person. Which makes me feel I can relate to a trans girl more.

**TL;DR: Is wanting to date only trans girls a possibility without being a chaser? Just be genuinely attracted to them? Or am I living in a fantasy?**

[Rant] Made up stories about trans people is just dumb.,"I saw a post on r/&lt;redacted&gt; (I'm sure you know which sub) that claimed the person had ""escaped the cult of trans"" and listed all these blatantly wrong things about trans culture.

1. I have never heard of ""berry flavored"" estradiol, and I'm pretty sure it isnt real. A quick Google search didnt come up with anything
2. No one shunned you for de-transitioning. It happens. Sometimes for medical necessity, some for social necessity, or something for other reasons. Detransition is valid, too.
3. No mature trans person will tell you that you are trans and HAVE to transition JUST BECAUSE you like artsy movies and wine. Trans people dont identify as their gender because they feel they fit into certain norms, it's more than that. By claiming that's what you were told by trans people, you're blatantly admitting you're a spiteful cis person with a defamation agenda.
4. No, you did not just create an alt because you dont want your rant linked to your main reddit account. You did it because the whole post it a lie, used to stir hate in an already hateful community. Stop creating fictitious arguments so you can feel righteous in your own unjustified anger.
