<p>A surge can happen once per turn. If a surge effect is a spell, it's too wild to be affected by Metamagic. If it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tides_of_Chaos">Tides of Chaos</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
</p><p>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bend_Luck">Bend Luck</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Controlled_Chaos">Controlled Chaos</span></h3>
<p>At 14th level, whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Bombardment">Spell Bombardment</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, when you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.
