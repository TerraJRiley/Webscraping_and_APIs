I disagree with the one hero limit makes balance worse, I think it helps if anything (remember 2 or 3 mcrees per team?) but yea I agree with everything else, Soldier is just kind of outclassed by mcree I think low level play still benefits from solider where they just can't aim to save their life so he's more forgiving over mcree even if his realistic potential dps and effectiveness is far lower.","

Yea I was a high plat/low diamond league player and I was always getting frustrated when something became a bit OP, but after playing Overwatch it's really put into perspective how much worse balance can be handled. Not to mention league has over 100 heroes, hundreds of items, a ton of different gameplay mechanics like towers, jungle, dragon baron, minions, movement speed. I'm not sure why Overwatch isn't near perfectly balanced there really isn't a whole lot to actually balance. and they had 10 months closed beta.","

When did Riot charge $70 for a game, with the promise all cosmetics will be unlock able with in game currency (for the games entire life span one could assume), and then with the first batch of new cosmetic content completely go back on that promise? Also Riot games all things considered have done quite a good job of punishing pro players, which is insane when you think about it because leagues pro players are a FAR BIGGER asset then some random pro aimbotter who plays in tourneys that get 40k viewers at best.","

"Brah you don't know half of Riot game's history. They've done some SHADY crap to try and push out competition like DotA in their life time. A few notable examples off the top of my head are:Phreak originally ran a forum and community for DotA. When he signed onto LoL the website became a beacon of adverts for the game while the archive of forum posts disappeared. When the archive of the forums resurfaced a few years later, LoL was already a big name.So a big employee killed a hangout for the community of an old game that his company based their game off of. Who cares right? I'm sure the creators of Rammus and Teemo care since there were some odd looking holes in the archives of the hero suggestions sub forum. That's right, Rammus and Teemo were originally fan hero ideas for DotA 1 back in the day but their creators never got any credit and can't prove it any more.Oh and there's also that time where LoL tried to force esport teams to exclusively only field LoL teams and cut ties with their biggest competitors like DotA.I honestly don't care that much about this whole thing at the moment because I don't like the Olympic content too much besides the Symmetra emote and because I only play this game on rare occasions lately. But what they've done isn't enough for me to flip tables over LoL's ""free to play"" model of spending as good as a few years of your life to get all of the champions and maybe a few more for all of the runes and rune pages to be competitive in a solo queue. I say this as someone who has a ranked icon for every season but S3.","

I remember how broken Frost Mage was and how almost every 2's Arena team was Unholy DK/Holy Paladin. Blizzard didn't get around to fixing DKs until the expansion was almost over, and Frost Mage was retarded for even longer than that.Riot had their fair share of !@#$ups...like release Xin Zhao and Kassadin in general. LoL's balance is about as good as Overwatch's balance: one overpowered character can easily warp the entire metagame around them. But since LoL has so many different working parts, there's no question who has the better balance team.","

I have said it on Warcraft forums but as long as gamers go buy games based on ''hype'' this will happen.Blizzard as a company ofc cares for the money.It was always like that but in the past at least they cared about their customers.Now what they do only care is their broken ''vision'' to make their games more ''New Player'' friendly and bring even more players in to their games that as we saw from Warcraft is not the caseBut the good think is that there are companies out there that can take your respect with what they release.For example my all time favorite game is Disohored.A game that has 3 DLC that are 3 complete defferent stories from the main game and its worth every Euro you Spend.,"

"What you listed are ways that people can get instantly killed. This is something that the Overwatch team looks for and trys to limit, like how they are changing Hanzo's scatter ability.

Moira orbs bounce off of walls, because they are met with force, soundwaves are pure force. How can Genji's sword deflect the orbs? They're met with accurate force. It's physics, it makes perfect sense.Why doesn't it bounce off of literally any ability or character then?Characters are biotic so it interacts differently with them. ""literally any object"" doesn't have enough force.In my mind anyway.","

"I have no answer to ""Are Omnics partly biotic?"" though. Is it said in the lore at all that Omnics have 0 biotic make up?Edit: I feel like part of them must be if biotic field effects them.","

And Bastion's not organic so why doesn't it bounce off of him?","

Basically all healing in the game is nano machines, or Lucio having good music.","

"This would be amazing counterplay. And maybe mei should be able to freeze them, I mean they are like a nanite liquid globule.02/17/2018 09:37 PMPosted by Terranguard02/17/2018 09:22 PMPosted by CrazyMageI have no answer to ""Are Omnics partly biotic?"" though.

How about Mccree and Soldier 76 can lock on and destroy tire with their ults? It could be a pretty reasonable counter to the rip tire and how strong it is in pro play. Overwatch is a game about countering after all.,"

"Yeah lol it's hilarious,""I've got you in my sights!""Stares at Rip-Tire,""I can't control my ***king arms to aim at that stupid tire which is about to kill me!!!""","

"Depends if McCree gets phantom bullets like in Junkenstein, cos it would suck to miss a 6 man because of a tire.","

"How about NO, counterplay.  Whine less, play better.  WHAAAAAA, My Aimbot doesn't insta-kill EVERYTHING. Mommy, its not fair...If your still standing around holding your pistol all glowing, by the time he fires tire, and hunts you with it...  YOU DESERVE TO DIE.","

"Next, Soldier ult aims at trees, birds, etc.","

I think it is safe to say, during High noon he has infinite ammo and it just doesn't show it.","

And lets not forget that Soldier and Mccree can actually lock on to each other and they have to be in a middle of a fight, meanwhile junk is off in china in a little dark room sitting on a health pack.","
