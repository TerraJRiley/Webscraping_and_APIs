<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting"> Spellcasting </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cantrips">Cantrips</span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Cleric_Spells" title="Cleric Spells">cleric spell list</a>. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparing_and_Casting.C2.A0Spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></h3>
<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
</p><p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when Setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p><p><b>Spell Attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ritual_Casting">Ritual Casting</span></h3>
<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Focus">Spellcasting Focus</span></h3>
<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Domain"> Divine Domain </span></h2>
<p>Choose one domain related to your deity. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Domain.C2.A0Spells">Domain Spells</span></h3>
<p>Each domain has a list of spells that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity"> Channel Divinity </span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level, you start with two abilities: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.
</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.
</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Turn.C2.A0Undead">Turn Undead</span></h3>
<p>As an action, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ability_Score_Improvement"> Ability Score Improvement </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Scores" title="Ability Scores">ability score</a> of your choice by +2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by +1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Destroy_Undead"> Destroy Undead </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed. The CR of undead increases as you gain levels.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Intervention"> Divine Intervention </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf as an action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention.
</p><p>If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
</p><p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Warding_Flare">Warding Flare</span></h3>
<p>At 1st level, when you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.
</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity:_Invoke_Duplicity">Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level,as an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
</p><p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity:_Cloak_of_Shadows">Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

<p>At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum range of 120 feet.

Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity:_Invoke_Duplicity_2">Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
</p><p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
