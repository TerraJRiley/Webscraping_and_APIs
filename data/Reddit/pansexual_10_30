Am i bi or pan?,"[18 M] For about 3 years I've identified as Bi. Everyone i ever had a crush on was cis so it just seemed the most accurate term.

I came out at work and I'm scared.,"I'm mostly worried because I work at a rehab facility for teens.  One of the girls was talking about her sexuality with another gay staff member and the kid asked me if I was straight and then immediately told another staff member I wasn't when she asked what we were talking about. These kids will lie about anything so I really hope this doesn't bite me in the butt down the road and I'm gonna stay in view of cameras always. 

Sorry for the weird vent I could use some support my state isn't very accepting and I've seen my trans gf get turned down jobs before while they hire literally anyone to do the work so that's what scares me despite the fact we have other gay and bi staff. ",pansexual
I'm pansexual?,I recently discovered that I was pansexual as me and my friend were talking and I was already out as Bi but he asked me if I would go out with anyone of any gender if it was based on personality and I said yeah. Does this mean I'm a pansexual?,pansexual

Private and content,"For as long as I can remember, I've never been sexually/romantically attracted to any one sex or gender. I have always found myself, in the correct circumstances, being (sexually and/or romantically) attracted to a full spectrum of individuals. I am sharing this after reading all kinds of empowering and inspiring stories about people coming out and the relief they feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been a very private person when it comes to my feelings, sexually and romantically. I often hide them out of fear of being hurt. I've been physically and emotionally abused, and it's hard for me to move past, so I often only divulge my sexuality to very close friends/close romantic partners. I was a very headstrong child and once tried to come out to my parents, however, they wrote it off as teenage rebellion. Since that time, I've hidden my sexuality/romantic interests from my family (just as I've hidden my physical and emotional abuse). I've always considered myself the black sheep of the family, and the lone wolf of my own friend group.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an extraordinarily hard time opening up to anyone regarding this matter (in addition to several others), however, I prefer to remain secretive about it, because I feel that this kind of mystery gives me some kind of power over my life that I would lose without it. I still represent for the pansexual community and I outspokenly fight for our community and attend political rallies in an overtly Republican state. But I prefer not to discuss my own romantic/sexual interests even within my ally/friend group, and I'm happy with this.",pansexual

"Wish me luck? Today I come out to my two closest friends (married couple, one straight, one bi).","They know me as straight or mostly straight, but i was not open with myself about this till this year. So, when I finally was honest with myself I just never told them yet. I wanted to wait till I had an experience with a guy first, to know it was not just thoughts, but actions felt right too.. maybe? I dunno. Anyway, this week I had my first M2M experience and while not great, it made it clear to me that yup, I am a pancake. Parts don't matter, just the person, connection, or moment. So, now that a ""test run"" has been completed and nothing changed, It is time to tell them. I feel like I have been lying to them. It is eating me up inside. They are my world. So, today is the day I get to see them, I am leaving soon and will drive the 2 1/2 hours to where they live. 

When I first get there i will be setting up my PS4 to borrow their insanely fast internet (compared to my DSL), to download RDR2 pre-load. Then before we go out to dinner/cabaret show we have plans for, I am going to have a talk with them. They both know I need to talk to them, but I don't think they know what of. Well... one of them might due to a text message error a month ago when an online gay friend was asking what apps i downloaded and when i responded it was in the wrong window. 0_o I covered it up tying it in to something else that seemed believable, but who knows. 

Even though I know they love me, that they will always accept me for who I am, and that even one of them is bi... I feel scared. I feel nervous. 

I can't really be open about it where i live and the people around me day to day, but they are the only ones IRL I can come out too. So I know as soon as i can get this over with i will feel a tad.. freer? 

It is going to be a long day even though it should not be a bad one.

I keep mulling over like different speeches in my mind on how to tell them, but so far nothing sticks.

I bought this cute little pan gamer pin a bit back, and while i can't put it on the front of my vest i normally wear, i hooked it to the underside. So I can flip that side of the vest over a little and show them the pin to start the convo maybe... i dunno. 

Thoughts? Ideas? Things to say? Questions i should be prepared for? Anyone got any advice? 

Someone wish me well?

I can't really talk about this with anybody really. People were supportive of me being bi, but outside of LGBT+ and ally circles there's a lot of ignorance about non-binary genders around people I know.

Anyway, that was a lot of words to basically say this: I identify as bi, but am using this post to officially also come out as pan. A forward slash sexuality, if you will (bi / pan).
Is this ok? Or am I just being weird? It wouldn't surprise me if it was the latter.",pansexual

They all see me and treat me as a GUY...which I'm not...I'm not blaming them or anything. But not being treated like the woman I am triggers my dysphoria and also makes me feel so lonely.

A few weeks ago I was asked if I was bi. I responded that I didn‚Äôt identify as being bisexual, but that I am attracted to some women. That I see sexuality as being fluid. That I love being with men, but I‚Äôve also been with women and also love it. 

Then I really started to think about myself, my sexuality, preferences...

I called my best friend. When I told her about the guy asking if I was bi and me being confused how to respond, she said with much ease, as if it was so obvious, that I was pansexual. I never really knew what the term meant, so I obviously turned to google. She described it as being a lover of all beings, and not being attracted to any particular gender and seeing gender as binary. 

After trying to do some research, I think I can confidently say I identify as being pansexual.

So I found out my Nana supports me.,"So a little context about my family; My mother whilst she is pretty chill about the whole LGBTQ thing only thinks there are three sexualities and has debated with me about it a few times.

My siblings just shrug it off as they don't actually care who i fall for and that just puts a cherry on my sundae.

My biggest concern though has always been my Nana; as she grew up in a rather strict family.

Anyway this morning I found out that my sister outed me to my Nana over dinner last night (She told me she would do it if i didn't do it by September, it's now October). Turns out she just laughed and said ""I know"".

Update: I feel so unwelcome in LGBTQ spaces,"So the mods of r/bisexual stickied a post saying to stop with the anti pan sentiment. I appreciate this gesture.


However as expected, a good portion of the comments devolved into ""my experience with pan people is *insert negative interaction here*"" and ""but what about when pan people do xyz""?


This just solidified my understanding that we can't have a pan positive post there without some kind of complaint about us. Not even on a post defending us and asking for mutual respect.


I detailed some of my concerns in the comments, and they were down voted. I even had a fellow pan person claim I was doing the same thing I was complaining about, completely ignoring the context of my comment (I asked if it'd be ok if I complained about bi people as they in the sub complain about pan people). I tried to phrase my comments as honest while as respectful as possible.


I guess in that sub, pan people are some kind of annoyance bogeyman. For a sub that claims to include pan people, they sure seem to be apathetic about our concerns. I know the mods can only do so much, but the culture of the sub is disappointing.

Thought I was cis?,"Hello, all!

I'm a cis woman, pansexual, and sapphic.

But I've been wondering about something for a while now but I've always had the desire

to dress and emulate the late great Michael Jackson.

But it's just not the desire to dress like him.

I've wanted to step in his shoes, to be like him.

There's the desire, to dress and emulate him, while charming girls.

Currently, I have a specific person in mind, I'd like to charm her, adopting

MJ's charisma and confidence and dressing similarly.

Also, I've noticed that ever since I started dating women back in 2016, I've also

had the desire to take the protector role in a relationship and being a top.

(I've had two brief relationships where I wanted to protect them, like a guy would

protect his woman in a straight relationship. This is the best way I can describe this-

I apologize if it sounds odd).

I think I could be a switch, but being a ""top"" with a woman or femme-identified individual

makes me really happy more than being their bottom. Just the idea of pleasing them and

making them happy, really makes me happy.

The opposite is true when I'm with a male-identified person, that I feel like I'm easily the ""bottom"".

"It finally hit that my dad will forever see me as someone undeserving of gods love, someone going to hell, and it hurts","I don‚Äôt know where else to post this, so hi.  Venting because I need to somehow go to bed in 40 minutes and it‚Äôs bothering me.

Semi-important background - I was raised Mormon, my mom still is (though less so) and my dad switched to something more extreme via an online preacher.  Think: Obama is the antichrist and Trump was picked by god sort of person.  My uncle on my moms side was gay, and I was able to come out as bi to him before he died (from bipolar disorder 1 and a bad situation, I have bipolar disorder 2, which is a nice added touch because I don‚Äôt know if I feel so upset and panicky because of that).  I‚Äôm exmo and bounce between atheism and Wicca.  I don‚Äôt really care if anyone thinks I‚Äôm going to hell or whatever, but it‚Äôs that my dad thinks I deserve to be punished for eternity for stupid things or things I can‚Äôt control.


I was often told gay people go to hell.  Uncle J is bad and evil and going to hell to *burn*.  When my aunt found out by going through my search history on her computer I got the, ‚Äúwell you can still marry a boy so it‚Äôs ok!‚Äù  I was 13.

I plan on eventually coming out to my mom.  We were talking about something on that topic and I asked what she‚Äôd do if I wasn‚Äôt straight.  She said she would love me still, but she‚Äôd need to process it.  I think that‚Äôs becoming more normal and the right way to deal with that.  I‚Äôm still scared to death, but I want to someday come out to her.

My dad is a completely different story.  My parents know I go to SAFE (LGBT+ club on campus).  I got lots of comments about it, mostly from my dad and his mom.  I have a little pride flag.  I‚Äôve pointed out how excited I was when I saw gay flags in windows in my dorm.  And lord did I hint it.  I think my mom and my grandma have their ideas, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if my aunt told my mom.  But my dad has made it time and time again that it is a terrible thing.  He didn‚Äôt take me being diagnosed with bipolar disorder (basically saying I don‚Äôt have it and that my sibling with BPD doesn‚Äôt have BPD, also got ganged up on with life insurance lady and him that I should just take vitamins since my vitamin D and B12 were low [they‚Äôre better now] and not the medication that keeps me somewhat sane).  What is he going to do if/when he finds out I‚Äôm pan?  Surely I can‚Äôt come out to everyone and have him not find out.

At this point it feels like every important aspect of me my dad would hate me for.  At least the rest of my family would only have an issue with me not being at least something christian.

I always see pan people described as ""snowflake bisexuals"" by other LGBTQ people. Recently on Instagram there was a cute post featuring some LGBTQ flags and people got upset that pan was included. Pan was specifically targeted


Basically I just feel so unwelcome. If pan people generalized other LGBTQ people like they did us, it'd be called out immediately. But when they rant about us and generalize, it's ok??? ""pan people are just snowflake biphobic transphobes"" is a constant sentiment I see spewed by other LGBTQ people and upvoted and I just feel like I'm being stabbed in the back by those I want to support and befriend.

I found out I was Pansexual in IKEA,"That's it, that's the entire story. One day I went to IKEA to get a wardrobe and I saw someone who I was immediately attracted to. I didn't know their gender or anything. I was so confused. They actually came up to me and told me my hoodie was cool, so that was nice, maybe they noticed I was staring at them?

I‚Äôve only dated one person so far in life, so I don‚Äôt really have a concrete example to definitively say.

My husband came out to me,"My husband came out to me as pansexual. It doesn‚Äôt bother at all as I am myself. Before we were together I had been with men women everything. I was honest and straight forwaybefore the relationship started. He had never mentioned it to me. Now after being married he decided to tell me. He wants to experience being with a man. I had also expressed to him I did not want an open relationship before we were together. Im trying to be as supportive as I can be because I want him to have experiences. I suggested we do it together. It wasn‚Äôt god enough. Then I decided I would give him a pass and do his thing. Still not good enough. He‚Äôs now telling me being pansexual means even though we‚Äôre married we can be with whoever we want. He says I‚Äôm not being fair and I‚Äôm wrong and I should let him go off and do whatever he wants. I‚Äôm dumbfounded. Advice?!


UPDATE***

So I now have gotten him to confess that he manipulated me into thinking I‚Äôve changed so much and that I was crazy (have not changed at all) because he wanted me to be different. He told me that I now make him feel embarrassed for coming out to me because I wasn‚Äôt immediately okay with what he wanted. I love him so much and don‚Äôt want to leave. But idk what to do.

Came out to a friend for first time,"I came out to my only friend that I know is nonhomophobic for sure this week. After my parents found out about me being pan via searching my computer without my permission, finding online chats a month ago, and were not accepting, I had been stuck viewing coming out as a sad thing.

  


I decided to come out to my friend voluntarily and it was amazing. He was super accepting and comforting; he is such a great guy.

  


Where I am in North Carolina, and the community I am involved in due to having very Christian parents are not accepting, and he is really the only person I could be confident would still think of me the same.

  


Since I go to a private Christian school, I do run serious risk of being expelled if the administration of the school finds out about my sexuality, but my friend ensured me he would never tell a soul.

  


Every time I think about him knowing this secret I kept for so long and not rejecting me makes me smile involuntarily with happiness. I'm so glad I mustered up the courage to tell him.

  


A memory I will forever remember is him hugging me after reassuring me he thinks no different of me, and just feeling a trust and warmth between him and me I had not felt with anyone in years,y quiet sobs of joy squeezing the hug harder periodically.

  


Thank you all for being here. Knowing that I am not alone or some weird/insane person has kept me sane for all this time. While I have lurked this sub, your existence brought peace to my inner turmoil. Thank you and stay awesome.

Is there really a point?,I'm in my teens and I've identified as bi for something over a year now. I've only ever come out to my best friend irl. For the past couple of months I've been feeling like bi isn't really the best label for me and at this point I'm basically 100% sure I'm pan. But I've been wondering if there's really a point to identifying (and coming out) as pan if in the area I live in most people don't even know/refuse to believe it's possible to be bi so me being pan would confuse them even more. I think even that friend I came out to wouldn't really understand and accept me as he was very sceptical of my sexuality when I came out to him (he kept asking me if I'm sure I'm not or if I'm sure I'm not straight and that kinda stuff). Everyone in my family and most people I know aren't really too fond of LGBTQ+ people and some even hate them. So my question is: Is there really a point?,pansexual
Question for y‚Äôall who understand your sexuality/sexual orientation in general more than I do!,"I‚Äôm 23 and have been trying to figure out my sexuality for years! I‚Äôve tried out a few labels (bisexual, queer, etc) but nothing quite seemed to fit, especially when I‚Äôd talk to people who identified with those. 
Recently my boyfriend suggested I might be pan, but I am having trouble figuring out if that‚Äôs what I am.

A little bit about me-
I have been attracted, emotionally and sexually, to cis men and women as well as trans men and women and people who sit elsewhere on the spectrum, but I have a strong preference for people who have a penis. Like I said, I have been attracted to people with a vagina, but they have been few and far between. Gender identity has zero sway in my attraction, though. 
Does this seem consistent with someone who is pan or if I were pan would I not have as strong of a preference in the persons sex?
Thank you for any insight!",pansexual

A question about preference and sexuality.,"Hello there :) 

I was laying awake and doing some thinking as I often do and asked myself a question that I wasn't able to come up with a satisfactory answer to so I was hoping to get some help from the good people of Reddit!

I've considered myself Pan for a few years now. I've never looked at gender when considering a partner and have been with individuals of varying gender and sexuality. I myself was born and identify as male, I like to be the more dominant and masculine one in a relationship so while I do not look at gender I do often go for people that are more submissive and I guess ""feminine"". 

This may be a totally stupid question but am I correct to consider myself Pansexual if I am attracted to people with more feminine personalities and features regardless of what gender they actually identify as?

Thanks in advance for any answers &lt;3

Edit: Wording.",pansexual

"Well, that escalated quickly. (my first pansexual experience)","Hey all, I've only known the term pansexual a little over a year. I'm a 41(M) and I've lived my entire life as a hetero man, spending the past ten years in a monogamous relationship with a woman, the last five of them very happily married. I've been an ally as much as I'm able to LGBTQ+ communities since a teenager, my wife is queer, and while I've never had a problem identifying people across the gender spectrum as people I'm attracted to, I never gave myself permission to consider that attraction as sexual - it was always an aesthetic appreciation, mixed in with a bit of emotion. TL;DR, I was vanilla as fuck.  


But, I've been unpacking a lot of depression and anxiety over the past few months, and through that unpacking, I've allowed myself to be open to whatever sexual thoughts came through - and realized that I am sexually driven to a lot more variety than I'd given myself credit for. Through this process, my wife and I also made the decision to open our relationship - she wanted to pursue a relationship with a trans woman what she saw could likely turn sexual. I was trepidatious at first, but one of the pillars of our relationship is trusting eachother, but never owning eachother.  


Anyhow, unburdening myself from this sexual anxiety has certainly paid dividends in my mood, and this weekend was the first time I was able to spend time with my wife and her partner without any of my emotional hangups being a stumbling block for everyone in the room resulting in us all in bed together the following morning, having some of the best sex that at least I've ever had. It was my first time with anyone new since I've been in this relationship, my first threesome where everyone walked away happy, my first time expressing attraction to anyone non-binary, and my first sexual experience with a (physically) male body. Lot of firsts, but it was amazing. I don't think I could have ever anticipated being in that place even two months ago.  


And of course a single experience doesn't exactly make me pansexual, or maybe it does, I still have a lot more to explore, but in the meantime I'm in good company for the journey.",pansexual

Today shed some light.. NSFW,"Earlier today at a liquor store that was full of hot broads exchanging looks back and forth with me, my eyes locked in on a guy. He almost looked relieved and gazed back at me. I decided that I'd stand by him to see what vibe there was. The lines of people were insanely long. I told him i wasn't gonna wait through these people and said maybe next time. 3 steps out the door he's out the door and we talk for awhile. He said he was glad i had been checking him out because he had been doing the same on the sly to me. He thought for sure I would've talked to one woman in particular who was hot. I told him I set would've but I wanted him instead. He said oh not as bad as he did me. He said to follow him as he lived close. We get to his place, he introduces me to his gf (I thought wth?) He strips right there as did I.. Hes hairy af which is my biggest pet peeve I'm shaved. He sucks my cock for a few minutes and says to keep it hard he needs the restroom. So his gf who's pretty hot decides she'll continue..well I went totally flaccid. I had no interest in her at all..first time that's happened..its because I wanted him. When he came out I noticed he shaved his cock. His gf said ""damn baby you wouldn't shave for me"" He told her sorry but he and I as soon as we exchanged glances at the liquor store we wanted each other period. He grabbed both our clothes and we went to his man cave like room. He said that all he's done with guys is gotten blowjobs from several. Said he couldn't even think of reciprocating. Drops to his knees and sucks my cock while I talked all dirty. He just took it harder and deeper. Told him I was gonna cum and he pulls my ass in his face flush on my torso. I unloaded a lake and he kept going! I pulled away and pulled him up. I said let's move to couch. On couch I told him that I'm sure I'm pansexual..because I was attracted to him as soon as I saw him. He said when I walked in his eyes went from a chick to me..I told him I went limp when his girl thought she would would take over..he laughed and said WoW..he grabbed my clothes and said we were going to the bedroom. Once there she was playing with a toy in their California king size bed. I lie down on other side and tell him to 69 on top. Then I said to face the other way as I was sure it would be too hard for him blow me as I'd blow him. He tells the girl she can watch or do whatever..so he's in my mouth moaning very loudly and she says about my exposed cock ""WoW thing's huge!"" And proceeds to ride it and both of them are screaming. He cums forever and wobbles off. As soon as he did my cock went totally limp. She said that's cool she'd gotten off. She walked out leaving he and I. He asked if it was okay..I said don't ask go for what know. He starts making out with me and damn that was incredible. I caught my breath and he says ""Omfg you are a boss! I wanna do the whole program with you so you are now the Dom"" hours later he said he's not sure if he's pan or not. I told him hard to tell. Asked if he ever had the experience at the liquor store any other time. He said not even as he never locked eyes with a male before. The guys who blew him usually joined him in tag teaming his gf. But it was The two guys doing her. Then one time dude asks to blow him and he said no..guy says in 2 min if he didn't like it then hed stop. Said the guy was pretty good. Then it happened with different guys a couple dozen he said. One went by and wanted them to 69..my guy said hell no..but he could receive..my guy said 5 min and he was totally not diggin it.. He said he felt weird with the instant attraction as he's never had that happen with another male. So we went for it again..damnit this guy was something! I had to do finally go home..he walked me out and i get in the vehicle. His nosy neighbors were outside he asks me quietly to step out and he locks our mouths and neighbors froze! He told them that I'm the cause of all the noises they heard. Just now he texts ""what happens if I get feelings for you?"" I said we'll cross that bridge when we get to it and we'll deal with it. I asked what did his gf say about it all. He said as long as he fucks her like they have been she's okay with it..hope he keeps that up",pansexual

Acknowledging pan &amp; poly... where to meet like minds?,"I'm a male in my mid 40's, and my closest friends and exes know I'm pan and poly -- a couple were in plural or open relationships with me, though some time ago. But now, years later and having matured (hopefully), I want to get to know others who are open and like-minded -- not necessarily specifically for hook-ups, but for friendship and support, and to see how they themselves have negotiated this voyage of self discovery. 

I originally identified as bi, until I realized my attraction to transgendered and non-binary individuals as well -- hence the embracing of my pan identity.

Where can one meet people and like minds of similar persuasion? I don't drink, so gay bars seem implausible, and though a friend suggested Tinder, I don't know that I'm specifically looking to ""smash"" (his nomenclature)... at least, not immediately.

I have an idea.,"I have an idea.


That idea is complete unity, respect, and solidarity between bisexuals, polysexuals, and pansexuals.



I as a pan person am so tired of seeing anti pansexual sentiment in the queer community, unfortunately often from Bi people. I see ""pansexuals"" referenced as a regressive group who exist solely due to the misrepresentation and erasure of Bi people. I see pansexuals labelled as inherently transphobic/biphobic. I see pansexuals dismissed as ""special snowflakes"".


I as a pan person am so tired of seeing anti bisexual sentiment in the queer community, unfortunately often from pan people. I see bisexuals defined in ways they object to. I see bisexuals labelled as inherently transphobic. I see bisexuals erased and ignored.


I propose a revolution of sorts. This will include understanding that both pansexual and bisexual (and Polysexuals for that matter) are equally valid, real, and belong in the queer community. This will include not labelling bisexuals as regressive or transphobic. This will include not mocking pansexuality or pansexuals for their orientation. This will include understanding that while bisexual, pansexual, and polysexual may overlap in their usage and definitions, that the most important aspect is the human element: our experiences, and our truths.


I propose that instead of bickering over terms, we unite. We all hold very similar problems. We are dismissed by cishet and queer people alike. We are mocked, we are bullied. We have more in common than we know. And while we may have differences in attraction, or in the experiences that led us to the breath of fresh air that is finding a term to fit those experiences, we are stronger together.



Pansexuals are valid.
Polysexuals are valid.
Bisexuals are valid.


We own language. Language does not own us.


I may not understand, as a pan person, why someone is bisexual or Polysexual. And they may not understand pansexuality. But I trust that they know themselves and their lives. I only ask that they do the same for me, and that other pan people do the same for them.

People mislabeling your sexuality; do you correct them?,"Hey guys. Long time Reddit lurker, finally bit the bullet and made an account recently. On mobile so I apologize if this isn‚Äôt formatted correctly. 

Grew up in a very liberal community and have always been fortunate to have open minded, accepting friends and family but never personally met another person who identifies as pansexual. In the last few years I‚Äôve gradually gravitated towards sexual experiences with men (I identify as male) and recently entered a serious relationship with a really incredible guy. 

For anybody in a similar situation, do people/friends close to you often refer you you as gay? I‚Äôve had gay and straight friends alike label me (ie ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you‚Äôre gay.‚Äù Etc) in innocuous ways. And while I personally don‚Äôt really care about labels, there‚Äôs a part of me that feels like a part of my identity is being erased. I‚Äôll likely be with my current boyfriend indefinitely, but in my mind, that still doesn‚Äôt change how I identify. 

Just curious to hear anybody else‚Äôs thoughts or if anyone else has dealt with this before! ",pansexual

Not so Cool things on the coming out road

By Rive Jon.

\*\*warning\*\* the following article is based on my personal experience, in this article I will talk about feminism, toxic masculinity, gender identity, gender expression and other things you may disagree with or by trigger by. and if you keep reading this is under your own will and I‚Äôm not considered responsible for how you fell about it, consider yourself warn 

A lot of good and nice things have come out of my coming out experience, but I have to be brutally honest with you my friends, I also had to face a lot of unbelievable nastiness and the ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù of those things had been overwhelming at times, actually it has made me re think a lot of my positions in regards of gender issues, toxic masculinity and a lot of things a used to do as a heterosexual cisgender male, but that‚Äôs is something to write about in another articles, even 2 more; this article is about some of the thing I had to face as a Pansexual and I‚Äôm sure that everyone can relate with my position.

Before we dive into the ‚Äúnot cool‚Äù let me reveal a bit more about my past.  Back in the day I had a lot of misconceptions in regard of gender identity and sexual orientation, despite my psychological background I was the kind of person that would say ‚Äúpersonally I don‚Äôt agree but I respect your choice‚Äù, looking back at it I realized how many levels of wrong there is in it, beginning by realizing that the ‚Äúpersonally‚Äù is a really condescending thing to say; second: is not a choice, I don‚Äôt chose whom I fell attracted to like a chose my cloths, and thinking that adding the ‚ÄúI respect‚Äù don‚Äôt make the sentence a good thing to say, but here‚Äôs is a catch;  I wasn‚Äôt trying to be disrespectful I was just ignorant, I didn‚Äôt had bad intentions, just didn‚Äôt have information, and now that I‚Äôm in the other side of the sidewalk I am more compressive about being ignorant about something but not being mean spirited, and for the most par that is cool, I will deal with that because I know they intention is not to harm me.

With that being said, I want to let you know that some of the ‚Äúnot cool‚Äù things I will talk about are also based on lack of knowledge, and some of the people that do this things are not really bad, but still doing that is not right and can make some persons feel really uncomfortable; also, if it turns out that you are someone that happens to do some of thins things probably it will be a chance to challenge and reconsidered  some of your position the same way I did.

And now, not cool.      

1¬∞ apparently I don‚Äôt ‚Äúexist‚Äù and Pansexuality doesn‚Äôt exit.

This is the first thing I had to face joining the LGBT community, the fact was a lot of hate and misinformation about what being pansexual means, and I was shock to find that inside the LGBT community there is a lot of people that still don‚Äôt believe that pansexuality, or other forms of sexual orientation other than homo, hetero and bi, can exists, and not just that, I respect every person right to believe whatever they want, but they can also get really cruel and it goes from denying that pansexuality exist to insult someone just because how this person really is. 

Needless to say that I was also victim of insults and other nasty thing throw at me and a lot of people more just because our my sexual orientation, which is something we don¬¥t choose, is just the way we are, the way I am, and to be in denial of that, witch I was most part my life, is something really harmful and painful, it left a vacuum in my heart that I tried to fill with other people attention and love, and now just because a group of persons don‚Äôt agree or don¬¥t like it they are going to deny my existence and my identity, no not haven it,  that‚Äôs not right;  and is up to defense our right to an identity and to have our existence acknowledge, there‚Äôs progress but there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do and everywhere there‚Äôll be people that is toxic and harmful, and is up to us to confront all the hate.

2¬∞ Just because I‚Äôm Pan does not mean I‚Äôm attracted to everyone or I want to have sex with everyone .

One of the first things I did was create a Facebook account to interact in pansexual groups and such (by the way if you want to send me friend request at Riv√© Jon, my profile is the one with the Pan flag over my face), and for the most part is actually really nice to interact, I love this new Facebook, but with it has also come a lot of terrible things, that include being a victim of toxic masculinity from another perspective, ever since I open that new Facebook account I had been getting a lot of people whom want to have cybersex with me, down right to send me dick pics or offer me money for doing so, witch I have nothing angst if someone does it, except for the fact that at any moment I said I wanted to do that, one person even try take advantage of the fact that I live in Venezuela by saying that because I live in a poor country he‚Äôs doing me a favor offering me money for showing myself on cam, ok if you want to pay for cybersex go to chaturbate or something, but is not OK to hustle a person to do so, other guy got angry at me because I didn‚Äôt want to be his boyfriend, we live in two different countries and the most important part, I DON¬®T KNOW HIM!  and other guy began to throw insults at me because I didn‚Äôt want to suck his ‚Ä¶. until he ‚Ä¶.., you probably get the idea;  that time I lost my temper and speak out my mind to that son of a ‚Ä¶.. Sorry but remember all of this makes me angry again, anyway, just because some is pansexual or on a LGBTQ+ page or group or anything doesn¬¥t mean that this person wants to have sex or see unwanted private parts pictures it doesn¬¥t matter how ‚Äúin need‚Äù the other person might be is a disrespectful thing to do and it can really get in someone mind.

After all that I went to talk to my BFF and told her all the harassment I got online, and her response was, ‚Äúbaby that happened to me all the time, almost every day there is an idiot that think because he want I must show him my parts, and after some time it really gets in to your head‚Äù and just the idea of having to experience that for most of my life made felt ill.  Until that point I knew that cyber harassment was a issue, specially to women, but is not the same to know that happens, that to experience the gross and discuss caused by that, and to think that women all around the world had to put with all the toxic and ugly behavior and things we men do to them, is not right, is just not, and now that I‚Äôm more aware of that I can¬¥t keep being part of that, and I must do something about it.        

This is for today, I know is kind of short but this 2 are the most annoying and shocking things I had to face so far, and in regard of se the second it actually had change my view on women issues and feminism, this journey has been full of surprises so far, and again I can only say how happy I am to make it,  I‚Äôm sure that with time a lot more will come up, and you can bet that I‚Äôll be ready for it.

Until next time my loves, take care.",pansexual

STEM - Research for Diversity in LGBTQ+,"Dear Reddit Users -
  
I wanted to pass along an invitation that you can extend to your colleagues, students, and other interested parties which offers the opportunity to participate in a current research study. 

To be included in the study participants must be at least 18 years of age, live in the United States, and are engaged in a Science, Engineering, Technology, or Math (STEM) field. We have included those engaged in STEM fields to encompass advanced graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, academic faculty, researchers, and industry professionals..
 
We are conducting this study to better understand the degree to which lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, or asexual (LGBTQA) diversity, and commitment to diversity were predictive of workplaces that fostered creativity in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. This will entail your completion of online surveys. Your participation is expected to take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. The content of the surveys should cause no more discomfort than you would experience in your everyday life.

You can find the survey on Qualtrics and complete the survey at any time. The link is below:

My pansexual diary N¬∞ 2 Exploring my sexuality without having sex.,"Last time I talk about my sexuality I said I still was having problems accepting that I like men, a part of me still fell that is wrong, homosexuality is wrong and all that ‚Äúlovely stuff‚Äù (Being sarcastic) so I decided to do something about and explore my attraction to males, so that I can feel comfortable with this part of me and my first idea was, ‚Äúget in grinder, date a bunch of guys go slow and you‚Äôll feel comfortable about liking men‚Äù, that didn‚Äôt go well.

First, for some reason most of the guys here that use grinder just want to have sex, we don‚Äôt know each other and even when I agree to see them they wanted to have sex right away and without protection, so that‚Äôs a ¬°BIG NO! for me, anyway it was a bad idea, and about  1 week of the same thing I drop the plan, and then I had another idea, and ¬°spoilers! this was really good idea.

What I did was using my psychology background to analyze the origin of my rejection towards my homosexual feeling, that‚Äôs where all the thing I said about what I was dealing with in the last post came from, to make a long story short it came from my family, specially my dad and his homophobia, and I guess I always knew I had some of that same sex attraction in me and if he find out he will hate me the same way he hates gay people, so I was conditioned to give a certain response, and that was rejection towards homosexual feelings, thought and behaviors.

And with that out of the way I just need it a ‚Äúintervention plan‚Äù to decondition myself, now that I know where my rejection came from I could move forward and face it, not as the child afraid to be rejected  but as the adult that need to accept himself the way he is, and decided to explore my sexuality without having sex, instead what I did was progressively tell myself that I‚Äôm and adult, this is part of me and that as an adult is fine to find men attractive, and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun giving me the freedom to find men attractive, also it feels so good! The down side of things is that I still live with my parents and I‚Äôm still really afraid to tell them because I don‚Äôt have anywhere to go and with the current crisis we are living I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to someone else, but fear not my friends, I‚Äôm a man with a plan, and things will come my way one way or another.

That‚Äôs it for today, there‚Äôs still more thing to talk about this journey, and hopefully I‚Äôll wright about it soon.     ",pansexual

My Pansexual diary," About a week ago I finally come to terms with my sexual orientation, it wasn¬¥t an easy thing to do, I had to overcome a lot of problems and personal issues regarding who I feel attracted to and the way I view myself, I also had to face a lot of things I was trying to run away from, and still carry some of it with me, again not easy to overcome, and yet, I never felt more happy in my life, I finally know who I am, I feel complete, and these days every time a had been stress out, or angry, I just come back to this and fill my hart with love and joy.  
So I want to share with you, my beloved friends, some of the things I had to overcome, both as a personal exercise facing them and as a testimonial (for lack of a better word) to whomever is going through something similar.  
So first a grew up in a traditional and strict home, my parents are not very religious, yet they were very strict in regards gender stereotypes, I usually was punish for showing ‚Äúinappropriate behaviors for a men‚Äù, of course that and other things made me a very confused, insecure and sad person, Enter college at age 22, still not a single clue of who or what I am, but something happened, I had to live on the campus and was the first time I wasn\`t living with my parents and began to felt weird, I noticed that I felt attracted to men, I found trans woman more attractive than most ciswoman I knew at the time, also felt strongly attracted to tomboys gender fluid, gender neutral, bigender, and trans men; I didn\`t now about the gender spectrum at the time, (if I‚Äôm misusing a particular gender please let me know and apologies in advance) The point is I felt all this emotional and sexual attraction, it was crazy strong, and also felt guilty for having them, because I wasn\`t ‚Äúbehaving like a men‚Äù; in fact my first same sex experience was in college but because of the guilt a felt I didn¬¥t enjoy it, yet I was always going back for more.  
It took 9 years for me to accept that I can‚Äôt fit into one category, no matter how hard I try, that I don\`t have to feel guilt because whom I fell attracted to, that is normal that I find attractive ‚Äúmasculine women, and feminine men‚Äù, that is ok that I find more attractive no binary, gender fluid or queer, or simply that I can like someone regardless gender or sexual orientation.

I would see a person who I think looks beautiful and they would tell me that they wouldn't like me because there trans! Now a few years ago I would have said that I didn't like them anymore but now I still have an attraction to them even if there trans or non-binary!

So am I bisexual or am I pansexual? And due to things that have happened before we're I've mistyped some stuff, im telling you that I'm not trying to be negative towards trans people or non-Binary people ",pansexual

Because we are trying to make something different than other LGBT+ servers.

Need some help,"So, I'm a 26 (going on 27) year old male (I identify as gender fluid though), and though I've identified as pansexual since I was about 16 I feel like I've always leaned in the asexual side of things.

What I'm wanting help with though, is asking if it's possible for sexual behaviors to be learned unnaturally, as I also have problems with rage (tied to an abusive childhood) and it's always had a strong tie to my sexual drives. Mentally, I don't like the idea of sex and never really have, but for some reason my mind has been stuck on sex to a perverted degree, and it's never felt natural to me.

So in short, is it possible I've been identifying wrong for 11 years, or something else of that nature?",pansexual

I see intimacy and love though a lens of fluidity. Currenty finding my place in the world of polyamory/non-monogamy and exploring my sexuality.

Struggling with my Identity. Help! (x-post from r/bisexual),"Hi Folks,

Sorry in advance if this ends up being quite a lengthy post or if it sounds like I am rambling. I have been going through a lot of late and I want to state my case as much as I can and as clearly as I can in order to get any advice or help.

To start this off let me bring you up to speed with who I am. I'm 28, male and in a long term hetro relationship. I have always considered myself somewhere on the spectrum of bi/pan-sexuality but I have never confided in, or expressed this with anyone in my life outside the small handful of bi/pan sexual encounters that I have engaged in years ago.

***The reason for this I*** ***put this down to:***

**1)** My Rural/Catholic Upbringing.

**2)** The fact that I am not emotionally or romantically attracted to men.

Number 1 is obvious. It's hard to find understanding and acceptance about something that may seem ""out of the norm"" in my setting growing up which is unfortunately the same story time and time again for all of us.

Number 2, I never felt that I was ""full on bi/pan"" (whatever that means) as I would be attracted to and would connect emotionally, romantically, physically and sexually with Women but I would from time to time get ***SUPER*** horny in changing rooms, showers, thinking about cock, etc.

So in my later teen years I experimented a few times by connecting with some guys here and there for a little bit of experimentation. During these years I got to explore what turned me on and what didn't. I would engage, swap and receive all the fun (safe) sexual acts with men but I could never get behind or enjoy any emotional attachment, kissing, making out, romance etc. As a matter of fact, as soon as the deed was done so to speak, I would be gone like a thief in the night and wouldn't return to my attraction or inclination of men for a few weeks or months after. What is interesting looking back on this period of my life now is that I still all along was engaging in relations with Women, some of the times I met with men we watched straight porn together and I connected and hooked up a few times with a transgender (mtf) Woman. So all along I was under the impression that I was straight but my own little dirty secret was that I would get my rocks off from time to time with guys or male reproductive organs if the occasion came up.

I then ended up meeting a wonderful Woman, we hit it off like a house of fire, had a whirlwind romance, did long distance for a few years, I ended up moving to be with her, pursued a life together and have had a great time so far and have engaged in this relationship now for about 7 years. I would reflect on my experimentation as a younger man and as so many others tragically dismiss our orientation, I deemed it all as a phase. (D'oh!)

However, for the past few months now I have been going through spats of anxiety, alientation and feeling lost from a culmination of a few things that I am putting down to a Third-Life Crisis. I am starting to wonder if I am where I should be in life right now emotionally, professionally, and geographically. I am also reflecting on my current relationship which is with a Wonderful, Kind, Loving Woman and wondering if it is right for me for now, the near future and for life?! Nothing major has changed in our relationship but I just feel that recently for a while now we have not been gelling and have been noticing some drifting apart and disinterest creeping in. She had mentioned last night about behaving more like roommates more than anything else recently.

With all of this comes the realisation after lurking this subreddit for a while now that I am Bi/Pan. A dead giveaway for this now in hindsight is that I have really never stopped in fantasizing and masturbating to bi, and trans porn since I started seeing my partner. I now know that I need to address this and I need to grow into this new realization and acceptance of who I am. I understand that the first matter to address is sitting down with my partner and having that classic conversation.

I can't tell with my partner if it's a case of the chicken or the egg but I feel like my sexuality is linked to all of this. Either with our strained relationship comes wonderment of my sexuality and if I need to explore my sexuality more to know what I want in life. Or is it that the prospect of continuing a long-term relationship is scaring me as I will always have an unfulfilled longing for living my life as an open, single bi-male and this is leading to me becoming distant in my current relationship.

If you've read this far, you have my heart. I love you and thank you for wanting to know more about what I am going through. All I ask is if you have any advice, pearls of wisdom, support, love.

Thank You. &lt;3",pansexual
"Attracted to genders in different ways, but also kinda demi? Please help me figure me out.","Hi, woman over 30 here, only recently heard of demisexual and while I identify as that, I also wanted to know if there's a better way to identify how I feel. 

I only crush on guys romantically. But I don't even want to see them naked, until I have a strong emotional bond with them. So I've just figured I'm a hetero- demi? But I also see women and think ""hot damn, I wanna touch"". So maybe I'm bi... but maybe homosexual and demi-heterosexual? What? 

And when I get really close to someone, regardless of gender, I just want to shower them with kisses and cuddle and touch. The urge is really strong regardless of their relationship to me, like friends or family members. But with women I don't want to date or have sex. Just kiss and touch.

College Roommate Trouble,"So I‚Äôll preface this by saying I‚Äôm a guy going into second year of university. I‚Äôve known I was at least bisexual for about four or five years now, but I haven‚Äôt been really open about it since I live in a pretty conservative area and I don‚Äôt want to deal with that drama. But now I go to school in a crazy liberal area and I finally feel like I can be open about myself, which is great!

I ended up rooming with a guy with a lot of similar interests to me, so we were playing some video games with some of my friends and I wanted to test the waters a bit, see how ok he would be with my sexuality. Long story short, I make a couple jokes about being spit-roasted, he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd obviously prefer it if you weren‚Äôt gay,‚Äù I laugh it off, end of subject.

We move in together in the fall, I don‚Äôt mention I‚Äôm pansexual since I don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable (we‚Äôre going to be living together for a year and all), and it‚Äôs not like it had the opportunity to come up since I‚Äôm not exactly ‚Äúsexually active‚Äù by no choice of my own. But basically all freshman year I‚Äôve only gone on dates with women and I feel super closeted since I don‚Äôt even have any queer friends and I hadn‚Äôt ventured into the LGBT+ dating scene at all.

Because of a number of circumstances (mostly study abroad), I‚Äôm not going to be rooming with any of my friends next year, so I‚Äôm in the luck of the draw. I‚Äôve got no clue who my roommate is going to be, but most likely it‚Äôll be a guy around my age, probably a year younger, and because of statistics he‚Äôll also probably be straight (even if he‚Äôs not nothing sexual would likely happen since that could lead to some messy situations).

I want my roommate to know what I‚Äôm about, but I also don‚Äôt want to make it weird for him. I know I shouldn‚Äôt care, I normally don‚Äôt, but being someone‚Äôs college roommate is a long-term agreement not to make the other overly uncomfortable. God forbid my roommate‚Äôs a total conservative, but does anyone have any experience or advice with this?",pansexual

She‚Äôs not particularly hateful, but she‚Äôs not open minded either. We‚Äôve had conversations about this issue and she has clearly stated that she believe homosexuality is a sin, but that she doesn‚Äôt believe gay people are bad people just because they‚Äôre gay. I‚Äôm going to come out to her though because I love her as a friend and I want to be able to be open with who I am with her. But I was thinking - should I say I‚Äôm pan or bi?

I've read about the bi cycle and was wondering if this is my case or something else. More so, does anyone have advice on how to deal live with this fluctuation without it causing chaos to my relationship? ",pansexual
So I ended up coming out to my parents. And they said I'm too young to be any type of gay.,"\[SORRY ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I'M REALLY PISSED ABOUT THIS\]

Like, what the hell parents!? I'm 15, I've known this since I was about 13, and I've had many boyfriends, and I know that I'm into guys. I still like girls, and there have been a few other people out there like transgenders, or even non binary people. I know that I'm pan.

You people say that you will love and accept me no matter what, and they you go and say ""Oh, it's probably temporary. Your hormones are out of control at this age, who knows what's going through your head."" and ""In this day and age, you shouldn't *WANT* to be gay. There's tons of discrimination out there.""

Big fucking emphasis on the ""want to be gay."" Okay, okay, first of all, fuck you. I can't fucking help it. I like guys. That's just who I am. Could you people help that you abused me and my sister until we were 9 and 10, and  had to take our money to pay bills because you spent the rest on alcohol? Yes, you could. I can't help it that I'm into dick. There's a fine line between being able to control something, and not having a choice. I don't have a choice. Like I said it's who I am.

Why can't you guys just be like my other friends' parents? They all came out to their parents at least a couple years ago. Their parents didn't say any of this kind of shit when they were 13 and 14 and came out to their parents. They're parents went on knowing happily that their child is gay. I wasn't able to at that time because my junior high was fucking rough. My anxiety, stress, and depression levels were at an all time high back then. I couldn't even think about coming out to you guys.

All of friends are happily living with their parents. I hate you two so fucking much I can't even describe it. You won't let me just, be me. I can't wait for the next couple years so I can get the fuck out of this place as soon as possible.

Sorry about that, r/pansexual! I was just in need of a rant. I'm just so confused, mad, depressed, and not even sure what else, about why my parents are like this. I know my dad is a bit of a homophobe, but just my mother. She never showed any signs of anything. She seemed like she would be perfectly happy with one of us being gay. But I guess not.

But thank you to whoever reads this. I just wanted to rant. If you could give any type of feedback, that would be great.

Bye bye!! :\)

\[UPDATE\] \- Thanks you guys so much!! You all are such amazing people, and you helped me get through a tough time. 

This community is probably one of my new favorite places ever, and I love you all, thank you. You people made me better. Thanks. I say thanks a lot.",pansexual

Should I come out to my parents as pansexual or bisexual (to make sure they understand),"Hey there! I've decided I want to come out to my parents and close friends. I feel like I should come out to my parents first. I'll turn 18 in a month, waited two years, and originally I wanted to wait another year but I really want to open up to them.

The question is, should I come out to my parents as pansexual or bisexual. The problem is, my parents aren't educated on the matter and I'm 100&amp;#37; sure they haven't heard of pansexuality. They, at least my more open\-minded father might  know about bisexuality, but it's not the same! And I would erase my own sexuality. Another problem is, that we aren't English and they don't speak English, so I couldn't provide them resources on pansexuality.

Why Pansexuals Should Be Feminists,"Although some feminists have dismissed pansexuality as anti-feminist, I do not think such a criticism is true, and thus I do not think that it should deter pansexuals from feminism. Firstly, in regard to the critique of pansexuality stating that pansexuality is anti-feminist, I would say that it is feminist for women to be honest and to be encouraged to be honest about their sexual orientation. Perhaps the implication of this critique may be that a woman in a relationship with a man and/or a non-binary person, and/or who has the potential to be in a relationship with a man and/or a non-binary person, is subjecting herself to sexism.  To the contrary, I would say that there is really little point to feminism if one believes that all men and/or non-binary people are necessarily going to be sexist no matter what. How can women have equal rights if all such people, who are approximately half the population, are never going to support that? If the implication is that a woman in a relationship with someone who is not a woman is taking her time and energy away from women and/or feminism, I would say that nobody can spend all their time and energy in the service of any cause, and that having a relationship with a woman is not necessarily helping feminism, as women can be sexist and refuse to support feminism, and as encouraging women to not have relationships with people they are attracted to and not be honest about their sexual orientation is not feminist, as it restricts those women‚Äôs freedoms and diminishes their happiness without advancing women‚Äôs rights. It is for these reasons I oppose political lesbianism and political asexuality (which are sometimes considered part of feminism), and would oppose political pansexuality and political heterosexuality were they to exist, which to my knowledge they do not.  

I would also like to point out that many important feminists are (or were while they were alive) pansexuals, such as Greta Christina. Lesbians have often not been able to live off of men‚Äôs money, while heterosexual women sometimes have (and have been encouraged and pressured to), and thus in that respect the rights of women to keep their own money, go into high-earning professions, etc. have sometimes been more urgently needed for lesbians than for heterosexual women; for pansexual women such a difference would largely depend on whether they were in relationships with men or not (with pansexual polyamory being the sole possible exception to such considerations). Lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in The Lesbian Heresy (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with pansexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to sexually harass women, pansexual men are just as likely to be bothersome to women as heterosexual men. (She uses the word bisexual here, but I define bisexuality and pansexuality to both mean a sexual orientation where one is attracted to people of the gender one is and of all other genders; in any case a bisexual man would by definition be attracted to some women, which is what Jeffreys is stating is problematic here.) I would dispute this assertion. I think that sexual harassment is not usually an expression of sexual desire (after all, if  someone wants to sexually entice a woman, they probably know harassment will not work) but  rather a way to insult and/or intimidate women, and thus gay men are sadly as motivated to perform it as pansexual and straight men.  

In regard to the critique of pansexuality stating that bisexuality is a type of false consciousness, let me first state that false consciousness is a way of thinking that prevents a person from perceiving the true nature of their social or economic situation. So, even if a person is truly pansexual as shown by their sexual arousal, it could possibly be preventing them from perceiving the true nature of their social situation - for example, it could possibly be preventing women from perceiving the way they are oppressed by men. In regard to this argument, I would state that if women could not perceive oppression by men if they were sexually attracted to men or in a sexual and/or romantic relationship with a man, feminism would never have arisen among heterosexual or pansexual women, and yet it clearly has. 

Lesbian feminist Julie Bindel has described female pansexuality as a ‚Äúfashionable trend‚Äù being promoted due to ‚Äúsexual hedonism‚Äù and broached the question of whether pansexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of pansexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. (Again, she uses the term bisexual, but I use the term pansexual, and I believe we are referring to the same thing.) In response to all this I would say that there are still places where pansexuality is not accepted and yet people continue to come out as pansexual there, as they did before pansexuality was considered chic at all in any place. So I would say that this proves pansexuality really exists, inasmuch as such an internal identity can be proven.
  
As for the argument that pansexual women who pursue relationships with men are ‚Äúdeluded and desperate‚Äù, as some lesbian feminists claim, I would state that there is nothing more deluded and desperate about entering relationships with men than there is about entering relationships with women or non-binary people. People of all genders are capable of being sexist and otherwise abusive to female partners, and people of all genders are capable of being feminist and otherwise supportive to female partners. One‚Äôs partner(s) should be chosen as individuals ‚Äì asserting that women are inherently superior to men and/or non-binary people in any way is sexist, and it is not helpful to women to do so. Indeed, asserting that women are better partners inherently could keep women from working to become better partners, as they would be assured that they are inherently that way and need not make sure they are treating their partner(s) as an equal (or equals), supporting them, and so on. Asserting that women are inherently morally superior has also been historically used to deny women rights ‚Äì the idea that women are too ‚Äúpure‚Äù to sully themselves with politics was used as an argument against women‚Äôs suffrage, for example. The idea that women are inherently feminist or otherwise inherently superior partners to men and/or non-binary people could also be used to argue that women should devote themselves to relationships rather than careers, a common anti-feminist position.  

Panphobia and the refusal to accept pansexuality is also an anti-feminist position not only for the reasons I have already given but because rejection of male pansexuality is often tied to rejection of men perceived too effeminate, a patently anti-feminist position in its disparagement of qualities associated with women. The idea that a man who has qualities associated with women, such as attraction to men, is inferior has also been used to disparage feminist men who are supportive of their girlfriends and/or wives, as seen for example in the misogynist term  ‚Äúpussy-whipped‚Äù. A pansexual man, I would hasten to add, is not inherently any more likely to be feminist or effeminate than a straight or homosexual man; it is only that the rejection of pansexual men due to the perception of them as effeminate is anti-feminist.  

As for cyberfeminism in particular, I note that Donna Haraway‚Äôs 1985 essay ‚ÄúA Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century‚Äù, which was the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism, states that the cyborg ‚Äúhas no truck with [pan]sexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.‚Äù (Again, she uses the term bisexual, but I use the term pansexual, and I believe we are referring to the same thing.) However, I would say that this is wrong because pansexuality is a sexual orientation, a harmless attraction some people simply have, not something they try to have or do in order to create organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity. Therefore, I would say that cyborgs can be pansexual, and cyberfeminism can and should be accepting of pansexuality. 

The rejection of pansexuality in women by lesbian separatists is more complicated. I would  say that if lesbian separatists believe that men and/or non-binary people are inherently anti-feminist, this is disproved by the examples of feminist men, and also this belief does not logically lead to founding lesbian- only spaces in a male-dominated society, because in such as society (for example, the United States) men will still control most of the society and men could therefore impinge upon even the most isolated commune with laws, not to mention lowering its potential membership through convincing women that lesbianism is a sin. Yet if lesbian separatists wish to have lesbian-only spaces simply to be among like-minded people, while not seeing pansexual people as inherently anti-feminist, or believing that lesbian-only spaces can truly be insulated from male culture, I do not see anything panphobic or anti-feminist in that. 

I think I have shown in this essay why pansexuality is not anti-feminist and therefore need not be rejected by feminists; now, let me show how pansexuals can benefit from feminism. Firstly, as I have already mentioned, the rejection of pansexual men due to the perception of them as effeminate is anti-feminist. Feminism can help fight this by fighting the perception of all feminine things as inherently inferior to all masculine things, which comes from the idea that women are inherently inferior to men (though I do not deny that some particular things considered feminine, such as being paid low wages, are in fact inferior to their masculine counterparts, it is not so for all things considered feminine, such as being sexually attracted to men.)

Secondly and most importantly when considering how pansexuals can benefit from feminism, feminism can raise women to the same status as men and non-binary people, which will make it easier to have equal relationships with either or both regardless of one‚Äôs own gender.

"Soooo... I want to come out to the rest of my friends.

All of my past relationships, at least the ones they know about (I've been in relationships with a few guys and one non-binary person) have been with someone of the opposite sex.

Overall, I really *do* want to come out to them.  Just knowing them though, they're pretty awkward people. I don't want to make things weird when it comes to all of us.

Internalized homophobia and sexual satisfaction,"Hello!

I'm an undergraduate student in France doing a psychology project analyzing the correlation of internalized homonegativty and sexual satisfaction among people who identify as bisexual, pansexual, bi-curious, and fluid. To gather data, I'm doing a survey (link below) addressing this very question.

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qmUFu7yjjfFrOWe1eICnjODTMsw00d1LRyZR4WXAjPs/viewform?edit_requested=true

The survey is very brief, containing only 4 questions which can be filled out in just a couple of minutes. If you are interested in filling it out, there are only two requirements: that you have had sexual experiences with both men and woman, and that you identify with one of the sexual identities listed above.

""Sexual experience"" is defined as anything involving genital or anal contact. Vaginal and anal penetration (including with toys), oral stimulation, genital rubbing, mutual or allo-masturbation -- all are considered sexual experiences for the purposes of this survey.

The survey is open for both cis, trans, and genderqueer people. However, because of uncertainty about whether a sufficient number of trans and genderqueer people can be collected, I have decided to collapse both categories in one group, though they remain divided by their assigned birth gender. I expect gathering data for at least 20 people in each gender category (cis women, trans and genderqueer AMAB, etc.). If I succeeded, I would absolutely love to disclose and discuss the findings with you guys!

The idea for this project came from [this study, performed by Kuyper and Vanwesenbeeck (2011).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20191420) Using a population survey of Dutch respondents, Kuyper and Vanwesenbeeck (2011) analyzed the impact of internalized homonegativty on a variety of health outcomes for people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. They found that internalized homonegativity interacted with the sexual satisfaction of lesbians, gay men, and bisexual women, but its most pronounced effect was on bi men.

A more recent survey has confirmed that internalized homonegativity in gay men and lesbians is not significantly correlated with sexual enjoyment or satisfaction, but the findings in regards to bisexual people awaits replication. Plus, no surveys have studied the correlation between these two variable with non-monosexual people who do not identify as cissexual. And finally, Kuyper and Vanwesenbeeck (2011) did not see how internalized homonegativity interacts separately with sexual satisfaction in opposite-sex and same-sex encounters.

My project is, I believe, the first step to attempting to address these matters, which I think are so interesting for those of us in the bi/fluid spectrum... But for it to succeed, you need to fill it out... ;-)",pansexual

I ‚Äúcame out‚Äù to my parents.,"So the situation is a bit messed up but let me explain some background first. I am a 16 female and right now I live in Dubai witch does not accept non heterosexual people easily. 

I‚Äôm pretty open about my sexuality with anyone except my family , it‚Äôs not that I ashamed of it I‚Äôm just afraid of their reaction because it‚Äôs theirs that matter. Since I‚Äôm open about it it was in my bio for twitter and while my dad was snooping around my phone he found it.

It probably was my fault but I am still mad because my dad did not come to me and talk about it he outed me to my mother , the person who‚Äôs opinion I feared the most. And my fears did non disappoint me. My parents did not react well.

My Dad was mad , but not for the fact that I was pansexual , he completely ignored that and still does, he was mad that I was so public about it in the country we live in. I don‚Äôt know if he would have been mad if we still lived in our previous country where same sex marriage is allowed but I probably won‚Äôt know. Since then he hasn‚Äôt brought it up  and keeps pestering me about boyfriends not even considering it might be any other gender.

My mom on the other hand is quite complicated. At first she screamed , a lot, she even called me disgusting. Once that screaming match was done she ignored the subject for 2 weeks. Then out of nowhere while I was watching netflix in my living room , she asked how I knew I was pansexual if i never dated the same gender. I told her that I don‚Äôt need to date to know if I am attracted to the same gender.(I was attracted to the same gender since I was 6, my first crush was a girl), she did not react to it well again and was mad about it screaming for a bit and the grounding me.

"Looking for volunteers to complete a short survey on the ""coming out"" process for a research project","Hey, everyone!

I am a graduate student in clinical psychology at a university in Canada, and I am working on a brief class project that discusses family therapy in the context of an adolescent (or young adult) who has recently come out to his or her parents.

My main goal is to conduct a review on the types of conflict that occur when coming out, and the therapies that may be appropriate to help a family to adjust. However, a lot of the research on this topic is very old, and possibly outdated!

She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre such a good mom and i didn‚Äôt have to be scared to tell you‚Äù. Made me tear up. We try to have open honest communication in our home at all times.

I just wish she would clean up after herself. Lol!",pansexual
Confused about what I am. Mildly NSFW maybe.,"I consider myself pansexual because I have become sexually aroused thinking about having sex and actually having sex with any/all genders, but I'm honestly wondering if I may be... partially asexual. Is that even a thing??

The reason I'm confused is that I have had romantic and sexual relationships with men and women, but never for my physical pleasure. I rarely notice my own physical pleasure and never focus on it. I masturbate, but only for the quick orgasm and never for the extended pleasure of it. I love sex with a partner, but couldn't care less about my own orgasm and I get really anxious when the focus is on me. I have had orgasms with partners before, but they were kind of disappointing. I've had way more satisfying sex sessions that did not include my orgasms.

Also, I very, very rarely have sexual thoughts about random people walking around. Sometimes I'm like ""Oh wow, he/she is fine!"" But it's more in an admiring way. I do notice, however, when I work out consistently for a few weeks I start noticing women a LOT compared to how often I usually notice them.

I am on the autism spectrum and I have realised that a big part about what I love about sex is that there is very little guesswork to be done. I KNOW when I've  done the right thing. I don't have to worry about not doing or saying the right thing or missing signs. Body language is very easy for me to read during sex, and it makes me feel incredibly successful when I make my partner orgasm. It's like a social interaction I'm actually good at.

So I'm just confused and I wanted to get all that out. Whew, I feel better!",pansexual

help! am i pansexual? or bicurious? or bisexual? or no label?,"i would say i was essentially hetero. i like men, i have only had full on sexual contact with men. i have kissed girls (but mostly girl friends when im too drunk, not the attention seeking ""lets turn on men"" type, just its happened and ok that happened).

i find girls attractive and i feel like i find them attractive in a sexual way. but at the same time, i dont know if i could do sexual acts with a girl?

does this make sense?

is it just me being unexperienced and nervous (similar to when youve not lost your virginity and youre like aaahhhh) or is it more i like the idea of women but im not actually sexual attracted?

what does that make me?

(when i say men or women i refer to anyone refers to who identifies as male or female or other, so biological/trans/agender etc. sorry if im not being inclusive, i am new to all this. i just know that i dont mind if someone doesnt identify with their biological birth assigned gender, i just dont know if i am only sexually attracted to those who identify as male or if im curious or actually attracted to those who are female/identify as female, or other.)",pansexual

So I've identified as bi until now but....I'm confused.,"This is where I get confused re: labeling myself:

I find a certain kind of maleness very sexy, so that would be the ""masculine/male"" gender. So I'm not ""gender blind"" to masculinity and I often find it very attractive in and of itself. I feel like this way about femininity too.

But then again, I also am attracted to people who are trans, genderfluid, or gender non-conforming. It's not that I don't find aspects of gender/gendered expression attractive, it's just that genderbending/androgyny/gender vagueness can be just as if not more appealing to me as someone who is ""traditionally"" masculine or feminine presenting, in part because it rejects society's bullshit ideas of gender and feels so freeing to me, but also because it ""combines"" two traditional genders I find attractive and adds to it.

Does this make any sense? Does that mean I'm bi or pan? Or both? I'm probably bi, right?",pansexual

"Findings from study on bisexual and nonmonosexual women's discrimination, resilience, and mental health outcomes","Hello there!
A while ago, you may have seen a recruitment add related to bisexual and non-monosexual women‚Äôs experiences of discrimination, resilience, advocacy, and mental health outcomes. I want to thank all of you who took the time to respond to the questions, sharing your perspectives, and entrusting us as researchers. Our research team truly appreciates it! 

You may have found yourself curious about the findings of this study, so I'd like to share with you what we found. More specifically, this study examined the relations among multiple discriminatory experiences (anti-bisexual discrimination, sexism), LGBTQ+ and feminist advocacy, resilience, and psychological outcomes (distress and well-being). Results from the study found that both anti-bisexual and sexist discrimination were related to psychological distress, although LGBTQ+ and feminist advocacy and resilience were related to less psychological distress and greater well-being. In addition, resilience appeared to offset the harmful impact of sexism in relation to psychological distress. So, there's some good support for the importance of advocacy initiatives on one's own well-being (and just in terms of working to create a more just society), as well as developing resilience to aid in coping with discrimination. 

I know several folks provided feedback on this study, also suggesting that level of identity outness (including concealment and disclosure) may have made some of these experiences more or less common. Although we didn‚Äôt include this a variable in the study, we do believe it is an important area of additional research‚Äîas well as bisexual invisibility altogether‚Äîand have suggested it as an area of needed research in our manuscript that was accepted for publication. 

Again, thank you so much for your assistance!

Take good care all!

A Little About Being Pansexual,"I can only speak for myself and at least some for my fianc√© who is sitting next to me.

First of all, we don't really use labels -much - but I guess we're called cis m/f. I am in my mid 30s, which could explain my reluctance to use labels.

I know it's a clich√© but we love people - people of all types, looks, genitals, personalities, whatever. Here's an even bigger clich√©: we love people who love people. All true, though.

Be clear: I don't want to hook up with everyone I see. I'm not a dog. I'm attracted to everyone/anyone who is cool, down to earth, fun, etc. And like everyone else on earth, I'm more attracted to some people over others. *That's* *okay*. (Some people, whether man, woman, trans, whatever, are just so pretty and fun to be with. Some people aren't.)

The following sentences of this paragraph are going to be sexually graphic, I guess don't read them. My g spot is in my butthole. We are passionate in bed. We give up 100% of ourselves - head to toe - and we only get intimate with people who are the same way. We both love that physical connection with people.

On a slight side note, to anyone who might've read all this, don't ever let anyone take your preferences from you. It's not right and you won't be happy. Other people's approval, negativity, scorn, derision, words, etc. mean nothing in life. At the end of the night we have to be alone with ourselves. Be who you are meant to be.

In those small hours of the night, everyone else asleep, alone with my thoughts, I'm happy and content because I embrace who I am rather than run from it. I sleep soundly and deeply.

(But maybe these things have helped me in life:

I have an amazing partner who is the same way - we were made for each other; I'm the coolest, most loyal person you'll likely meet; I'm a 6' tall bear, after being at 140lbs throughout my twenties; and, quite frankly, I can take care of myself.)

Can I be Pansexual but not like female genitalia?,"Ok so here's the thing. I would consider myself pansexual, I like all genders, mainly trans women and men. But I also like women. I would like to have a girlfriend, but the problem is I'm not really sexually attracted to female genitalia. I think the female form is very attractive, it's just female genitals that are a turn off for me. I know sex and attraction is more than just genitals but it's pretty big part of it, it's kind of a dilemma for me since I would like to have a girlfriend but I know we would have to have sex eventually if it got serious, and it would be kind of a problem if I'm not even interested in the thought in putting my penis in her vagina, to put it bluntly haha.",pansexual

Help a married young woman label her sexuality?,"I grew up in a very close minded community and in religious cult, Since I was a teen ive found  myself attracted to heterosexual, gay and lesbian porn. When I was a young girl i experimented with a girl, and was told and taught that behavior was wrong.  After that I just experimented with boys, so I considered myself hetero with a girl curiosity. I felt attracted to certain type of men and women, usually their face, specially their smile and eyes.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago, I was dating my now husband - and I was at Whole Foods, and I walked up to the cashier and I met this absolutely gorgeous girl, she seem tomboyish, short hair blond, very pretty face, blue eyes and beautiful smile - and holy shit shit she made me weak to my knees. I felt exactly how I felt when I met my now-husband, just shy and couldn‚Äôt look at her face. I felt like I was going to embarrass myself in front of her. after that I found myself always going to what Whole Foods hoping to see her and hoping to strike up a conversation. I told my bf about this, and he didn‚Äôt seem very bothered by that, except for ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to watch you with another girl‚Äù comment - by that time I had quit that job that was close to that Whole Foods and never saw her again. I think about her once in a while. 

I‚Äôve also met transgender men who I‚Äôve found myself attracted to their smile and eyes too... idk. I may be rambling now lol anyhoo... 

About a year ago, I married my husband and idk why I‚Äôm more aware of my sexuality and who I am. I learned about the word pansexual, and Idk how to identify myself or if I should even care. Idk if a label will help try to settle this question in me. It‚Äôs not like I can date other people and see if I‚Äôm bi or pan.

At the beginning of this year I thought I was straight, then around May or so I thought I was bi, but now I've been thinking.

I think I just have a type and it transcends (if you'll pardon the pretentious word) a person's assigned gender/gender. I've found myself attracted to cis men, cis women, trans women, trans men, people whose gender I didn't know as it was none of my business to ask; you know the score.

The oddness of the Human Condition...,"So... How to start this post?

Maybe by just positing what I want to say up front and then explaining it would be best. Of special note though is to understand the difference between empathy and sympathy... If you don't know, go look it up because I don't wanna drag on too long in this probably divisive post.

I empathise with people who are paedophilia, paedaristic or zoophilic... Now I'm not one myself but I understand how that sentence looks.

So... Clarification is needed. I don't agree with those people who act on these feelings and honestly my opinion on anyone who abuses a child is that they should be afforded the worst punishment imaginable - chemical castration, locked in with more violent criminals, crippled in some way,  etc. What I'm trying to say is that the feelings aren't beholden to logic or reason and that people with these proclivities shouldn't be hated simply for what they are, but whether they act on it or not.

Stepping away from kids because I think every sane person on the planet agrees - sex or sexual activity without consent is one of the vilest acts a human being can commit and as I mentioned before there are those who are zoophiles instead.

Now Furries, I love Furries. I'm not one myself (I don't think...) but I like the ideal behind it. They love animals so much and understand that forcing that love onto a creature that can't give informed consent is wrong and so they dress up and role play with other people with the same given inclinations. At least most of them do, human nature being what it is there are always a few rotten bastards in any group no matter what their orientation. Even here in Australia there are a few documented peadarists who understanding that acting on their attractions would cause harm to that which they can't help but love isolate themselves.

Besides nowadays if they want to indulge in those feelings there's literally thousands, possibly millions of examples of literature or hentai out there for them to be lost in rather than corrupting an innocent loving being. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this. It's not that I want to advocate for awareness or rights for these people in particular, or that I want to stand in solidarity for them. I have no sympathy for the feelings or the plights of those who act on them after all. But, especially growing up in a town that was more likely to treat a 20-something going out with a high schooler as a upstanding member of society than a young queer kid struggling to make heads or tails of the attractions they felt to people, I empathise with the idea that you cannot control what you're attracted to and anybody that says otherwise is either delusional or a fucking moron.

Maybe I just had this swirling around in my head too long and wanted a forum where I could lay down the principle of my argument... That feelings can never be truly controlled, your attractions and inclinations towards a particular sex, gender or individual group cannot be changed and that everyone should aspire to consensual and understanding love.

Maybe I'm just an idiot who wanted to say something in a place where maybe someone else will understand my thinking or if not, tell me why they disagree without calling me a 'poncy little poofter cunt'...

Please feel free to let loose if you disagree vehemently, I understand it's not a particularly great point of view but hey, I've always been out of tune with humans anyway so I'd be interested to see the spectrum of arguments either against or (far less likely :3) for my points raised here.

Advice for pan SO,"Ok, this is my first post and I'm excited about the potential advice


Me and my SO have been together for two years. The past couple months, we starting fighting quite a bit, and I could tell something was off. This happened for a while. Fast forward, and I got him to go to a trans-rally with me (I'm a cisfemale) in support and education in general, and he was far for interested than I expected!

It was then kind of randomly through text that he came out to me as pan, very nonchalant, he interwebbed it in a conversation! Since then he seems much more relaxed, and just generally happier. He equated the next day to ""feeling like a breath of fresh air"". 

We both generally seem closer and happier since; I'm really thankful and proud that he's not only being true to himself, but for choosing to share it with me.

My question is, is there something you all would've appreciated as a ""coming out gift""? Something I could give or do that really shows him I love and support him? I don't want to seem like I'm harping on it, (which I tend to overdo things) and he seems to be nonchalant about it, but I think it's a big step and want to show him that I know it matters.

I'm a 21 year old male, I've always had a dislike for labels and avoided putting them on myself so I've personally kind of just sexually identified as.... human? horny? I don't know, I'm attracted to both cocks and vaginas. Romantically, I lean towards feminine and androgynous individuals (""traps"" as they're called online), but sexually I'm pretty much down for whatever as long as the attraction is there.

To people (and my female SO), I've identified heterosexual, or sometimes I'd say I'm bisexual to new friends, but I've avoided it a bit because people would be a bit surprised since apparently I don't look like the type of guy who'd be bisexual. It feels like I'm more attracted to the person. Sometimes that person was born a male but identifies as a female, sometimes they were born a male and identify male, sometimes they were born female and identify female, and so on.

I‚Äôm a very femme cis gender woman, and I‚Äôve only dated people that identify as men. I have settled down with a trans man who I love very much. I just feel like I have no place in the lgbt community and like I‚Äôm lying about being pan. I know who I am, and I know who I‚Äôm attracted to, but it feels wrong to identify as pan/queer since I‚Äôve only been with people who identify as men. ",pansexual

"So I all but ‚Äúcame out‚Äù to my mom, and it was kind of disappointing (LONG AF)","So first things first; I‚Äôm pansexual.

So basically me and my mom were talking about lgbtq stuff. It‚Äôs not uncommon because even when I thought I was straight I had a trans best friend (still is he‚Äôs amazing) I was a huge supporter of the lgbtq community and stuff. She‚Äôs in her 50‚Äôs and I believe she‚Äôs pretty accepting for that generation. We‚Äôve had numerous convos (because it‚Äôs in the news and she knows I know stuff so she asks questions or we talk about the stuff that‚Äôs going on) and here‚Äôs what she has said about gay people and coming out and such;

She‚Äôd be ok with her kids being gay (by extension pan or bi she just uses that as a blanket term).

She said she wouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed, so I asked her ‚Äúso if one of us were gay and had a s/o, you‚Äôd be like ‚Äòthis is my youngest Jess and their girlfriend ___?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúyes I‚Äôd introduce your partner‚Äù

But every time we talk about how other people reacted to their kids coming out she‚Äôd always say how she would react: ‚Äúthey chose a rough life. Two guys or two women walking down the street holding hands people are going to be rough. As much as society is different and more accepting than 30 years ago, its still rough‚Äù

I get what she‚Äôs saying but the wording she always says ‚Äúchose‚Äù. It bothers me. I know it‚Äôs her generation and that‚Äôs the way she thinks but it really makes me hesitate.

We brought up religion as well with this topic. She‚Äôs not overly religious, she believes in god but doesn‚Äôt go to church or says the rosary or whatever. I said there are people who are in the lgbtq that are still religious and their philosophy is that ‚Äúgod made them the way they are‚Äù just how religious straight people say about themselves ‚Äúwhat do you think?‚Äù. And she was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they do. And that‚Äôs good for them‚Äù And she said something over top of what I started saying so I didn‚Äôt hear it clearly but it gave the impression to me that she didn‚Äôt agree with them thinking that‚Äôs how god made them.

I‚Äôm not religious whatsoever but her response made me a little weary.

We also talked about how my grandparents would react to one of us coming out. They‚Äôre very religious Portuguese people. My grandma isn‚Äôt bad when gay people do come up in topic she‚Äôs like ‚Äúas long as they don‚Äôt force it on me or in my face we‚Äôre good‚Äù. So that gives me a little hope. We‚Äôre extremely close, so I don‚Äôt see her reacting horribly. My mom seems to think that if we‚Äôd (we because we were talking about any of her kids being gay) show her and explain to her that we‚Äôre happy and we are being safe she‚Äôd come around even more.

My grandpas a different story, he‚Äôs very quiet and only really speaks when he wants to. So I just imagine him not really saying anything on the subject if i did ‚Äúcome out‚Äù.

Obviously with the amount of convos we‚Äôve had but most importantly this one where we talked more in depth, she probably suspects. She‚Äôs not dumb.

But I‚Äôm hesitant to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù. Because of all this. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm nervous because of how I know she‚Äôd respond or because some people in this community see it as a big deal.

I hate the term ‚Äúcome out‚Äù. I always said I wouldn‚Äôt. My ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù would be ‚Äúhey Mom and Dad, meet my girlfriend ___‚Äù or if someone would ask me I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm pan‚Äù.

God that‚Äôs long af. If you have questions, I‚Äôll answer them.

(Sorry if the grammar or anything was horrible, I was typing fast to get all my thoughts out before I lost it. I know it was a big jumble of stuff so sorry for your brain!)

EDIT: I‚Äôm not ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù by her response anymore. After thinking about things and through the lovely people on this app, I‚Äôve gotten over what I thought was disappointing. Her use of ‚Äúchoose‚Äù really threw me off and made me think she doesn‚Äôt get it. After the conversations on here I  honestly from all of what she was saying I think she meant ‚Äúchoosing to show the world‚Äù rather than ‚Äúchoosing to be in the lgbt spectrum‚Äù. ",pansexual
Sex/Gender irrelevant to sexual attraction?,"I was wondering if anyone else who identified as pansexual found the sex/gender of the person irrelevant to sexual attraction? I'm not saying that a person's sex or gender is irrelevant as it is part of their identity and that is important, but just for sexual (or romantic?) attraction.

Personally I find people without very masculine or very feminine traits the most attractive, and this is irrelevant to their sex/gender. I was just wondering if anyone else felt the same or if some of y'all find people attractive dependent on their sex/gender.

Also personality is important to me. If someone is racist, sexist, homophobic, or has a hateful ideology I lose any attraction for them. I am also aromantic pansexual if that helps.",pansexual

Name that sexuality!,"I hope that title was thrilling enough for you, because this is another ""am I pansexual"" post.

So, I've always known my sexuality and gender identity was a little off, even since I was a kid. I'm a cis female, but I've always been on a boyish side and even when I was a child I would pretend I was ""half boy."" I'm a little more on the masculine side when it comes to my identity, I suppose.

I've only ever dated guys, and when I was I had a hard time being sexually attracted to them off the bat. Hookups went nowhere and were boring for me, and even then I'm a still virgin. I *have* been sexually attracted to men before, but *only* after I was really close to them and good friends with them. Furthermore, I have been in love with a guy. But even then, I didn't even really want to kiss a whole lot or do much sexually, and the sexual attraction faded even though my romantic feelings for him lasted for a while.

With girls, it's a different story. Girls have always been more pleasing to look at, and only recently have I accepted that I'm attracted to them. I haven't even kissed a girl yet - but I can look at one and can immediately imagine getting down and dirty with her, which is something I rarely did with guys. 

To go even further, I'm only thinking about this in boy- girl terms. I haven't even begun to address the pantheon of other gender-inbetweens.

I don't know. I know the ultimate answer is for me to get out there and just friggen do what comes naturally, but I really wanted to get this off my chest and receive some feedback. I pegged it at ""demisexual panromantic"" but who knows?

Tl;dr - is it possible to be demisexual with guys but sexually attracted to girls?",pansexual

I don't know how to deal with my mom,"I [25F] came out to my parents about 4 months ago after breaking up with my ex because he is gay. The first thing my mom said is ""how do you know?"" I asked ""how do you know you're straight?"" I really didn't want to get into how when I was 12 we went to a movie and there was a sex scene where I could not stop staring at this woman's breasts. All I thought about was how I wanted to lick them and finger her while I play with them. I remember feeling really uncomfortable and very weird but it passed and it was fine I figured everyone must think that that sometime. She then said, ""you're just a pan because [your ex] is gay."" She asked a couple more questions than my dad told her to shut up.

After being almost afraid of my dad for most of my childhood he's probably my best friend. He was totally born to raise young adults. I told me to do whatever just makes me happy and he would to glad to someday maybe meet my girlfriend. I also once accidentally texted him graphic details about how I like to have sex with strangers on the weekend. He texted my back ""thanks for the laugh. How do I delete this?"" He's pretty cool.


About 2 weeks ago I cut my hair really short, after having long hair my whole life, and the first thing my mom says to me is ""are you gay?"" I told her ""no I'm pansexual it's like bisexual but more inclusive."" It probably didn't help I was wearing my rainbow pride shirt but that was a coincidence and it's comfortable. She said ""lesbians have short hair.""

When I was in middle school I went through a really bad depression. I was cutting myself daily, I was either crying or running out of class, I would sneak away just to be in the basement alone. My parents made me go to 4 different therapists in 2 years because therapists and Jesus fix everything. I didn't speak to any of them. My mom said ""why did we keep taking you it was a waste of money"" I told them I didn't want to go and I wasn't talking. As an adult I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 1, OCD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I'm still on their insurance so they pay my medical bills and my mom complains about the cost. She doesn't even pay them my dad does. I have a new therapist as an adult and she said I don't have to do anything I don't want to so I stopped going to therapy. My mom said she doesn't like her but frankly I don't give a flying fuck. I'm finally just doing what I want. My mom used to yell at me when I would get anxious in public. We went to a movie once and my mom asked me to get popcorn. I saw someone I went to school with and I was so embarrassed to been seen with my parents I just shut down. My mom yelled at me in the middle of the concession stand and just rolled her eyes. Another time my dad was running to the store to get something and I forgot to tell him something I needed. I heard his car start up and my mom ran outside to tell him. I told her it's fine I'll just text it. She just yelled at me ""sometimes you need to talk to people even if it is your father.""

She kept bringing all this up even though I told her I didn't want to talk about it. She said ""well now your behavior in middle school makes sense. You were confused."" She kept saying how it was so horrible for her like I bring her dishonor or something. Then she's asking for really personal details of my sex life. We don't talk about sex at all in my family. So I kept getting confused when she kept asking ""were you WITH someone?"" She keeps asking me how two woman would have sex and I just say you do what straight people do, whatever you want. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I'm not just going to cut my mom out of my life but I don't know how to make her just stop asking so many inappropriate questions I'm not comfortable answering. She also told me to go to church when she's knows I've been an atheist for at least the past decade. Jesus and therapy fix everything and I'm doing neither so she's really confused. ",pansexual

"""Not gay enough?""","As a pansexual person, have you ever been told you're not gay enough to be part of the queer community?

For some background, I'm pansexual and polyamorous. 
I have lived with my long-term boyfriend for almost 8 years, but we both date other people. We've both had a few other serious relationships and one of my girlfriends  (now ex) lived with us for a bit. 

I haven't really talked about my sexuality a lot in the past, but I've always known I wasn't straight. Even as a child, my romantic interests didn't discriminate when it came to gender. 
I've always really known who I was in that way, even if I didn't always have a name for it. 

The first time someone told me I wasn't really queer was earlier this year when I was at an anime convention with my ftm boyfriend (now ex because he turned out to be trash), and a friend was there with her girlfriend. The friend made a comment about how weird it was hanging out with straight people. I replied with something along the lines of ""there are straight people here?!"" Sort of faux horror. 
And she responsed by saying that I'm straight. And I was like ""no?"" 
She also identifies as pansexual, so this caught me off guard. We've had conversations about our sexuality before, while I was dating a woman, and she didn't bring up me being straight. 

Since then, there have been other weird, offhand comments I've gotten from others in the community about how bi and pan people aren't actually queer unless we are in same sex relationships. 

Today, at pride, I got to talking to a woman who commented on my eyeshadow, which was rainbow and looked awesome. I move my hands a lot when I talk and at one point she saw the bracelets I was wearing. Three on each wrist, to represent the pansexual flag. 
And she asked me why I was at gay pride. And I said I wanted to get more involved in the community. I had not been to Pride since I moved to this city. And she told me that I don't belong there. That pansexual isn't a valid sexuality and I'm just making things harder for people who are actually gay.

I was already emotionally stressed by other things going on and I started crying. She walked away and I went home. 

The more I hear these things, especially from the queer community, the more it upsets me. 
My sexuality IS valid!

"I, a cisgender/""straight"" female, am deeply in love with a trans woman.","I'm going to try to make this as coherent and short as possible, but please be patient with me. There is a lot going on in my head and heart right now.

I was going to post this on r/asktransgender, but I am all here for her gender identity and this is mainly about my own sexual identity being called into question. I fell in love with a person in a man's body. We're just friends at this point, but I've never had feelings like this for anybody. I was with my ex for almost seven years and we have a child together. I thought I loved him. I know now I did not. I never really did.

So, within the last two years, I've become friends with and, slowly but surely, developed earth-quakingly deep feelings for the most kind, good-hearted, intelligent, sensitive, loyal, hard-working, funny person I've ever met. 

They very recently revealed that they identify as a woman. I was the first person she's ever told.

It surprises me how much it doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm so ridiculously proud of her for coming out to me that I get teary-eyed just thinking of it.

This woman lights up a room when she's happy. Her joy is infectious. She radiates. I've never met anyone like her. God, this woman. I want absolutely nothing else but to be able to put a smile on her lovely face and I'd gladly spend my life trying to do just that. I've had this sneaking suspicion that we're going to get married one day for a while now and I never really even wanted to get married before.

These are serious and pretty scary feelings considering that her transition is in its infancy. As is our relationship, in many ways. I trust her with such totality, though. Always have. If she were a man, I would have probably run away or self-destructed by now. But, I haven't. I feel like it's one of those rare instances that waiting is actually worth it.

All of this and I'm supposedly straight.

Thing is, her coming out to me has made me reopen that little door with that little nagging voice that always whispered, ""well, I dunno...""

Truthfully, I was always attracted to women. When I  started masturbating, it was to pictures of women. I remember getting little jolts of confusing excitement when I'd help one my friends climb up something and my hands would brush against her legs. But, I was always attracted to boys, too. I liked them both. My early sexual experiences were divided equally between boys and girls. 

I kissed them both. Their body parts didn't make that much of a difference to me.

As I got older, the shame set in. I was taught that gay people were okay and straight people were okay, but bisexuality was not. Bisexuality was just an excuse to cheat on your significant other. It was impossible to like both. You had to pick a side.

I ""chose"" to be straight because I'm not a lesbian.

I'm not straight, though. I avoid looking at girls and trans men I find attractive out of the lingering shame I feel when not completely conforming to the ""pretty straight girl"" identity that I was told was the only option. 

So closeted that I couldn't even allow myself to look at a man just because he was born in a woman's body just in case that might not be ""straight"" enough.

I can't believe I'm saying all of this.

But, it's true. It's all so true.

I've always been very accepting of others' sexuality and gender. I would never think of other people the way I've thought about myself. Why have I been hiding for so long?

There's so much more, but I'll spare you all for now.

How do I tell people that I'm pansexual?Should I tell the woman I'm in love with? How? When?

Should I post this on r/asktransgender? 

She has so much going on inside of her, I'd hate to add to that weight. Plus, it's pretty terrifying simply because it would expose every ounce of my feelings for her. We've told one another that we love each other and it's been very intimate. But, I'm still scared. So much could go wrong. Nothing is official. There are still obstacles.

I'm scared, but feel like THIS is the most ""correct"" thing I've ever felt.

Thank you all so much for reading. I feel really weird, but really good.

Do pansexuals feel attraction towards genderqueer gynesexuals?,"Greetings, I'm a 32-old genderqueer from Chile and, ever since I accepted my true self, I've been wondering what kind of cis-woman would feel attracted to someone like me. I was born male yet never fully identified as such, I don't hate my masculine parts, but other than enjoying sex and peeing standing up, having them wasn't a big deal for me. 

Masculinity has always been alien to me, there was a time not so long ago that I tried to appear more manly and the result wasn't satisfying. Women found me attractive, but not enough to fall for me. A month ago I realized I was living unauthentically and embraced the fact that I'm much more feminine than masculine, even if physically I don't look one way or the other.

Questioning Sexuality Endlessly,"**tl;dr i question my sexuality with fear of not being straight, and end up talking about extreme taboo and maniacal kinks**

I declared to myself that I felt pansexual about 1.5 years ago, I'm 20, and I still feel confused very very often. I'm just going to dump what's been going on in my head and hope to hear some opinions or similar experiences. A lot of this has to do with pansexuality, but also fantasy kinks and stuff like that.

Bit of background, I've only dated women, who were mostly cis, except one much longer term relationship with someone who also identified as pansexual, but still passionately female. That's not to say they didn't play dominating roles or things like that in their gender role. I've had a pretty straight life, except a few consecutive occasions when I was in high school where I gave/received a handjob and received a blowjob from a close friend that was male identifying and gay. 

I was a lot younger when that happened, and was conditioned by society to feel wrong about it. I think I just wasn't comfortable with the idea. Possibly from parenting, possibly from myself, who knows, I still don't know. We hooked up a few times, but never kissed on the lips or anything like that. I ended up getting up and leaving one time he was coming onto me because I think I just genuinely didn't like how it felt at the time, and that was the end of that.

In terms of internet porn, which I'm particularly curious to whether you guys think is valid or even meaningful, I transitioned from watching straight porn to watching gay porn to watching porn with transgender women, and bouncing back and forth between them. As a clueless teen, I just feared about being gay, for some reason, and lived in fear of not being straight. After freshmen year of college, it became pretty clear to me I don't really fit the typical male gender role. I identified with a lot of feminine mannerisms, but also didn't feel entirely like I wanted to give up all my male characteristics, and still don't honestly. I labeled myself as gender queer, which was actually a really common and well received thing at the college I was going to, and felt a little bit better. I still identify as gender queer, but struggle all the time, *still*, about thinking about my sexuality.

What it comes down to in my head, is I think I am more sexually aroused by dicks than vaginas, but far far far far far far *far* more emotionally attracted and connected to women or female identifying individuals than men. This basically leads me to transgender women, but for some reason I never feel comfortable with that result. The hard part is I can't differentiate if it's due to fears of society/parents or I just genuinely still like women too. There's something that's frightening to me about only dating one person of one identifying gender for the rest of my life until I die, which I know is where polygamous relationships come into play, but I don't know much about them and feel like they're commonly looked down upon or seen as alien in every social circle I've ever been in. I usually end up thinking in my head that I'm just more sexually attracted to transgender women than regular women, but not more emotionally connected to one or the other. This obviously leads to conflicts in my head though, because should I just pursue trans women then? I am currently, though, pursuing women like crazy because I genuinely just don't know any transgender women, and I am **very** selective and put huge emphasis on emotional connection rather than sexual encounters. It's easy to feel like I could be in heaven just dating some girl where the sex is good, but I could never bring myself to do it. This paragraph is pretty much where I would like to hear any insights or similar experiences about.

Now, on a different topic, which I think is more related to mental illness, sometimes when I masturbate I sometimes think I am incredibly stimulated by taboo. Taboo is a pretty broad word, but it basically materializes into negative taboo things. Being dominant and misogynistic towards someone female-identifying, being completely dominated/gangbanged by wealthy powerful men, cheating with sex, being abused, and some other even scarier ones, are all things that I have one or another ended up masturbating to. Obviously they all remain as fantasies, but now, typing this out, it scares me a lot more. I guess I can gain comfort knowing it's in my head, but I feel like it can all sound very psychopathic very fast. It's just the idea that it's *wrong* that arouses me immensely. To the point where sometimes if I'm not really feeling it when I'm having sex with some random hookup, I'll think about us having sex with context of something that's inherently wrong (I've thought about incest and rape before..) and I'll be able to cum way faster. This post started really as a curious questioning thing with my sexuality, but it's turned into a completely different topic. I feel like as I'm writing this out and getting it out of my brain for the first time to other people, I'm scared. Usually I think about these things in the heat of the moment, and then cum, and then forget about them and don't think about things like that ever again. I feel like this is very unhealthy and I want help. I've been to a therapist before, but just for depression and anxiety, not really directly relating to any of this. It obviously complicates things with my sexuality, because in terms of thinking about my best friend fucking me and demeaning me vividly in my head (because that's taboo and wrong), makes me immediately feel like I'm gay. But when I'm not incredibly horny and alone masturbating, I don't think about ever starting a relationship with my friend or even having sex with him, it's just the extreme taboo and inherently erroneous act that's so hot. I do find myself masturbating to traps or transgender women more so than any other porn as of the past year or so, which might lead me towards the direction of thinking I'm just attracted to trans women, but perhaps it's because it's something that would be seen as ""wrong"" by society and why it's arousing to me.",pansexual

Is pansexual the right term?,"I've been doing a lot of thinking about my sexuality lately and I realized I'm basically only attracted to men who are more feminine than masculine and women who are more masculine than feminine, as well as many androgynous and non-binary people.

"I've been out as a Lesbian for years. I'm realising I'm probably pan, but if I admit that my sister will think that she's 'cured' me.","Yeah :(

Tragic backstory; mum is one of the sweet christians who genuinely cares about everyone, but she's dying of cancer and the main thing that is helping her get through it is knowing that she will see us all in heaven. My sister, however, is a particularly hateful baptist christian who uses the 'hate the sin, not the sinner' excuse for her abhorrent behavior toward LGBT people. A few years ago she literally tried to disown me because I refused to apologise for being angry at her when she told me I was a dirty sinner and going to hell for my 'wrong behaviour'.

The only reason I haven't 'come out' as agnostic is because I know my mum would be BEYOND devastated, and that my sister will use it as further cannon fodder and end up hurting my mum even more. I stay civil/friendly toward my sister and put up with her behaviour until she says something totally out of line for the same reason. I keep up a strict 'grey rock' approach around her. 

My sister is training to be a minister and she's got work in her church, where she is campaigning to be a helping hand to people struggling with mental illness. Of course, for her church that category includes LGBT people. I know she has been using me lately as an example for how she's really super tolerant and she can get along with gay people. I'm 100% aware of her trying to manipulate me into going back to church and she seems to think that my total lack of response is me accepting it. She is a BIG believer in ex-gay therapy so I'm just waiting for the day that she signs me up for it. 

So my present predicament is; I'm starting to think I'm more pansexual. Most of my crushes (Like 95%) are on ciswomen, but they are all either in a relationship or straight and I'm happy on my own so I just push it out of my mind. But I've been interested in non-binary/trans people before, and this time I am kinda interested in a guy I met who happens to be single. I'm starting to realise I'm attracted to personality first - it just happens that most of the time women fit my 'type'. I want to explore relationships with anybody I'm interested in, no matter what gender they are. I'm interested in trying out dating this guy just to see how it goes. 

But... my sister has been not-so-subtly trying to convert me and I know if I start a relationship with a cishet guy she will be over the moon and use me as an example for how ex-gay therapy works, no matter what I say otherwise. Since she's in a position of power in her church, has an inherent hatred of queer people, and has been focusing on providing 'help' to people like me, letting her think that would be so so dangerous to anybody she ends up 'counselling'. So I'm feeling kinda stuck and resentful about it. I live with her and my mum so it's not like I can totally hide it from her or cut her off. Until mum passes away I refuse to leave her alone with my sister, so I'm stuck here. 

I don't know what to do. ",pansexual

My little sister told me she's pansexual,"She's 14 and I'm her 19 year old brother. We're on vacation and are sleeping in the same room. We went to bed around 11:00 last night and stayed up until nearly 1:00 just talking. She was asking me random questions as well as personal questions, like relationship type stuff, and I tried to answer everything the best I could. She was asking me about my girlfriends I've had and she told me about her boyfriends and her first kisses. I'm usually pretty soft-spoken and this was the first time I talked with her about personal stuff like that. I was a little uncomfortable but I could tell she was really enjoying the talk. I mostly just listened.

When she told me she's pansexual I was just sort of like ""oh, okay"". She said she's into boys, girls, and everything in between. I asked her ""What's in between boys and girls?"". She just sort of started saying a list of words that I had never heard before. I think demi and omni were in there. I still haven't looked any of them up.
I told her I didn't really believe in gender fluidity or the whole idea of the gender spectrum. She seemed surprised but we didn't really get into it, we went to sleep shortly after.

My concern is this. She is still very young and I'm worried she's feeling compelled to apply labels to herself. She's a very sweet and thoughtful person, but I'm having trouble believing that she's emotionally mature enough to come to this sort of conclusion. I'm worried that social pressure might be playing too big a role in how she conceptualizes herself, but I also don't want to impose my beliefs on her. I also don't want to belittle her by saying something like ""it's just a phase"" even though I genuinely think it might be.

Edit:  Hey everyone, thanks for all your replies! I've read them all. This is all pretty new to me so sorry if I was insensitive, that wasn't my intention. And even though some of you got a little passive aggressive I feel like I've got some new insight, so thank you. Like most of you suggested, it's probably best I just let her figure it out herself. She's already pretty comfortable talking to me, and I'll always try to be there for her. Even when we disagree it never turns angry for either of us. It's a weird dynamic for sure, one that I'm not used to. I never really had someone to open up to like that growing up, but that was probably my own fault for being so closed off, so I'm very excited to be that person for my little sister.",pansexual

Haha I am confused,"Sorry if this goes against any rules, I'd just like to sort of rant. Sorry about my English too.
When I was quite young, I found myself being sexually turned on by the female body (I think it started when I was maybe 6 or 7. I never knew about sex.) Around this age plus a few years later, I don't think I ever found sexual arousal from the male body.
But I get emotionally attached to males. Recently I realized I can get emotionally attached to females or just anybody, so I'm guessing that's pansexual, but probably not since it's not sexual attraction I'm talking about. But when I get emotionally attached to females, it feels more like I'm forcing myself and really I may just want them as a close friend- unlike a guy where I think of them in a more romantic sense. It's weird. 

I thought I never really found males sexually attractive, but then I've fantasized more about enjoying sex with a male than a female and recently I realized that I like yaoi, so now I'm just confused lmao. I don't really feel anything when I think of lesbian sex however. It's possible I've grown out of being sexually attracted to females since maybe that was all I had known of sexuality when I was younger. I like the idea of dressing like a guy and being mistaken for one/treated as one with the pronouns and such, but I'm not transexual and I label myself as tomboy (so like, cross dressing I guess?) 

Plus, I have schediaphilia/fictophilia (mostly emotionally to males, but sometimes female sexually and occasionally female emotionally even though it might just be me wanting some sort of friendship?) Lmao I'm just really confused XD. To clarify, I am female. I guess I want some label to explain my orientation better/simplify everything but people say labels aren't necessary when it starts getting complicated so I might just get advice such as, ""you are whoever you are you don't need a label!"" I know that isn't bad advice, but it'll be kind of relieving if I can just use one word to describe myself lmao.

I am really sorry if that was confusing, it was a bit of a rant so I'll try to clarify if there are any questions/misunderstandings",pansexual
Confused about my sexual orientation...,"Recently I read a book where the female main character had to pretend she was a boy. While she was masquerading as a male, she met a girl and they danced together and kissed. Later this girl found out the main character was female and she wasn't weird about the discovery or anything, but said that she wasn't interested in the main character anymore because she wasn't into girls. (Sorry if I lost you there.)

I remember this surprising me, it just felt so inherently wrong. It startled me that she was no longer interested in someone simply because of their sex. That felt wrong, that felt weird to me.

I know a simple scene in a book is such a small, inconsequential thing, but ever since reading it I've been confused about my sexuality. I've never really thought love had a gender. If I was attracted to someone and their gender turned out to be different from what I'd initially thought I wouldn't think it'd change how I felt about them? Though, before this book I hadn't really given that circumstance much though, it just was what I'd assumed everyone was like, I didn't think that people would just automatically be not attracted to someone because on their gender?

I've only had one full-blown crush in my life, and it was a male, so I can't really look to that to determine whether I'm truly pansexual or not? I think I've been attracted to females but I'm not certain on anything really???

I know a simple paragraph in a book is pretty much nothing to go off of when discovering one's sexuality. I think I'm pan, but everyone seems so sure, and I'm not? I don't want to say or think I'm pan if I'm not, that'd be unfair to the community. I just don't know...

Need advice,"Hello, 

So I'm kind of new to Reddit so please forgive me for the wordy text or if I say something stupid.

I discovered I was pansexual about 4 years ago when I started falling for a friend of mine who is gender fluid. It was kind of confusing at first because I didn't know if it was the girl side of them that I liked or if it was the male side, until finally it dawned on me that it didn't matter. Anyways, she was into me as well so we tried dating for a bit. It didn't last very long and I didn't get very far, apart from kissing and touching. Fast forward almost 3 years later and I decide I want to try dating women again. I tried online dating and found this amazing woman. We had our first date and it was electric. I knew I had found my soul mate. The difference this time is that she's transgender (MtF). Now that didn't matter to me and it still doesn't. I love her for her amazing spirit and personality, not what's between her legs. This is where it starts getting difficult though. I met her before full time transition and before surgery. Every aspect of our relationship has been great, up until now. Our sex life has become stagnant. We are both very submissive people and to make matters more difficult, her gender dysphoria is starting to affect what we can and cannot do. She thinks getting surgery will fix most of those problems, especially those we currently have in the bedroom. I know having the surgery won't affect how much I care for her, but my biggest worry is that because I've never truly experienced having sex with a woman I'm not going to be able to please her anymore. 

Again, sorry for the wordy text. Any ideas or advice would be great. Thanks :).",pansexual

I'm male and afraid if I fall for a guy I'll get bored easily or start to miss the female body. Anyone else or vice-versa?,"So... I'm worried if I start a relationship, even if it's cute, casual, cuddly, and makes my life sparkle, that I'll get bored with the guys anatomy.

"""But you are so relaxed about it?!"" Reactions to Pan","After chatting about sexualities with some new found friends I explained that I identified myself as Bi.  My perception has always been that I love the person and appreciate the body and being very body positive you have to work (or not as the case may be) for me not to like your physical form.  After some questions one of them exclaimed ""then you are Pan like me!""  I laughed and calmly said ""probably we didn't have that term when I first discovered myself"".  

She was so pleased to meet another Pan that we chatted very candidly for about an hour.  A quieter member of the group looked like he wanted to say something about it all and after a while I said so and invited him to comment.  

He stumbled over the words but the upshot of it was ""but you are so relaxed about it?!"" and then went on to explain that only lgbtq+ people he met jump down his throat every time he ventured an opinion or asked a question.  Worse still they saw any questions or curiosity on his part as him trying to come out of the closet rather than being what we saw.  A respectful and curious cis straight guy wanting to not be ignorant.

We chatted for even longer talking about the thought processes that led me and my new Pan buddy Katie to realising ourselves.  He was transfixed by it all that he was able to share what was to him and interesting and different path through life no different to visiting another country and learning about another culture.

Part of being Pan for me is treating each new soul I meet as a new canvas until the colours show themselves.  We harm ourselves sometimes by so quickly painting the agendas of others before we know them and then acting so affronted when it happens to us.

"Advice, support and some possible clarity about my sexuality please.","I have always considered myself a straight female. Im happy being female but recently I have been questioning my sexuality. This is where it gets confusing.
I am now starting to realise I am not sexually attracted to people unless I like them as a person first. This I believe has always been true, as a young kid people would ask me who my crush was and I would say no one, as I genuinely didn't like any of the boys OR girls because I didn't know them well enough.
I have carried that into my young adult years. I do not have celebrity crushes, I do not find strangers in the street sexually attractive. I know a beautiful person when I see one, but I am not sexually attracted to them. I am only sexually attracted to a person after I love them for their personality. Due to this I am still virgin and have never had a partner as I am so picky with personalities. This would make me (from my own research Demi-sexual)
Until recently I have only ever had sexual attractions to men. This is were it gets confusing. I recently found out a girl who was friends with the man I was interested in was lesbian. I always thought she was beautiful, but I was not sexually attracted to her. But when I found out she was lesbian I was excited and cant stop thinking about her and how I would love to meet her (I'm assuming this is because I want to find out about her peronality.) I then went to a party and had an incredibly deep and meaningful conversation with another female in which people believe is in someway a part of the LGBT+ community. She was on MDMA and I was drunk (putting this in there because it may have had an affect on our feelings) We talked about our passions which were incredibly similar, she was kind, and I really liked her personality (always have, the conversation at the party just pushed me to like her more). We locked eyes at the party as she said to me ""you really are a truly beautiful woman' and I felt so much passion between us both, to the point where if id stayed a little longer I may have ended up asking her on a date. Both of these encounters with women have happened this year, so thats why its all so much more confusing. I have never been one to consider gender at all in any cases, I see souls instead (whether your a Trans Woman or Male, Female or Male, I see your soul) ((which through my own research is considered Pansexual?))
I will admit to questioning my sexuality a few times briefly in the past, as i do consider womens bodies to be beautiful and mens bodies too, but brushing the concept off immediately.
Im not sure I could imagine myself having sex with a woman, but I could imagine myself being in some sort of a relationship with a woman. But that also goes for a man as well, although when I love a man enough, I do want to have sex with him, so perhaps this is the case with women too if I were to love their personalities enough?
Adding to the stress is the fact that Im still virgin, so I'm scared I may loose my virginity to the wrong person as I'm so confused, and Im too scared to sleep with anyone to see wether Im sexually attracted to their gender on a whim because of my inability to feel sexually attracted without some form of relationship first.
Im unsure what I want out of this, but I just wanted some support and possibly some insight into where I may fit in. The rebellious, free spirited part of me (which is most of me) wants to say ""I'm whatever the fuck I am and love is love, I have no labels, I see no genders"" and to just go with the flow, which is truly, deeply in my heart what I believe, but the part of me which is still conformed to society thinks I need a label for it.
I feel i probably fit into some demi-sexual pansexual sub-category, but Im really not sure and don't really want the label. If you've read all of this Im truly greatful. I just need some help or support or something. Im so confused and am not comfortable yet bringing it up with my friends or family.

I need some support!,"Hello r/pansexual! I'm fairly new to this, so excuse me if I seem really wordy, but I want to get my thoughts out.
To be short and honest, I have realized that I am pansexual and am romantically attracted to all genders and orientations. I've been out for about a month and a half, but I find my confidence wavering in coming out to those lose to me. I've come out to most of my family and they've been entirely loving and supportive.
I guess I have two questions that I'd like to ask to now if any of you have advice or experienced similar things.
1) Next week, my class will be discussing sexual ethics, gender, and orientation. If sexual orientation comes up n the discussion and I am asked about my experience, I want to be honest about my orientation. I'm scared of how my colleagues will react because they've only known me as straight. How should I go about this?
2) I have been a Christian and active member of the United Methodist Church my whole life. It is still and will continue to be an important part of my life. But I am concerned about my relationship with my home church if I come out publicly (on Facebook, etc.) and if I potentially date and marry another man. Have any of you experienced this same dilemma?

My journey to accepting my orientation,"I was attracted to people regardless of sex and gender as long as I remember finding people attractive. I knew as a child that there was gay and straight, but I didn't know there was anything else. I tended to like males more in elementary school, so I thought of myself as straight, but I knew I liked females, so I was afraid I was possibly gay. I would cry and pray, asking for god to make me not like girls anymore. When that didn't work, I would be left feeling guilty about something that I had no control over. 

In junior high (that's what we called it in the early 2000's in SoCal), I heard about bisexuality and I knew that fit me better than heterosexual, but I had a hard time admitting it to myself. I had a crush on one of my female friends and we had frequent sleep overs. We would do flirtatious things, but never anything overtly sexual.

In the eighth grade, our class had a vote for the yearbook on things like ""most fashionable"", or ""most likely to succeed"". One guy who was supposed to be my friend convinced most of the class to vote for me and the girl who I liked as cutest couple. Since it was a private Christian school, they wouldn't publish those results, but students counted the votes, so everyone knew. 

I went to a high school kind of far away, so very few people from junior high ended up going to the same school. I was excited to have a new start. It was a performing arts school, so sexual orientation wasn't a big deal to students. I still went to a very conservative church and was very involved, so I still was hiding my orientation. 

I had so many crushes on girls at my school, but was too scared to act on them. In my junior year, I had two major crushes on two of my friends. The three of us were very close and I wanted to be with both of them. One time one of them told me that she found an actress attractive and that she might be bisexual. I wanted to kiss her, tell her she was beautiful, tell her I wanted to be with her, and that I loved her. I didn't because I was too scared. 

In my senior year, I had an openly bisexual friend in my weight lifting class and our lockers were close to each other. Sometimes I would wear sexy lingerie to get her attention. She often challenged me on my ""Christian"" beliefs and I knew I was a hypocrite because my church would teach homosexuality was wrong and I was attracted to women. One time she said that I could touch her nipple piercings, I wanted to, but I pretended I didn't.

In highschool, I am not sure when exactly, my friend from junior high invited me over for a sleepover. When we were going to bed she asked me if I ever thought about doing things with another girl. I knew if I said yes, we would end up doing things, but I was afraid so I said no. She said, ""Me either,"" and rolled over and went to bed. Sometimes I think about how alone that must have made her feel. 

In college, I was still telling people I was straight. My friends would joke that I was the most lesbian non-lesbian there was. Sometimes I would make out with other females, but I would only date men. People would ask me if I was bisexual all the time, but I would deny it. 

I got married to my wife and she was the the first person I told I was bisexual. (My wife is transgender, so I thought she was a man at the time.) Later I heard about pansexuality and realized that was more fitting for me. I slowly started falling away from Christianity and stopped praying to be straight.  I came to accept my orientation and stopped feeling guilty  about it. A little over a year ago I came out to all my friends and family. It went well overall, although a few people were mad I didn't tell them first or at how I came out. ",pansexual
My Definition of Pansexual,"I also posted this in a bisexual forum but I think it applies here. I'm super new to Reddit so I'm still learning.

Can't I just be sexual? I just don't really define myself as a specific sexuality. I'm a cis woman. I'm married to a man. He's the one my soul fell in love with. The physical attractions for me come only after my mind and heart fall in love. I'm physically attracted to anyone really. Yes, I do have just physical attractions to men and women. As in crushes or that tingle in my pants when I see Kit Harrington, Ruby Rose or Andrew Lincoln.

Though I've been attracted to transgender or gender fluid  folks too. I like androgynous people. I legit don't care what's between someone's legs. I'll like it if I like the person. And it doesn't have to ""match"" the gender. And just because I married a man doesn't mean I chose a sexuality. I chose HIM. I never know how to explain this..... I'm not straight because I married a man. It doesn't work like that. So hard to explain. Does anyone understand this? Myself? Like I said cis woman and femme (I don't even really know what femme means). Traditionally feminine? ",pansexual
I need some advice guys,"Recently I was really depressed and I wasn't quite able to put the finger on the why. I know how it is to hate oneself and I knew that it wasn't something like that this time. To my point: I in the last few week I encountered some different sexualities in literature and I thought a lot about those kind of things, and I was confused when I came to the conclusion that I really didn't care for the physical gender of the caracter. I know this is fiction and to compare it with reality doesn't really make much sense, but it really got me thinking.
I am a born male and also feel that way and I had some relationships with women. However, even though I like women sexually, I think I wouldn't really care about the actual sex of a romantic partner tbh.
In conclusion, I think, for me relationships, even sexually, would be possible for me under the right circumstances, but I am not quite sure, because I have no experience with other genders than female at all.
My questions:
-Given my feelings would be the way I assume, would this classify as pangender?
-How should I test whether I feel that way or not?
-Do you have general advice for my sorry ass xD
Thank you a lot if you are actually reading this. Wiriting this seems to help me not being depressed and think this unresolved problem could have actually been the cause.

I did it.,"Yeah, I'm the person who never wanted to come out to my parents. My mother sits me down one day after school, asks me about my day, what homework I have, etc. She then asks me (for about the thousandth time) about why I joined my school's Gay-Straight Alliance. I said it was because my friends wanted me to, and I also have several friends who were part of the community. Unfortunately, I had so many opportunities to tell both my parents I was pan, but decided to keep it to myself. But it was when my mother told me she kept hearing all this ""pan stuff,"" that I just had to tell her. It was also wasn't that easy answering ""yes"" to if I liked people of my own gender. To be honest, I think it was a bit anticlimactic. She told me she would always love me, we hugged. But I don't think it needed to be dramatic. I overheard her talking to my father, both whispering to each other, but I knew she just told him. He never confronted me about it, never spoke of it, he's just carrying on with his life. And that's okay! I was so scared of coming out, but now I feel proud. I feel relieved. 
I feel PANTASTIC.

If I were to take one thing away from this experience, it would probably be to tell them myself, rather than to get it out of me (which both my mother and sister have done). But again, that is quite alright with me! I'm glad my mother came to me first, because I know I still do NOT have the courage to speak up about it. So in the occasion of contradicting myself, I'm not so sure how I feel about my family knowing. They act like nothing ever happened, but I still come up with all these dumb scenarios of how they could be hiding a hint of wishing I was straight. But I am still glad I came out. So glad.

I need advice. I'm coming out.,"Hey, so I‚Äôm going to give a basic rundown here, for better setup, and so that you can understand my situation better. I'm a guy. A paper white, skinny, tall, male. I‚Äôm 14. I‚Äôm in 7th grade (I started late and have a summer birthday). The school I‚Äôm going to is a catholic school. It‚Äôs not so bad. Very accepting. I am an atheist. This isn't what I'm coming out about, but it is kind of important for you to know so that you understand that I'm not at risk of being disowned or hated because of who I am. I'm an atheist and it's not a secret, my parents know it, my friends and peers know it, my teachers know it, hell even the principle knows it. None of them really care. They truly couldn't give a damn, it's just ""whatever"" to them. And this is just how accepting everyone is. My parents are liberal, and as such I knew that they wouldn't be upset. I had thought that my new religious school and classmates would be, but they didn't care, like I said. The teachers, while some of them disagree with it and have their own beliefs as to my judgment, I'm sure, are not persecuting to me about it and don't try to make me repent or feel bad. My friends, don't believe that I will be punished or anything like that. While they are religious, they aren't archaic about it, and most don't even believe in hell. Now, I'm also openly ""not straight"". I'm pansexual. I like everyone. But as far as my friends are concerned I'm just not straight or am just bi. I've asked out 2 girls before (failed both times), and don't try and hide my interest for any of the sexy guys the girls swoon over. I've only ever said that I didn't just like girls. I haven't really told them the label for it, but it doesn't matter. Everyone knows that I'm pansexual, no one really cares, I don't care, it's all great. Except for one issue. Well, more like two actually. My parents. They don't know. I've jsut never really felt up for telling them. I once hinted at it when saying that this would be the year of school in which I'd actually consider dating and going out with someone. I kept it purposefully vague as to the gender. I didn't say I was going to ask girls out or have a boyfriend. They both asked me about that and both said that they loved me and wouldn't mind. I said the same thing to both of them, that with all do respect, it wasn't necessarily their business. And they accepted it and that was it. This was of course before I'd come out about being pansexual to everyone, and still felt a bit timid about people knowing. Okay, I have to make a quick pause. I have a plan. I am coming out. And I'm doing it in a way that I'm proud of and think will work best for me. So I've been writing/drawing these pages with pictures/words on them. It's kind of supposed to be a 'parody' of a kids book, meaning that it kind of has that feel to it, where there's a large picture on every page illustrating the story. In this little book, is my coming out confession. It talks about alot of things. And in the end comes out about the three things I need to come out about. One is the pansexuality and to my parents. The other two I'll talk about after this little pause. I think that this way of coming out will work best for me because I'm a great writer. I talk best through written words than spoken. And this is a way that I can enjoy. Basically, my depression (yeah I have it, it sucks, but that's not what this is about) took away my passion for drawing years ago. And only recently am I getting it back. So the two things I love to do, writing and drawing, are helping me come out. I don't want this to be something I hate. I'm going to come out through words and color. Anyway that's all, quick pause over. The main thing that I'm coming out about, is something I've only told three people. I'm genderfluid. And it really sucks ass. Atleast if your trans, you can try and transition, and then it's all fixed. For me, whether or not I feel like a guy or girl, isn't some stagnant thing. It changes. And it fucking sucks so god damn much. If I could have one wish, that had to be focused solely on me... What I would give to be able to change sex when I feel like it... Anyway, sorry I just, it stinks. It really does. But like I said, only three people know. My bestfriend, I'd trust her with anything. Another friend who is transgender and kind of gets my plight. And then a new friend that I've made this year, I've told her a lot and we're really close. All three of these people that I've told, are all accepting of me. I'm not afraid to come out to my friends, well, I am, but not like a lot. My teachers, I really couldn't give a shit about what they think honestly. My parents, I know that they'd accept it, eventually. But, there's all this confusion going on. There's so many genders and sexualities and some are overly specific, some mean the exact same thing as others, some have multiple meanings that each claim is the right one. It's confusing. I get it. And there's the whole 'Transtrender' bull shit that comes with it. Suddenly everyone isn't just fit neatly into the whole binary area and everyone is different. A lot of people are a bit stigmatic towards all of this. My parents are. I think that if I said that I was genderfluid that they wouldn't take me seriously at first. I think that they would in the end. But perhaps the scariest thing, and the hardest for me to come out about. is wanting to transition. And this is kind of the thing I wanted to talk about. I came to the conclusion girls where better than guys along time ago. I can prove it through anatomy, history, society, a lot of things. While men are stronger then women on average, women can do things men can't. Women can give birth for one (just to be clear I know if I transitioned to a girl I wouldn't be able to give birth, nor would I want to, I can't stand pain and don't want to be a parent). I'll gloss over the fact of how women and orgasms work... And of course women do have to deal with periods, which, just... Respect, okay, respect. In history women have proven to be more accepting and generous. I could go on, but don't feel like it. I've always gotten along with girls slightly better than guys. And I find that if I fantasize about men (which is usually when my genderfluidism appears, sexually) I'm more often the girl with a guy than the guy with another guy. I've given it a lot of thought. And I want to be a girl. I'll be happier being constantly female than constantly male. And I know that at some point I'll begin to feel like a guy, because I'm genderfluid and it changes. But I think I'm okay with that. It's the sacrifice I'll make to be happy. I can't change when I want, so I'll change to what I want most. This is going to be the scariest to com out about. To everyone.
And that's it. That's everything. All I want is some advice. Some opinions on all of this. What I'm going through. What I'm going to do. And most importantly, advice about transitioning. I've tried researching it, but couldn't find anything that answered my questions exactly. I'm going to put a list of questions I have below. This is a really long thing to read. And if you read it all, thank you. Would you be even kinder, and maybe help me out? I don't really have anyone to ask these things or to talk about this stuff with. So, if you do respond and help me.. God, I, I can't say how much it will mean to me. But, if you do, than thank you. Thank you so much.
How does the voice work? I have a deep voice. I've been thinking on it, but this is the only conclusion: If one undergoes transitioning before puberty or during early puberty, their voice won't get deeper and they won't sound like a boy. If one goes through transitioning after puberty or during (to the point where it's to far to matter), than their voice will remain male sounding and they'll have to use a fake voice to sound like a girl. I don't think that's right, it's just what I've pieced together. I really don't want to have to pretend to sound like a girl. So how does it work?
How long will it take? I know that it varies upon age and body and a lot of other things as well. But how long might it take for me?

[transgendered] Pronoun trouble?,"So, I strive to be a good ally. I don't have any trouble with using someone's preferred pronouns, generally, because virtually all the trans people I know transitioned before I knew them... However, I have one trans-feminine friend that I knew before her transition, and we haven't seen each other since... She recently contacted me online, and let me know she's still living in the same city with her wife (cis-woman, married prior to transition). My question is this: if we happen to meet up and start talking about 'old times' (pre-transition) I am worried I might inadvertently use a wrong pronoun... Is it generally frowned upon to use a pronoun matching the gender-expression that was current at the time of an event in the past? Maybe I'm over-thinking this; but, **having known her prior to her transition, makes it difficult for me to parse, and accurately describe experiences we had together, prior to her transition,** ***to third parties...*** Especially if some of them didn't know her then!

What am I?,"I'm confused on my sexuality. I'm pretty sure I'm pansexual but whenever I ask someone what that is or what that means they give me stupid answers like 'they'll date mailboxes and animals' which I know isn't true. 
I think being pansexual means you don't care about gender at all, while being bi means you only like boys or girls. I just want other people's options on what being pansexual is and what being bi is. 
In high school I only dated boys but I was always attracted to girls but never acted on it. 
After graduating I started dating a girl and everyone freaked out, 'omg now you're a lesbian?' 'Or you have to be a lesbian bc bi people are sluts' 
Once we got serious I started telling everyone I was just a lesbian bc they made being bi seem like a bad thing and it was easier just to shut everyone up that way.
About a year later we break up. 
I start having feels for another guy but don't act on it bc everyone is telling me I should be a lesbian.
Guy moves it's over. 
Few month later start dating another girl who I really like and am still dating, BUT 7 months into our relationship they tell me they're trans (FTM). 
At first I was unsure if I wanted to continue in the relationship but then I realized screw it who gives a FUCK I love this person. 
So now I have a wonderful boyfriend who's amazing, BUT he feels weird sometimes bc he thinks I'm a lesbian. 
I don't know if I should even bring up that I was never actually just a lesbian or not. 
I'm not sure if him and I will get married so I'm also confused on who I would date if we ever broke up.

Pansexuality IS Real [Rant],"So, recently coming out as Pansexual to my family and friends (I'm 16 so school :D) has sparked some controversy. My friends are all super nice and accept who I am. Which is lovely and much better than most people coming out, I honestly have a lot to be thankful for. But one of my closest pals will not accept I am Pan, he tells me I cannot be as it does not exist; I have to be Bi. He says to him that orientation is only based on sex and not gender whatsoever. It has really frustrated me (especially the transphobia he continued with). Also when I came out to my mum she said ""So is that just a glorified Bisexual?"" I laughed and explained but she was excited to learn. We are real and I hate being put down like I am some psycho. Why do they think they can define me when they are not me.

I was wondering how many others of us experience this, is it common? I struggle to express myself outside of my head so does anyone have any advice on how to explain it better to heterosexuals? Thanks guys, love you &lt;3",pansexual

Maintaining queer / pan identity in a hetero relationship,"Hey folks,

I don't really care about my label.,"The more ive grown over the years from a budding bisexual to the pan I am today, I realize how much i couldnt give less of a fuck if people saw me as a pan, or if they even didnt understand or antything i dont think i could care.

I suppose it may have something to do with the first same sex relationship i forced myself into to ""prove"" i was bi, and subsequently got sexually abused.

I think why im trying to say this is just, dont let your sexuality or romantic interests make you do anything just to prove it to yourself or to others. ESPECIALLY if you are younger. Even the lgbt+ space isnt the safest. 

If you care enough, fight for what you believe, but if you have different things to worry about, dont try and make your sexuality a super 100% important thing to be loved and cherished, just let it be an extra thing on your ""about me"".

Very recently Reddit made me realize I'm Pan not Bi,"Hey everyone,

So I have identified as a female bisexual for over a decade and it has been a huge part of me for that time. Recently, there was a questionnaire posted on a few subreddits regarding sexuality and gender orientation which prompted a pretty in-depth discussion between my partner (lesbian) and I regarding our sexuality ""limits"", I guess you could say. 

In the beginning of our relationship we just told each other our sexual orientations and that was that, there was never a further conversation. It was just that we both knew we could work out together. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and we were having this very intense discussion on our own sexuality and gender orientation sparked by such questionnaire. I'm kind of surprised we never thought to discuss it earlier. Her orientation was basically exactly where I thought it would be as a lesbian, but as she started to ask me more questions I realized that I really didn't care about the gender binary at all when it came to sex as an act or within a romantic relationship. We found out together that I am not Bisexual but in fact I am Pansexual. When we both realized this new truth I had this feeling of 'wow, how did I not ask myself these questions before? And will she think any differently of me because of it?' In the same exciting moment I learned something new about myself I also felt incredibly vulnerable and scared that my partner would not be ok with this turn of events. It was terrifying. But, as soon as she saw those gears in my head moving that way she immediately spoke up and told me that this changes absolutely nothing between us and then kissed me :)

To be honest I don't really know why I'm posting this story. Nothing has changed in my life, I'm still with my wonderful partner. I still go to my job, practice with my sports team, eat the same food. Though, somehow I feel different. It's kind of crazy to think about how a simple definition or term can make you feel that way. Maybe because Reddit helped me find that truer part of myself I guess I wanted to share this story with you all. 

As a side note (more like side question), for those once identifying as Bisexual and now identifying as Pansexual, are there any words of wisdom you wish you had known at this stage? The very last thing I want to be is disrespectful to anyone. Before this I thought I had a pretty good handle on different sexualities and gender orientations but I guess I was just so cemented in my previous identity of bi that I never felt the need to do a self check up as my knowledge grew.

When I discovered myself.,"I used to have multiple crushes on boys and girls when I was younger so I thought it was normal. Then I found out about bisexuality and thought, this is it, this is what I am.

But as I grew older, I found myself liking people who are beyond just a male or female. I found myself liking people because of who they are as a person and not because of what was in their pants. That was just a bonus.

I continued to label myself as Bi, but it confused me to high heavens. Soon enough I looked deeper into it and found a whole new world of orientations. When I found Pansexuality I nearly cried because I had never felt so relieved of not being alone about this. I used to think I was selfish or just easy for liking more than 2 genders but now I know better.

I have found out more about what makes me who I am and I have never been more happy to be myself.",pansexual

I've had a lot of confusion and anxiety about my sexuality lately and I was wondering if people here could help me out.,"Hello dear people of /r/pansexual!

I guess I'll start off by giving a little information about myself before I go into my story: I'm a 23-year-old male, I've never been in any kind of relationship and I'm still a virgin. I've never had any interest in ""dating"" or casual affairs; if I'm going to pursue someone, I'm expecting a committed relationship. The fact that I have yet to be in a relationship can be attributed to pickiness and bad luck. I've only been truly infatuated with a handful of people and it's just never worked out for various reasons, such as them being unavailable, them being in a place in their lives where it just wasn't possible or they just simply didn't feel the same way. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I have no experience in romantic relationships, but not because of a lack of trying or want. I've previously considered myself to be straight; I've only ever had romantic feelings towards females, I find femininity incredibly attractive and I've never had any true attraction to masculinity. I feel that these three points still stand, but in recent years I've had some changes in my sexual behaviour.

A couple of years ago I accidentally came across a solo ""shemale"" video (I understand that some people consider this a derogatory term so I feel I have to explain myself: I mean absolutely no offense to anyone. I'm referring to a trans woman who hasn't had sex reassignment surgery, I'm not sure what term to use in this context, so if there is a better term, feel free to tell me.) and I was disturbed at how much it fascinated me. At first I tried to repress everything it made me feel, but ultimately my curiosity got too strong and I started to seek out similar videos for erotic purposes. After that I eventually found myself receiving erotic feelings from things such as gender bending, phallic imagery, homoeroticism and even from more questionable things like shotacon (realizing that I was getting some form of arousal from something like that really really disturbed me). At the time I just dismissed all these things as ""just a phase"", that I was just exploring my sexuality, and in any case it was just a small fraction of what I found arousing so it was easy for me not to think about it in my day to day life. I still maintained that I was straight, because for the most part I was, but every once in a while my brain would wander in to alien territory. It felt like a dirty little secret, something that I was ashamed of and could never ever tell anyone about. 

Aside the occasional bouts of shame and masturbatory guilt, I was doing completely fine not dealing with my feelings in any profound way, but lately things have changed. These past couple of months I've started to develop very strong romantic feelings (stronger than I've ever felt towards anyone else) towards a woman who is a good friend of mine and this past week my brain started wandering again for the first time since this infatuation began. I started feeling overwhelming shame and anxiety, and I felt completely despicable and unlovable, especially since I've had a couple of involuntary sexual thoughts about her with phallic appendages. I couldn't eat or sleep and I felt constantly nauseated because I was so terrified and disgusted. At this point I decided that I seriously need to start dealing with my feelings, ignoring them didn't seem to make them go away. My parents were the first people I told, and I've talked with my mom about this many times now. She's been absolutely fantastic about everything (her telling me that she's felt similar things has been especially comforting), and she's the one who brought up pansexuality, which is why I'm here now.

Recently I've been trying to embrace my own feelings (as in not trying to hide or deny anything) and then analyze and discuss them. I started researching pansexuality and I'm constantly growing more fond of the idea. I've never been too fond of any labels, but for some reason this one gives me comfort; it makes my feelings feel more natural and less perverted. But the thing is I'm not entirely sure I am pansexual since I have no romantic inclinations towards males. Is it possible to be pansexual but heteroromantic or something like that? Right now I feel that my situation is that I can have sexual attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender indentity, but I only feel romantic attraction towards females (although I don't deny the possibility that I would some day fall in love with man).

Conclusion: Even though I've been dealing with my feelings a lot, and I truly feel like I'm more understanding and accepting of myself, I still have pretty strong feelings of anxiety, fear and shame. I've been living one day at a time, but I truly feel lost right now. One of the things that I'm most scared of is; right now there is nothing I want more than to be in a stable loving relationship with the person I love most of all in the world, but what if when I get there it won't be enough to satisfy me and I start getting desires the other person is not okay with. What these desires would be and why I don't know, but the idea terrifies me anyway.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for here, but I do have a desire to share and converse with people who might understand, so if you have any insight, advice, and/or just words of encouragement or support, I would greatly appreciate that!

With Love

Coming Out As Pansexual,A while back I came out to my mum about being bisexual and she assumed it was a phase. But recently I spoke to her and told her I wasn't bisexual but pansexual.

I'm cross-orientated: pansexual and biromantic. Does anyone else here find that their romantic and sexual orientations don't match up?,"Hi! This is my first post on this subreddit. :-) I have openly thought of myself as bisexual, and identified myself as bisexual to others, for about six years now. I've always believed that love is love, regardless of how anyone identifies or presents themselves! However, when I heard of the term ""pansexual"" a couple of years ago, it immediately appealed to me.

My understanding of the term ""pansexual"" is that it describes an ability to be sexually attracted to people who occupy any place on the gender spectrum, without restriction. This is exactly how I experience my sexual attractions. I've found that a person's gender identity, genitals, and the way they present themselves has never mattered to me when it comes to deciding whether I want to sleep with them or not. The only important thing is whether I feel safe and comfortable enough to be intimate with them. Of course, I understand that many bisexual people would describe the term ""bisexual"" in exactly the same way ‚Äì I'm just saying that this is my own personal feeling on what ""pansexual"" means. I feel that a bisexual person may (or may not) have certain gender-based restrictions on who they're capable of being sexually attracted to (which is a perfectly legitimate way for someone to experience their sexual attractions ‚Äì if somebody knows what's right for them, that's all good!) while a pansexual person would have no restrictions on who they're capable of being sexually attracted to.

However, I never felt able to claim ""pansexual"" as my identity before now, because it doesn't accurately describe my romantic attractions. I've found that when it comes to choosing a romantic partner, I only feel completely comfortable and happy when that partner is a woman or a non-binary person. In the past, whenever I have dated men, I've found it easy to be physically attracted to them and appreciate who they are as people, but I've never been able to develop serious romantic feelings for them, and I have rarely been able to feel completely at ease engaging in ""couple-y"" behaviours like holding hands on the street or cuddling.

I've known for a couple of years now that I shouldn't pursue serious romantic relationships with guys anymore, because in the past, romantic attraction just didn't happen for me, the guys got upset over this, I ended up feeling like a terrible person, and things usually didn't end well. That pattern came up time and time again. :-/

This has puzzled me a bit over the past few years, but I recently read an article on cross-orientation ‚Äì where somebody's sexual and romantic orientations don't match up ‚Äì and realised that this absolutely applies to me. After giving it some thought, I can now confidently say that I am pansexual and biromantic, because there are no gender restrictions on who I can be sexually attracted to ... but when it comes to forming a serious relationship with someone, I need that person to be another woman or a non-binary person.

I used to feel guilty whenever I thought of guys I dated in the past who became upset when my lack of romantic attraction to them became clear. However, I feel so much better now that I understand why I couldn't develop romantic feelings for them, despite finding them physically attractive. I know many people say that ""labels shouldn't matter,"" but for me, having the correct terminology to describe the different attractions that I experience has made a significant difference to my peace of mind. :-) I am in a very happy monogamous relationship with my girlfriend right now, and I hope that it continues for a long time ... but if I ever find myself in a situation in future where I am sexually attracted to a guy, but know that I don't want to be romantically involved with him, I will never again chastise myself for it or think that I'm some kind of terrible person. I'm pansexual, but biromantic. My sexual and romantic orientations are different, and that's perfectly okay. :-D

I am interested in discovering whether other people have experienced similar situations!",pansexual
Bi and Pan Facts,"Hi my lovelies!

I wrote this status first on facebook, and then on tumblr, and was just overwhelmed with the responses of folks having never had this information before and their appreciation for it. So I figured I'd post it here, too, because Knowledge Is Fun For All :)

Bi Visibility Day Fun Fact:

‚Äúbi‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúgirls and boys.‚Äù bi means ‚Äúsame and different genders to yourself.‚Äù that means bi folks are plenty attracted to the whole marvelous spectrum of gender.

(then what‚Äôs the difference between bi- and pansexual?)

in a lot of cases, semantics! generally, the difference between bi and pan folks is *how* we experience attraction - bi people tend to find different things in different genders attractive, whereas pan folks tend to find the same stuff attractive in all genders. a lot of folks ID as bi simply because it‚Äôs the more well known term :)

Explaining my sexuality,"I've been very open to anyone curious on my sexuality in the past. However, I explained to a friend of mine and she looked at me like it was completely outlandish. She then proceeded to ask if I liked her and when I denied it she said I couldn't be pan. After I went into more detail on pansexuality, she didn't change this behaviour. She'll point at random people and ask if I fancy them. This incident has lower my confidence in my sexuality and now I'm not sure how to tell people. It's a fear of sorts I've obtained and I really hope I can get past it. Does anyone have any advice? ",pansexual

Tried explaining the difference between pan and bi. Apparently that makes me arrogant,"Well, yesterday I just thought I'd point out it was pansexual pride day on a forum on which I'm a manager. I expected ""What's that?"" and so was ready to explain. And in the back of my mind, I figured there'd be some who wouldn't get it and would just be like ""Ok, you're bisexual, whatever""

But I didn't expect people to start saying that I'm ""priggish"", ""sanctimonious"", or insulting them in any way. The hell is it I'm doing wrong here?

Quite honestly didn't think I'd be feeling a bit insulted myself, even if I should expect the ""your orientation isn't a real thing"" crap",pansexual

My School Peers Decide I'm Gay...I'm pansexual,"I'm your classic pansexual teenager in high school, I'm 14 and I'm trying to not throw a brick at my closed minded peers. I am new to this school, this is a new school for me due to me moving schools because I didn't fit in well and my hair cut wasn't appropriate (half of my head is shaved). 
    These are my old classmates from elementary school but a lot of new faces have come in here, these are fairly normal people. You have your jocks, rednecks, wannabes, outcasts, etc. In the beginning of the year I was seen as ""Oh look! She's gay because she hangs out with dudes and she's affectionate to a chick, let's pick on her and piss her off!"" That went on for a month or two before I confronted them in the hallway during seventh period.

   ""...um..I'm pansexual"" they then exchanged glances at each other before replying ""so..you like boys and girls yet you hang with that chick all the time, you sure you aren't a lesbian?"" 
     I'm not trying to sound overreacting but I think I know my own sexuality. Am i an overreacting teenager or are they just being as normal as they can get? How can I fix this? I don't have many friends and I'm tempted to send the dark lord of smeagle to their houses...what do?",pansexual

"Think I might be pan, but have never had experiences and don't want to be wrong, also, fit one definition of pan but not the other.","I'm socially awkward and a 17-year old girl who has never had a boy/girlfriend or even kissed a boy/girl or had mutual interest, to my knowledge. I have liked girls since I was 11, but in a very limited amount, then really started to like boys beginning in late Sophomore year.

I am substantially aroused exclusively by female arousal and dream exclusively about sex with women. For a long time, I liked boys far more often and with considerable intensity. While aware that I was not completely straight, I felt comfortable with the label and identity.

I still don't know. Sometimes boys just electrify my skin, and more rarely do I like girls, a few times every month, but I have incredible attraction when I do. Thing is, usually this dissipates toward the girl after a day and comes back again at odd times spanning years.

Today I was watching TV and suddenly the hotness and attraction to girls in my dreams went ""pow"" at me with regards to a female character. I suddenly felt attraction to many girls, and wanted to date girls in college, which I had been considering for a long time.

When I was very depressed, there was a woman online who I developed intense sexual and romantic feelings for due to the comfort she gave me, but I did not see her physically until late in our relationship, (she's not a predator.)

For a long time since I was a teenager, I didn't feel like ""bi"" was the right label, and I became curious about nonbinary genders. Some nonbinary people online I found attractive, but honestly, I don't know if I'm forcing it.

I feel that I am open to all gender identities, but I do not think an open mind constitutes a sexual identity. In addition, I seem to like girls rarely and intensely, boys frequently and moderately, girls in a more sexual way, boys in a more romantic way, (though there is an overlap), more feminine nonbinaries, and hardly ever masculine nonbinaries though some... I may very well like all genders, but I would hardly say I am ""gender blind"".

If I do like all genders, is there a way to convey that without the ""gender-blind"" definition? When do I decide I am queer? I have a preference for men, so will this affect me at all? Tbh, my attractions to women and nonbinaries feel more like recurring yet transient experiences than traits, though this may be societal conditioning.",pansexual

Research Study on Multi-partnered/Consensually Non-Monogamous Relationships,"Hi r/pansexual!

My name is Jessica and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Guelph. My research is primarily about motivation, satisfaction and intimate relationships, particularly among multi-partnered relationships (e.g., open, poly, swinging).
We are currently conducting a study entitled: Daily study of motivations and experiences in multi-partnered relationships. We are doing this in order to gain a better understanding of relationships more broadly as much of the psychological literature on romantic relationships has focused on monogamous interactions. We are also interested in learning more about people‚Äôs daily experiences in their romantic relationships. We want to learn more about the reasons people/couples engage in sexual activity within the context of romantic partnerships, how people experience satisfaction/conflict/ within their relationship and how they communicate with their partners. This research has received ethics clearance from the University of Guelph Research Ethics Board (REB #16OC017).

For this particular study, we are hoping to recruit participants from Canada and the United States, who identify as having a primary partner and at least one additional partner. We are also hoping that both the individual and their primary partner will be able to participate in the study. We recognize and understand that many people do not adhere to a hierarchical structure or use hierarchical language in their relationships. This particular study aims to understand more about relationships where there is a primary relationship structure/language and we hope to conduct more research on non-hierarchical relationships in the future.

If you are interested in the study, please read below for some more info about it and send us an email!

Thank you, 

Jessica


**STUDY INFO:**

Daily study of motivations and experiences in multi-partnered relationships.  

Do you identify as having a primary partner, and do you live with your primary partner?

Do you see any of your additional partner(s) at least once per month?
Have you had sex with any of your partners within the last month?
Are you over the age of 18?

If so we would like to invite you to participate in our study examining partners‚Äô daily sexual motivations. If you participate, you and your primary partner will be asked to complete an initial, 45 min survey about your relationship, your wellbeing and your sexual motivations. You and your partner will also be asked to complete a short 10 minute daily survey every day for three weeks and finish a follow up survey immediately after the three weeks are complete (approximately 35 minutes).

Is there anything we can do, maybe at school, or are we just out of luck until next year? Which sucks, because I'm a senior.

The survey will take 10‚Äì15 minutes. At any point, you can decide to not answer a question or discontinue participation in the survey. Those who participate will have the chance to win one of two $25 Amazon gift cards. More information is provided on the survey‚Äôs consent page. This survey will be posted in several subreddits, so please only take it once. 


To participate, you must be:
18 or older
Currently living in the U.S.

New explanation of pansexual I just heard,"I just met a girl who identifies pan. When some of my friends asked what that meant exactly, she said:

Bi people can see people in the street and think ""that's a cute guy/girl"". Pan people see people in the street and think ""that's a cute person"". 

What do you guys think about that description? I usually see the difference between bi and pan as that pan people are also attracted to non-binary people, but I also kinda like how she stated it.",pansexual
My struggle with the feeling of pan-erasure,"This is a topic I've had many an argument over and very much feel that my views and feelings on the topic are ignored and it's around the idea that pansexuality is a subset of bisexuality. I'm going to start by saying that each individual can identify however they like, this isn't about policing labels or telling people how to identify. It's more about understanding that talking about pansexuality as a subset of bisexuality means we then don't matter.

If pansexuality is a subset of bisexuality it will never matter and will never gain recognition. If we talk about pansexuality as it's own thing but with some crossover with bisexuality there is a chance we can move forward. Every time I hear someone telling me that pan is a subset of bi it makes me wonder how bi people would feel when they are told that they are just a subset of homosexuality.  

Every time I see a post about how bisexuality covers all possible options I feel like my identity is being erased.

Not sure how to personally move on from this.

Pansexuality in the military,"Hello, I recently graduated technical training for my career field in the Air Force and I have arrived at my first base. I haven't made many friends yet, but I am hoping to change that. One tip I've received is to start dressing more ""normal"". I tend to wear clothes that can be described as ""weaboo"" clothing if I can coin a term. While I have no plans on changing my sexual identity, as I believe such a thing cannot even be done (I didn't choose to be this way, I simply am), I am looking for tips on how to make friends with people. I am considering changing my clothing but what else should I do? I am accomplished in many martial arts and have extensive weapons training, which seems to be a point of contention with people rather than a point of conversation when I bring it up. Also, at what point is it appropriate to mention sexuality in a conversation? Every time I have ever mentioned that I am ""pansexual"", I get blank looks or jokes about cookware. I am very easy going (something I attribute to the inner peace achieved through martial arts), so the jokes don't offend me, but I am starting to get discouraged. I'm not trying to have sex with everyone I meet, I just want to be friends. But I'm not sure what I should be doing. Every day I feel more and more out of place. I guess I am looking mainly for advice from other pansexuals who are/have been in the military?",pansexual
Bisexual/Pansexual Men,"Whenever I sit down to write this from my perspective it gets incredibly difficult and I find myself rambling on &amp; on. I want to be like everyone else straight or simply gay and never questioning my sexual identity. Let‚Äôs keep it straight and simple right? Ever since I was a young boy I feared being identified as gay. Kids and especially young boys can be mean and hateful bullies. I am the youngest of four and the only boy; Mom &amp; Dad separated when I was 6 yo and all of my sisters had moved out of the house by the time I was 8 yo.

I often wonder what happened, what experience it was that flipped my switch to AC/DC. Was it growing up as the only boy in a house full of girls? Was it not having my father around when I was a boy? I really can‚Äôt say.

I have always identified myself a bisexual man; I‚Äôve had long-term relationships with both men and women. But I‚Äôve also found myself strongly attracted to transgendered men and women too. I‚Äôve even been attracted to lesbians that I know full good and well they aren‚Äôt going there and I would get punched in the throat if I attempted anything. So Pansexual is a really new term for me. Why am I going through a sexual identity crisis again at the age of 46 yo?

I often think of myself as just a perverted guy with an extremely strong libido. I have noticed also that because I‚Äôm bipolar I can go into manic episodes where I just can‚Äôt seem to get enough. I will wear my partner and myself down until we‚Äôre both practically raw‚Ä¶ and I still want more! And it‚Äôs not always about getting a nut. It‚Äôs about the experience, the bonding, the connection with the other person. Yes I have my kinks and for the most part I am pretty submissive with any partner. It gives me great pleasure to bring my partner to the edge and back again; seeing them enjoy themselves. I like to make it more about them than me and still get mine while I‚Äôm at it. But this is not to say that I would sleep with just anyone.

The most profoundly odd thing about it all is. It‚Äôs not just a blurring of the gender lines. It‚Äôs also race and ethnicity, young and old. Sometimes when I try to explain it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like they just don‚Äôt get it. They are too wrapped up in their picture perfect partner and bigotry. I see no color and I see no gender, instead what I see is people living life and making the most of it that they can.

Having good looks is one thing and yes everybody gets all goo goo eyed over you. But the biggest thing that does it for me is brains! Smarts and personality, will make me putty in your hands. It‚Äôs like this interconnection that I cannot explain, but they seem to be rare relationships to find and develop.

I do not go waving a flag about my sexuality. But I try not to deny it either. I find myself struggling with it actually. It seems difficult to be open about being bisexual, much less pansexual? A guy said to me, ‚ÄúHmm what‚Äôs pansexual? I mean other than men and women ‚Äì what else does that bring in?‚Äù Sometimes, I feel like the bastard step child of the LGBT community. If you‚Äôre a gay man or a gold star lesbian then you‚Äôre the standard of the gay community. The transgendered community is getting their day in the Sun with Caitlyn, what bathroom to use, etc‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre a bisexual female society more readily accepts you. Because what else is more erotic than seeing two women together and when you‚Äôre a guy with two bi girls you become the envy of the world, personally I don‚Äôt know this for sure but it just seems to be the general societal viewpoint.

Anytime I would identify as bi, gay friends said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs confused and doesn‚Äôt know what he wants.‚Äù Girls shunned me sometimes as being a perv and because I would choke up and had so much difficulty in breaking the ice I guess. I have been accused of wanting to fuck anything that walks (almost, but not quite). I think it just compounded personal self-esteem issues that I have from childhood when my grandmother would shame and ridicule me for looking exactly like my father. I always felt like there was something inherently wrong with me. Like I have some sort of poo on my face and it wasn‚Äôt coming off. Now you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm pansexual?

I‚Äôve been looking for some sort of support, others like me, people that will not judge me. I know that I can‚Äôt be the only man that is experiencing these issues. Some people that I‚Äôve reached out to think that I want to just have sex or it is some sort of invitation to it, but its more about me trying to feel comfortable in my own skin and unashamed of who I am. Not even my local LGBT community center has any sort of counseling or services for me. There are also support groups specifically for women with bisexual male partners, which is great but what about us? The guys that are struggling to find comfort in their own skin? It is so easy to get wrapped up in my own pity party, because things could be much worse.

Some days really suck with twisted and mixed feelings of feeling alone and cut off from the world. Like no one really understands. I like people, across all gender, race, and ethnic spectrums. I was asked, ‚ÄúSo if this is the case‚Ä¶ what is your ideal partner?‚Äù I really don‚Äôt have one‚Ä¶ you cast your net and whatever it brings in is the dish of the day I guess. 

Do most pan people identify this way? Do most pansexual guys feel alienated from society? Where do you find support? What do you do to feel comfortable in your own skin? You cannot possibly tell me I am the only guy that feels this way.

Questions I can't answer myself.,"Recently (within the past month) I discovered I was Pan. One hurdle over, but there's many more. I'd like to ask you all some questions since you are all knowledgeable. (FYI, I'm 19 and male.)

1. How do I date men? Now, you must be thinking, ""He just said he was Pan!"". I did, but there's a slight psychological catch here. I was molested by my Father when I was three. As you can tell, having anything of a sexual relationship is a serious problem there. How does one get around that?  
EDIT: After reading through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pansexual/comments/4qwn8r/had_an_awesome_evening_and_want_to_share/?st=irg275xz&amp;sh=54719b66) post, I was turned on. (Which is indeed a good thing.) However, I couldn't stop my mind from brushing over mental scars while reading, and had a major headache at the end :(

2. How do I come out to people who knew me beforehand? My members of my gaming clan, especially my best friends were a piece of cake. It was so smooth it was almost disappointing. Now, my Mother and basically my entire high school class are going to be the issue. The only way to come out is through facebook and that's a tad scary. Mom will always love and support me (which is great) but stress is literally the last thing she needs right now.

3. Is being open to literally any fetish normal for Pan people? With a simple change of mindset I can change what turns me on or off. (Outside of the default preferences before the discovery, plus the issue above.) If it's sexual, I can like it. I don't feel comfortable knowing this, but it could be a great asset too.

I gladly will accept any help given, Thanks!",pansexual
um. Hi?,"I'm new, obvs. I like cats and singing and video games. 

I've never ""come out"" I think only 3 of my friends really know.  

I was raised very religiously so I never let myself think about the fact that I wasn't attracted to boys like everyone else or that my first crush was a girl. I eventually got crushes on boys but it was developed pretty late in life (like university late, I thought I was asexual for a while). 

I dated guys but I'm more picky with guys than I am with girls. I think that's something people don't understand is that I like all genders but I'm more picky than anyone I know. Not sure if this is common or not, I've never met anther pansexual person.

Am I pan?,"So sorry if this post is a jumbled mess, I'm a bit scatterbrained at the moment. 

I have been thinking about my sexuality a lot lately, I recently broke up with my boyfriend who I had been with for three years.  I've always thought I was straight because I'm a female (21) who has only been in relationships with males. 

Recently I've noticed that I sometimes become attracted to people after I've gotten to know them even if I wasn't attracted to them before. 

I've been thinking more and more that I am pansexual but I feel weird saying I am because I've never been in a relationship with anyone that wasn't a man, but I'm open to the idea of being with girls or trans people. I have kissed girls before and I find plenty of women attractive, but it's been drilled in my head that it's common for girls to do that (""Oh it's just a phase!""). 

I'm not sure if I'm vastly over thinking this or what. I don't have many friends for me to talk to this about, so I thought here might be a good idea. Sorry if I'm in the wrong place!",pansexual

Is it nessesary to come out as pansexual?,"I have been comfortable with my sexuality for a few years now but Ive been having this issue whenever I make friends with new people. People tend to just assume that I'm straight and to be honest it makes me super uncomfortable because I feel like I'm not being honest? I was wondering how do you guys handle coming out to new friends or just people in general? I think its ""easier"" for gay people because when someone assumes that they're straight they can just politely correct them but when it comes to pansexuality you have to correct them and by default have to have the conversation about how bisexuality and pansexuality are two different things and honestly and blah blah blah. Is it really necessary to inform people of your sexuality? How can you come out to people without making the whole conversation revolve around it?

"I'm having some trouble. I don't feel ""accepted"" by the LGBT community and I don't know if I fit in. I feel intimidated. Anyone else ever feel this?","When I found out there was a word for what I was feeling, I was ECSTATIC. I loved knowing there were other pansexuals, especially knowing that there's this understanding and support, but I don't feel like I belong. I feel like an outsider looking in. If someone were to ask me if I'm straight, I'd say no. But if someone were to ask me if I was LGBT, I would probably say I don't know.

I know I like all genders, I just don't know why I don't feel accepted. Maybe I'm projecting or something. I'm a solitary person, so maybe the thought of a huge community causes me anxiety. I feel intimidated, like I don't deserve to be in this community or that it's not for me or doesn't apply to me.

I don't know what I'm trying to say. I just don't feel right saying I'm straight and I don't feel right saying I'm LGBT. I have a love-hate relationship with labels. If I don't have a label, I feel kinda weird and empty and when I do, I feel confined and limited. It doesn't help that I don't know many LGBT people. So I don't know. Any advice?

Coming out as pansexual at 23,"I feel as though I was a ""late bloomer"" with regard to my sexual orientation. Growing up in a small Indiana town, my family and the community in which I was raised was very conservative. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel as though you discover at a much earlier age if you're gay, whereas it may take longer for those who identify as bi, pan, etc.
I was definitely attracted to boys (exactly what I ""should"" be attracted to, given my upbringing), but of course there was that one person who made you second guess yourself. She was so sweet and smart, and had a lot of the same interests I had. At that point in my life (late middle school), I thought that it was a ""one-time thing"" and maybe I was just curious.
Through high school, I of course had various ""lady crushes"", but only ever dated men -masculine men- given that any divergence from the sex/gender ""norm"" was severely frowned upon and therefore rarely seen where I grew up. 
Eventually I found a man I wanted to stay with and really commit to. We grew up together and my family loved him, so naturally it had to be a good idea to get engaged right? 
Well we did. Directly after I graduated high school and he came back from deployment (I was 19 and he was 22). We moved to Kansas City together where I pursued a degree in psychology, and got married May of 2012. During my marriage, I came to realize that I was bisexual; the ""curiosity"" went away and I found myself attracted to people that weren't men. At the time, I didn't know about pansexuality, therefore if I wasn't straight and I wasn't gay, I must be bi. 
I held on to that identity for a while and didn't tell my now ex-husband, but he figured it out and asked me about it one day. I shyly replied that yes, I was, but the topic never really came back up. 

Let's switch gears now. 

My family. My family is a wonderful, loving, yet conservative/religious group of folks like I've mentioned earlier. When a friend or two of mine had come out as gay in the past, my mom's response was always along the lines of ""that's sad"" or ""what a waste, they were such a nice person.""  Because I was married to a man and never actually dated anyone besides a man, there was no need to come out. So I didn't, and I think the reason why is pretty obvious. 
Not until 6 months after my divorce was final and I moved to Ohio in December 2015 did I have the guts to do it. By this time, I had done some research and met people who didn't conform to ""gender norms"" who I found myself attracted to. I finally found an orientation that I really identified with: pansexuality. I began dating a non-binary individual (we're still together and very happy) who has expanded my mind and encourages me to be myself, something I've been afraid to do. 
Coming out was interesting. I came out to my brother, dad, and mom all separately. My brother didn't have much to say about it. My dad is the most open-minded person in my family and asked questions to try to see things from my perspective (he didn't agree with it, but he was and still is supportive), but my mom... That's a different story. 
I had to plan out exactly what I was going to say to her and when I would say it. Well, that plan went down the toilet pretty darn quick. 
We were in the car headed to a nearby city to go see a movie and then it happened. 
""Now that you're single again, you should see how (one of my exes) is doing."" 
""Well, mama, he's gay.""
*insert aforementioned comments here* ""well, I'm glad I don't have to worry about that. Do I?"" 
Shit. 
I broke out in some crazy, nervous laughter for a good 10 seconds. She just stared at me. 
""Oh no. Are you a lesbian?""
""No.""
""Are you bi?""
""No.""
""What are you then?"" 
So I went on to explain pansexuality as best as I knew how at the time, and those bitter, disappointed tears started rolling down her face. She asked what she did while raising me to make me this way. She asked if my divorce made me this way. She asked if I could ever marry a man again. I assured her there's a possibility of me falling in love with a man and reminded her that I'm the same person I've always been, I'm just sharing a more private aspect of myself. 
Then there was silence. 
I didn't know what else to say. I decided that it was best to stay quiet for a while to let her process what had happened. Needless to say that was the most awkward car ride I've ever had. 
I've introduced my significant other to my family and my mom has met with us twice. She's civil to my S.O., and I appreciate that, but every time I mention them, she gets quiet. But these things take time, right? 
Anyway, for some reason I felt moved to share this. I don't know you and you don't know me, but if you find yourself in a similar situation, I'm more than happy to help support you, give words of encouragement, etc.

Had an Awesome Evening and Want to Share,"TL:DR at the bottom.

I got laid finally for the first time since late May. It was with a cis male (as am I) and basically our first FWB hookup. I have recently come to understand and accept my submissive nature, and was very open and clear about that way ahead of time. I feel like it made the sex a lot better, like a lot better. He identified as verse but I am a sub with no interest in bottoming, I've topped once before and it wasn't great for me. He took the dominant role just like we discussed and was awesome at it. I told him I would get involved once things got rolling but I have never been able to take initiative or make the first move.

We met at his place when he got off work, hot boxed his car and talked before we went in, and then went inside and up to his room. He threw on [Adult Swim] and ""King of the Hill"" was on. We sat on his bed and watched maybe 5 minutes, with him constantly stealing over the shoulder glances at me. I tried to make it obvious that I knew he was looking by catching his eye and staring him down. It worked, two glances later and I timed it just right so he knew he was caught.

His response? A quick lunge at my face and a deep embrace. He quickly stripped me down at that point and began removing his own clothes.  I stood up for a moment but he pushed me back to the bed, removed his boxers, and climbed on top of me. I could feel his aroused genitals rubbing between our belly's and his tongue probing the back of my that. I also started to get physically aroused at that point.

He rolled over off of me and started pushing my head down to his pelvis. I excitedly obliged and began my sub duties (I'll admit to being a newb and not very good in this department despite my enthusiasm), taking care of every inch of his thighs with my mouth before moving in for the main course. After a few fumbles I found a rhythm that was working and I could tell from his breathing and the hip thrusts. He put his hand on the back of my head and began forcing it into his thrusts. I did OK at first, slobbering and gaging came but we were both obviously enjoying it. 

A few more punches my soft pallet and I could feel trouble brewing. I pulled my head up and he responded well by letting go and letting me up. Nothing was said, he seemed to know what happened (maybe the look on my face?). At that point he lead me to engage some frotting, petting, and kissing. After that he laid back and told me to 69 him. I got into position and was taking care of him while he did an amazing job downstairs.

Then in the heat of the moment I felt something poke at my back door. Then again with a little more force, and it actually felt really good to my surprise. As he pushed a little more I moaned and pushed back slightly to signal is was OK. He would remove his finger every now and then to apply some more saliva, and go a little bit further. It felt so good, but then as I felt his finger about to pass through and in, it got pretty painful. 

In part because his fingernails were just the right length to be sharp, but also because we didn't have any lube. I had stopped and bought a 3-pack of condoms and a 4oz bottle of lube just in case but I was so nervous I forgot them in the car, and I had to park quite a ways away because apartments. We had proceeded earlier because I had a condom on me so if we needed it, we had it.

So as soon as it hurt enough to stop I just said ""Stop"" out loud and he did immediately. I knew it couldn't go any further without lube but I really wanted to push my personal envelope based on the pleasure I had just felt and he was really turned on by my rump (which really had me turned on too because no one has ever treated it like he did). He was still on his back from 69'ing so I grabbed the condom (pre-lubricated), went over and gave him a little more oral service, and then put it on him.

I stared directly in his eyes and said ""this isn't going to work, but if you are careful, gentle, and pay attention to me we can see how far it goes. He nodded, and I have fantasized for a while of being in missionary + eye contact so that is what I went for. I lied down on my back and he approached moving from my feet toward my pelvis. I put my legs on his shoulders and once he was close to me I grabbed my calves and pulled them as close to my head as I could. 

I felt him start pushing against my doorway, which felt great, and so I maintained eye contact and gave him nods when I felt him change something and it didn't hurt. Eventually we did sadly get to a point where it wasn't working and had to stop again. He removed the condom and I went down on him again for a few minutes before finishing him by hand, outside of my mouth. He took a few moments to collect himself as I snuggled his side and rested my head on his chest. He then reached down and proceeded to finish me off by hand while kissing my forehead and letting me snuggle him. We cuddled for a few minutes after and then got dressed and he walked me out to my car.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I am super giddy right now and can't stop replaying it. He was an awesome Dom/top because he listened well and took control but didn't leave me powerless; just like I wanted üòÜ

TL:DR I finally got laid for the first time in a month and almost bottomed for the first time.

Anyway, I was hoping my story might cheer someone else up since it made my day so great. I do apologize if it is too long or graphic.

Do pansexual people have standards physically?,"I've been going through a few links here but i haven't found a clear answer. Do pansexual people have physical standards? 

As a straight person,  I am attracted to a particular type - facially and bodywise (i.e strong facial bones, slim, etc) - and find other facial/body features unattractive. For both homo/hetero sexuals i know that they find physical traits attractive as well. 

In my mind, attractive physical traits correspond to the gender of that person. Strong cheekbones on a male makes a male attractive, big lips on a woman makes a woman attractive. But with pansexual people they don't consider gender, so how can physical standards be possible?

Imagine people did not have genders but were essentially entities with physical features. Do pansexual people choose between the entities due to pleasing physical appearance or do they not have any standards at all?

How is pansexuality different from bi",pansexual

What role does the physical sex of a person play for pan people? Do you get sexual responses to both sexes?,"Apologies if this is too blatant. 


I've read the side- bar description- and I find that I can relate to a lot of it. I used to be often ""gender blind"" in my attractions, and I did also feel that I was interested in the ""tea"" &amp; and not the ""cup"".

It still is the case to some degree, but part of the process of realisation that I am more gay than anything else   has been that, I just find consistently one type of cup makes it very easy to drink the tea, and I find it beautiful (same sex). 


 Whilst with the other (opposite sex), it is like the tea is not in a cup, but in an old jam jar, in the house opposite, and I have to suck it through a leaky straw suspended across the street. 
By the time it reaches me, I still feel thirsty &amp; I have to suppress the fact that I dislike the jam jar it came from. It just isn't fun. 

I just found out that the cup matters to me, because it if it is of the wrong type, I cannot drink the tea. + I do find the cups much more beautiful than the jam- jars- so this is the physical fact about my sexuality. 

So the difference for me is that despite being ""gender blind"" in some ways, I am not ""sex blind""- it matters to me - bodies of the opposite sex are not particularly sexual to me &amp; I cannot connect well to people in male bodies. 

It makes me wonder what role does the physical side play for pan people - if it ""does not matter"" - does it mean that they virtually feel the same, but you still get responses to physical sexual characteristics of people such as breasts, bums, etc, or that you don't get such responses at all, and instead you focus on personality traits? 

so in short- does the cup matter at all- does it feature in the equation at all?

Bf (32M) recently came out to me (28F) as being pansexual. How do I help ease his social hangups and insecurities?,"Here is a bit of background:
Bf and I have been dating 9 months. I personally identify as pansexual, a switch when it comes to power/sexual dynamics in relationships, and non binary when it comes to my sexual attractions. He grew up in an abusive and homophobic upbringing, but for the most part he has done amazing self reflection and therapy to help him overcome many aspects of his past. He has never dated anyone like me: meaning I am completely confident, transparent, and secure in my sexuality. I wont get into too much details, but through our relationship he has had somewhat of a sexual awakening and is beginning to break down those societal pressures of what it means to be a man and has had a lot of clarity  concerning the lopsided values our society places on being masculine. Last night after some deep conversation he blurted out that he thinks he is pansexual. I reassured him that I thought that was amazing he feels comfortable sharing that with me and it only makes me feel more connected, and attracted to him! He hears me, but because of his homophobic upbringing he is having a hard time accepting that he can still identify with being masculine and not be straight. Men and Women of this sub-reddit; any suggestions on how I can help him feel less insecure about this? I would really appreciate the feedback. How can I help him understand that being pansexual does not make him any less of a man? Any and all suggestions welcome, even if they stray off this topic a bit that's fine. I am just trying to help expand my thinking on this to better help transition my partner into this new chapter of his sexuality. Thanks so much. :)",pansexual
"I want to come out soon. (Pansexual, genderfluid) I am quite nervous! Any advice or sharing your own experience would be really helpful.","So. This last year has been quite insane for me.

A little backstory- I am a girl. That is- I am a female, born female. But pretty much my entire life I have had a lot of gender confusion. Sometimes it was mild- feeling odd with gendered expectations, sometimes it was severe, with full blown dysphoria. This caused a lot of pain especially in dating as I would begin to date cis guys as a ""girl"", only to have everything fall apart as dysphoria set in. The few men I braved actually talking about my issues with, responded with horror and disgust. So for many years I tried to be ""normal"" and as female as I could manage. It.... didn't work out. This might be a story some of you are familiar with- where trying to bury yourself ended with self-loathing, substance use, so on, and so forth. Everyone knows you're a wreck and can't figure out why.

Fast forward to my new beginning- in recent years, I began to understand that there was something different. I began to delve deep into /r/lgbt and from there, lots of other subreddits about gender and sexuality. Over several years, I began to quietly educate myself, feasting on the pictures and stories of beautiful, happy, real queer people. But for a long time, I was scared  wasn't ""queer"" enough, that as someone who was still searching for her identity I wasn't welcome. So I started the cycle again. I was in yet another relationship with a man who couldn't understand what I was going through, and I had one final breakdown. I could have died. And I decided I owed it to my friends, my family, and to those beautiful, incredible inspiring brave people who shared their stories to stop pretending.

So I am now living in my own space. A few of my closest friends know what I'm going through, and though I am still in the closet with the rest of the world, I know I can go up to them and tell them about a new step in my journey, and they will quietly but ferociously cheerlead for me. I met a beautiful pansexual trans girl who understands all of me. I've never met someone in my entire life who got *me*, as in- this intense inner gender turmoil. She's made me feel like myself- that the pain and agony from my ""gender issues"" were simply because I was trying to be someone I'm not.

At this point, I turn 30 in just a few years. I refuse to repeat this cycle, or waste my time any more, trying to love people who try to fit me into the box they like, and reject me cruelly when I don't fit. I refuse to be afraid to love the people I love! 

So, here I am. I'll probably come out via Facebook, because most of my family is out of state and that's often the best way to communicate, and because that is the shared platform for most people I know. Does anyone have any advice or experience with that? Also- explaining gender fluidity and pansexuality in a way that makes sense to people who have a much less nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality?",pansexual

"Do you have a ""Type"" that is consistent for all genders?","I am Pan but I lean a little more on the femme side in my preference. So my type: I am a sucker for geeks and artists.

I love seeing folks who have interesting outfits, especially if they are unconventional. Colored hair is a plus but I can't have colored hair cause of work.

"Decreased libido, confused","I recently went through a break up and I think that it's killed my libido. I used to think about sex a lot.

I mean I get a lot more things done lately, but I miss getting horny and can't seem to get that feeling anymore. My ex severely disrespected me and I think I may be turned off from men now because of it. I tend to get passionate and protective of certain women I meet and I'm thinking of maybe focusing my attention away from cis men. I feel like I shouldn't be chasing any sort of relationship, but I miss sex and giving pleasure to people. One night stands don't do it for me, I need raw emotion and connection but I can't seem to find that lately. I've been starting to research polyamorous relationships because I think I'd like to take a backseat in relationships and be a secondary partner to someone or multiple people but I don't know where to go with that. My emotions, libido, and sexual orientation is all confused and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've been thinking of attending some sex clubs or beginner dungeons nights to explore more but I don't really know what I'm after.

14 and pansexual,"Hey! I'm fourteen and I'm a pansexual teenager.

The reason I identify as pansexual is because I have had crushes on girls, guys and non binary people, and are sort of in a relationship with a non binary person now. I'm also open to dating any gender and don't really include gender as a factor for dating people.

So far I'm out as bisexual instead of pansexual to my parents and friends for a few reasons.

1) No one knows what pansexual means.

2) I only realised I didn't feel *quite* bisexual.

3) People would think I'm weird and have sex with pans.

13 and Pansexual,"Hey guys! This is my first time posting to Reddit, and I thought that this was a good place to start. I'm 13 and I think that I identify as pansexual but I am still quite confused. It's hard being open to the world, and every time I say that's I'm pan to someone, I wait for them to ask me if I have sex with pans. Anyways, the point of me posting about this is that I wanted to ask people a question. I don't really 100% know if I'm pan, bc I am attracted to all genders/sexualities yet for some reason I tend to be more 'nervous' around females and I become more self conscious. It might just be the whole stigma surrounding boys and girls and such, but I have noticed that I tend to sometimes notice females allot more then I notice men. But I am still open to all relationships no matter their gender or sexuality, as I wouldn't turn down someone just because of their gender/sexuality.",pansexual

I have believed that I am pan for 2 years. My friends often joke about me having sexual relations with a table, and all is good.

sex repulsion? i'm not sure? help?,"hello hi reddit.
so, i went to google first and typed in a hundred different searches with no luck so i thought i'd turn to this little sub-reddit for some advice.
i'm not sure how to word this exactly, but i think i might be experiencing some level of sex repulsion. i'm currently not in a relationship (but i do have feelings for a close friend) and have casual sex every few months or so. i've always been perfectly fine with hooking up and it's never been a problem for me. a couple months back i was hooking up with someone when it happened for the first time. i felt disgusting, i wanted this guy to stop touching me, i started crying during foreplay, and i just laid there choking back my tears wanting it to end while he finished. after the nightmare ended i sat in my bedroom crying, shaking, and so confused. nothing like that had ever happened before and it terrified me.
i steered away from sex for awhile after that because i was scared. i ended up hooking up with a friend and it went smoothly to which i was very relieved. but the other night i dipped my toes back in the water only to find those same feelings of disgust coming back in a different way. foreplay was fine, no big deal. but the second it turned into actual penetration i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw him off of me and make it all stop. i took some deep breaths and told myself to chill out and managed to calm down, but i'm confused.
has anyone else ever gone through this? i feel broken and weird and i don't know what to do to fix this. ",pansexual

On Questioning,"Ever since I was a little girl, I always envied the little boys. I lived in a place where all that I was exposed to was straight, and I was jealous that the little boys would eventually be able to choose their spouse out of the female population. I thought that girls were so pretty and graceful that it was easy to see who you would want to marry.

Ridiculous kid logic, I know, but the thought remains true. I was jealous that the little boys could be attracted to girls.

I grew up a bit, and towards the end of elementary school, I realized that I was in fact attracted to boys. And in middle school I learned about how some people are gay. I was honestly quite intrigued by this. I didn't know anyone that was gay, and I didn't truly know how any of that worked. And the more that I learned, the more that I realized that that's something that I've felt all along. Why I thought girls were so pretty and why I was so jealous of the little boys.

But I liked boys, so I pushed the idea away. I couldn't be gay. I liked boys.

It wasn't until the end of middle school that I learned that it was possible to like both genders. I had heard stories of people that are bisexual, and my thoughts were ""Yes! That's what I am!""

But that didn't feel completely right. I wasn't ever attracted to people because of their body parts and looks. I always liked people because they were smart or kind or funny. Sure, I appreciated appearance, but I was never truly attracted to someone because of it. 

Then I finally learned about pansexuality. Attraction to personalities. I didn't realize it at first, but it perfectly described me. I began to identify as pan, but only to close friends because I still lived in a place where LGBT+ people are barely tolerated. 

I identified that way for a while, and I still do, but since then, I started dating a guy that's perfect for me. I started losing interest in everyone but him. Including girls. He began to make me question my sexuality even more. Maybe I was just straight the entire time and just making a big deal of things because I was unsure.  

I still don't know who I am, or who I'm attracted to, or if I should even care at this point. My boyfriend and I don't plan to break up, and if I never date again does it matter? Do I really need to know if I'm pansexual if I'm going to stay with him?",pansexual

I just need to write some thoughts out.,"So. I've only within the past year begun to identify with being pansexual. I've always sorta known I was bi, but never explored it or ""came out"" in any way. Most people likely assume I'm straight. I knew I wasn't straight, but hadn't taken the time to actually sort out and 'label' my feelings and attractions. 

I am a cis woman, married to a cis man who was my highschool sweetheart. We're in our late 20s, and started dating halfway through highschool. We are in a monogamous relationship and have both said we'd be too jealous to try anything else. So that's fine and easy. I love my husband dearly. I've only been with other cis ""men"" (really, boys not men at that age, Lol) before my husband. 

So determining what my sexuality is isn't exactly relevant or important in my life, but I want to sort it out for myself. I think I'm pansexual. I'm like 90% sure. Unless there's something I'm missing, I've finally figured it out. I find myself sexually attracted to anyone. I think I saw someone wrote ""hearts not parts"" and it really resonated with me. Bodies are different in all sorts of ways, and while I have preferences, nothing is a deal breaker. I think everyone has preferences though right? I mean blonde vs brunette, short vs tall, broad vs lean, etc. I find myself attracted to anyone, not just cis people, which I think it's what stops me from being comfortable saying bisexual. It just doesn't feel right for me. 

I feel weird actually saying I'm pansexual though. Admitting it (admitting isn't the right word, but whatever) to myself and my husband was easy, but I don't think I'm going to ""come out"" as pansexual. On one hand, I really don't need to. The plan is to never have to date again, so it's kind of a useless piece of information. Also, I don't want to potentially cause any issues for no reason. My mom probably wouldn't care, but I know it would make my dad really uncomfortable. We've had a shaky relationship in the past, so I don't need the stress of causing more tension there. 

Also, I feel guilty using the term pansexual when I've had absolutely none of the struggles of the lgbt+ community. Since everyone probably assumes I'm straight (since I've never said otherwise and it's pretty much the default) and I'm in a monogamous heterosexual relationship, my life has been simple and comfortable in that regard. I've never been shamed or ridiculed for my preferences. I've never been disowned or hurt because of my choice in partner. My husband and I naturally conceived our children. We had no trouble getting married. I just don't feel like I ""belong"" in that community because I'm not living any of it in my life. I recognize that I have a lot of privilege concerning my sexual history and life and I don't want to claim a part of something I don't deserve? I feel like if I say I'm pansexual and make it a ""thing"" to come out then I'm making the conversation about me.. It just feels selfish. 

So that's where I am with all that. I dont even know if all that made sense. I just needed to get it out. Thoughts/advice/concerns?

Thanks. :)",pansexual
Soooo....I'm Pansexual! :),"I know that this is one of those things where it's strange to be telling the internet (where I don't know anyone) such a personal thing, but in all honesty, I'm the only one who knows this about myself and it simply just feels good to write it down and tell the world ~ not because it's my sexuality really, but because I want to celebrate my discovery of something important about myself and my no longer state of being slightly confused. I've always questioned why do people who are not straight feel inclined by society to announce their sexuality ~ if straight people don't ""have"" to announce such things, we don't ""have"" to either, (in short, people who are straight should also be announcing their sexuality, so that equality forms ~ at least in my opinion ~ so that not only non-straight people are announcing that they're ""different"" ~ there will instead be no ""difference"" and everyone will feel natural and there will be less insecurity for certain people) but, in my case at least, it's a personal thing where I'm not really sure, I just feel like announcing it ~ again, not because I want to announce my sexuality per se, but because I want to announce a discovery of myself and to share my happiness :) Thanks for being here to celebrate with me haha :)",pansexual
"Short-handing my orientation away from pan, and being presumed ""easy"". [x-post with r/bisexual]","I just wanted to throw this out there and see if anyone else has had similar experiences. I'm 28 [cis m / San Francisco] and have identified as pan since 22. Most of the times I've used the word ""pan"", people don't know what I'm talking about, or have a skewed perception, so I've found it's easier to just say ""I'm queer"" or ""I like both"" (if it comes up at all) and avoid being forced into an educator role.

That said, when people think you're bi, or think you're pan, it seems like they assume you must be hypersexual, attracted to everyone, and quietly hoping for a mixed-gender orgy at all times - along with other stereotypes, like ""so you're just a (confused, immature) bisexual who wants to feel like a special snowflake"". Has anyone else experienced this brand of stereotyping as well?

For me, the opposite of those presumptions has actually been true - when I was a young teenager, I thought I was straight and was attracted mostly to a wide variety of girls. As I aged and became more intimate with the true nature of my own sexuality, my tastes became narrower and narrower, and now I am one of the pickiest people I know. There are very few people - men, or women - to whom I'm attracted. So for me, being *capable* of arousal with cis males, cis females, and everything between actually made it harder to find partners who *do* arouse me.

If anyone else has dealt with this brand of stereotyping and is willing to share their experience, I'd be grateful.

Need help figuring shit out,"Hi, I'm a 23 years old autistic MtF. Since my early teenage years I've considered myself asexual since it makes the most sense. I don't find anything appealing with watching porn, and I haven't ever been able to masturbate. The sexual stuff just isn't there for me.

Now I'm transitioning and have been four months on estrogen, and while what I've written above is still true there's something new that has made me start to question things. I've found that if I let my mind wander to a scenario where I'm imagining myself really close to someone - like in a shower or cuddled up in bed on a cold winter day - it stirs up something in me, and it feels good.

Note that this only works if I think about it in a really ""squinting"", abstract way, the magic is lost if I go into more detail.

I am also, however very attracted to women (and I mean like biologically female: gender identification/femininity isn't really relevant to me). I have never been with a woman and didn't really start to discover or be okay with this fact 'til I was already in this relationship.

If I haven't ever been with anyone who isn't a male can I even be pansexual? I feel like I am and could see myself being in love with females or males (who identify with any gender, really) but I haven't ever given it a try because I'm sort of just now discovering this about myself.

Thoughts on Pan vs Bi?,"As everyone experiences sexuality differently, it follows that everyone has a different perspective on what the labels mean. What is the difference between bi and pan to you?

From my understanding, bisexual is an attraction to two or more genders. Some people say it's just liking binary cis people but most who define it as that aren't bi so I don't think a lot of bi people feel that way (plus that delegitimizes trans men an men and trans women as women).

Pansexual is attraction to all genders, but for me, (I am panromantic, demisexual) I see it as attraction regardless of gender. Though I know that not all pan people have that particular apathy towards gender.

So for me, pan and bi are very different (one being attraction to a variety of genders and one being attraction regardless). What are your thoughts?",pansexual

Overwhelmed,So I am wondering if this makes any sense to anyone. I can't stop being me no matter how much I want to color inside the lines. I have been in the military and worked with law enforcement so that reinforces the need to conform to the rules that others have set for me. I have never really seen how my friends and family see the world. I myself despite all things but my sexuality am black and white but when it comes to what attracts me I just can't seem to describe it. I accept people for where they are at and do not judge or have any real expectations. I have never been driven by what people look like. I only seem to see the heart and soul of the person. The person's mind is what keeps me captivated. I have problems accepting who I am because I feel that I am so different from the people I meet. When I hear them talk I just realize how much of an outsider I really feel. Does anybody else here feel alone because of our sexual identity? I mean my close friends know that I am pansexual and so do my parents but it can be difficult on relationships when no matter how much you try to explain it when you yourself aren't quite sure how this works but still know that you are different. That doesn't even begin to describe the disaster that is me when I am in a relationship. I was in a relationship with a girl that was bisexual and it was a disaster. She knew I was pansexual but yet insisted that I see the world from her point of view because I still could sleep with both genders so she felt that this made me bisexual. The ramblings of my mind go into overdrive trying to figure out my place in this world and for some reason there is a lot of fear in not knowing my place or knowing people like myself.,pansexual

Another note, I'm out to all of my friends, and am actually very close friends with two other fellow pan girls!

Anyway... My mom and I were talking one day, and it somehow went to the topic of my sexuality. She said to me, ""I don't think you know what you are.""

I'm absolutely steamed. This is *who I am.* Now that I've discovered my sexuality in the last few years, I've felt more comfortable with myself and being in my own skin. So what if I haven't had the opportunity to date someone of the *opposite sex* yet? This doesn't change who I am!

My Struggles with pansexuality,"hello forum,

I am a 17y/o from SE England, and identify as pansexual. I have grown up in a small town where being LGBT was generally accepted, however it was just gay, bisexual or lesbian people in my town. so anything other was quite unheard of.

In the past couple years I considered myself as bisexual but when I realised that gender wasn't just a biological thing and was how you identify and how you feel as a person. This made me realise that I could love someone however they identified. From this point I had looked into this to realise this was a thing and found out the name.

Now I identify as pansexual, and it is a struggle coming out to new people because of the constant explaining that it isn't the same as bisexuality. (and that I don't have a kitchen equiptment fetish)
Another struggle is that their never seems to be anyone in my town or in towns around that are non-binary when it comes to gender. so it almost becomes a case of me being bisexual despite identifying as something else.

SO I am officially opening some suggestions for images for flair to decorate your username, and looking for suggestions to spruce up this sub.

Come on all! We love anything not dead and with a pulse, as mentioned by someone else, we are the wildcards in a deck of Uno.

We are weird, inclusive and the funnest bunch around.

**So here are my suggestions**

*Take all the flags available for sexual and gender identities, but go further than that.
* Include some less used pansexual and other identity logos.

*Anything fun that starts with ""Pan"" and is a thing should be flair option.*

* Panther
* Panfrying
* Pantsuits
* Pantyhose  (for the fabulous of course).
* Pantone colour chit (shut up I'm still at heart a bit of a graphic design snob).
* Pandas
etc Also dibs on Panther... ok you all can have one too.. maybe comes in pink yellow cyan black or overlaid with the flag
* Unicorns using appropriate colours
* A chameleon, because we can kinda be anywhere (could also be overlaid with flag colours)

*Anything that relates to being a ""wild card"".*

* The joker card
* Uno Wild card (Seriously for the one who said this before I can't stop laughing at that comment).

*Popular culture references*

* Charlie Day's face from It's always sunny in Philadelphia (specifically from the episode when he yells ""I'm The WILD CARD!!!"" and jumps out the back of a moving van) ... actually dibs on charlie ;).
* Dean's face from Community (as his character is Pansexual).
* Miley Cyrus's face

**Need suggestions of not white people**

*Random little logos*

* Rainbow
* Rainbow with the Pan colours
* Small heart with pan colours
* A cog with X over it (not parts, get it?)

Would also like some suggestions that include people not exclusively identifying as female or male. Because everyone from girls and boys that dress up as each-other, to trans people, to the Genderless needs to be included. So I would defer to them for these suggestions. Admiral Akbar's face could be funny to some, but it can be terribly offensive to others. I don't identify as a ""trap"" thus I don't get to make that call. I would happily use Charlie Day's face to represent myself, but only I am able to make that call. So be conscious of your suggestions.

Remember we're all weird, so lets make this place fun, silly and most of all inviting. Some people might be deep in the closet, some people might be just here for some laughs, but we all win when are positive together. ",pansexual

"Comfortable and experienced Pansexual guy here, maybe I can help field some questions","Pansexual male here, very experience, and currently dating a guy.
I've dated women, MtoF trans people, gender queer, other gender and non binary. I've had few serious relationships, but I don't fault it to my sexuality. My sister is straight and she has the same dating issues as me.


I know understanding your own sexuality is hard. But take it from me... 

Rule number one, you define what pansexual (or any label you choose or not choose) means to you. 

Number two, no one can define it for you.

Number three, when you feel you don't sit on any end of any spectrum, the world is your oyster and take it as a blessing. Because yes, some days you do get to ""choose"" what you like and other days you don't choose, and other days you just don't know. 

Number four, rule number three may not apply universally.

Number five, and this is the most important rule, be yourself, because you can only be you. When I was first experimenting, I put on a more stereotypical effeminate character a few times, it wasn't me. Nor was being a beefy stereotypical masculine type. If walking around with a tree costume asking Australians if there is a garden somewhere to take up root is comfortable to you, then be that. Because with 7 billion people, statistically there are at least a few people that dig that. I put right on my dating apps that I like weird people, because they are awesome.  

Number six, there isn't any more rules, because unfortunately it is up to you to rationalize what makes sense and what you like and don't like. Moreover, how other sexual identities understand themselves likely don't apply because of how fluid it can be. That said, I've found bits and pieces from many sources about known gender and sexuality types can be relatable, when you piece it together as a whole. Perfect example of how different Pansexuality can be, I feel I have spheres of preferences that can be as specific as a body oder, emotional, dates, cuddles, bed fun etc. Generally I prefer Trans body smells, cuddles with Women, and taking a sub role with Men. But those preferences are often found unreliable, as I am frequently pleased in unexpected combinations of spheres. At least.. that is how I rationalize it, and I never know what the future holds.

Yes the village can sometimes be scary. It isn't, but it's not easy when you feel you are forced into one sexuality type. Just remember, a lot of this is self inflicted. Yes there are people that will stick this idea into your head, I know this because I have a very good friend whom genuinely believes I will end up fully Gay, from his own experiences. But only you are in control of you, not them. Overcoming this, makes any Village show it's true colours, a place of welcoming.

Last bit of advice, when you feel ready, put right on your profile for Tinder, OkCupid, whatever app you use that you are Pansexual. Because if they aren't ok with that from the profile, hiding it and reviling it later wont work either. I put right on my profile that I am (and I'm paraphrasing here) Open, pansexual, and Trans friendly. The guy that I am seeing was drawn to me because of this. He had a limited understanding of what pan was at the time, but his curiosity only drew him closer as I explained. We've been dating 7 weeks now.

So with that said, I'm sure many people are scared, worried, confused, or even just curious. But maybe I can help. Please ask me anything and I will try to answer. Please keep this thread a safe space for everyone. ",pansexual

Absolutely cannot accept that I am pansexual..,"Yes, I will say it online. Yes, I am subscribed to /r/genderqueer and frequently lurk it. And have said I am pansexual there.

But I cannot accept it myself, in reality. I have tried talking with this about my current therapist, but she isn't very .. specialized in this sort of stuff. I have talked about it with my partner but as I tried to say the words, I just felt .. incredibly stupid, and insignificant, and a great deal of self-hatred. I was raised in a conservative Christian family, though I do not live with them, I visit sometimes I hear comments about how ""being gay is just wrong"" and how ""[queer] people are just gross."" Being GQ/non-binary, and pansexual, I almost burst out crying hearing my family say this about me ..

"Learning new words, good by bisexual hello...?","I am 29, I have had a long confusion about my sexuality. I realized I liked girls around sixth or 7th grade, maybe earlier.  I knew I liked boys in maybe fifth grade. Though as I got older and my first male experience didn't pan out and I had my first girlfriend, I thought I was a lesbian. That lasted from 11th grade till freshmen year of college. Then I went back to being bisexual, and loving cis men and cis women equally. Now that I have gotten older and work with the public in retail, I have found their are more then just one gender and three sexualities.  I find I like (all depending on each individual, not all in one catagory) cis men and women, some trans men and women, transvestites (think of the comedian Eddie Izard) androgynes women (like Ruby Rose, I think that's her name) and and I guess gender bending women, like masculin but still retains some femininity. I also like really masculine men, like the lumberjack look.  

Now with all that in mind, am I pansexual or polysexual? I don't really know... Can you help me out.  Not that it truly matters, I have been with the same man for 7 years, but it would be nice to know.

Thanks so much",pansexual
"Thoughts on ""gender blind""","I've seen some discussion online about gender-blindness  and its relation to pansexuality

some people have been upset that a lot of people explain pan as having gender-blind attraction. They don't personally define it that way nor do they feel gender blind themselves. What do you all think? 

I'm curious to see what different sides of the Internet have to say. Also have any of you taken issue with the term ""gender blind"". I've heard some critique and am interested in other people's opinions.

Staying true to myself,"Recently I have had so many life changing things happen. It's kind of freaking amazing. I have also come to the conclusion that I need to be true to myself. I was always really good at hiding my interests, hobbies and even the way I dressed because I have always had this paralyzing fear of not being accepted. I have come to terms that style wise I am like Hyde (from that 70's show) if he were a blonde girl that is. I have come to accept that I love video games and manga, I like going to cons in cosplay. I love playing the shit out of the drums. And at times I am gender fluid but most of all I am a pansexual. Holy crap it felt good to say all of that. ",pansexual

For me, realizing I was pan was a natural part of growing up and learning about myself, so it's easy to think that other people just haven't had that epiphany yet.

Im confused about my sexuality :(,"I am genderqueer, but was born female and go by female pronouns. I am 15. And since I was 10 ive been confused about my sexuality. It kind of haunts me everyday that I just cant tell what I like. In 6th grade I started identifying as bisexual, in a more carefree kind of way. As I realized it wasnt a face and that I was attracted to more than just females and males, I discovered the sexuality ""pansexaul"" and thought that defined my sexuality pretty well. So from 7th grade until now thats what ive been going with. I only have one friend and he knows. I recently got into a break up with a boyfriend of 10 months. Im heartbroken yes but I think its a good oppurtunity for me to discover more about my sexuality. I know for 100% certainty im sexually attracted to all genders. Male, female, ftm, mtf, genderqueer, gender non binary, bigender, etc. But what im confused about is my romantic feelings. I know I can feel romantic feelings for a male, but its difficult for me to picture myself with a girl. I have extremely low self esteem and this had made me doubt myself. Ive been called a ""attention whore"" and ""special snowflake"" a lot for my sexuality, and now im beginning to wonder if maybe I am just doing it for attention, or maybe im really trying to surpress it. I honestly cant tell anymore. So, is it possible I can have feelings for girls but its just hard for me to imagine it? Or maybe im just sexually attracted to every gender but not romantically? And if I am only sexually attracted, can I still consider myself a pansexual? Or would I just be straight with some sexual kinks?

I feel like I need to talk about my sexuality.,"First of all, this is mostly confusing because I'm in a committed, long term relationship. I'm a female, married to the guy I've been with for 5 years. When we started dating, I was a totally different person. I don't know if I was straight even then, but for religious reasons I didn't even consider anything else as a possibility. Now, I'm an adult with different feelings, less raging hormones, and no religious barricades on the way I view sex. I completely reject the notion of binary gender, and I don't feel like sexuality is a black and white issue.

Already being in a relationship when my views on sexuality and gender changed makes it kind of difficult to figure out how I really feel. In no way do I want to be with anyone else, I just kind of want to talk about it and figure out who I really am. For starters, the reason I think I am better described as pan than bi is because I don't care about gender at all. I don't care about genitals, identity, etc. of my current (or hypothetical) partner. Even my sexual attraction to people is not an attraction to their body, but to who they are as a person. When I am in a relationship, the reason I want to have sex is not to satisfy a physical urge, but the desire to bond emotionally with the person I have feelings for. 

It's really frustrating to try and explain this to people. A lot just don't understand that pansexuality exists. If I try to explain it, people will say I'm just bisexual and need to be a special snowflake, and talk about identifying as some made up, inanimate object gender. I just feel like, ""yeah, fuck me for actually feeling a certain way. Forget that there's a name for it and it's legitimately different than bisexual. I'll just not be anything you haven't already heard of, because I don't want to make you have to learn anything new."" 

My gender identity is confusing as well, and that's something I've never discussed with anyone, not even my husband. I don't want to make a big deal of it or make him feel awkward, but I still want to figure out who I am as a person. It's important to me, but I just don't know sometimes. I know I'm not trans. I sometimes even feel a bit of dysphoria when someone mistakes me for a guy on the internet or something. But I also don't really feel like a woman. Sometimes, I feel like everything about me should be the same, except I should have a penis. I have dreams where I'm a man all the time. I fantasize about being a man and having sex. It just feels right. I have a really short haircut and look boyish, and if I ever get a glimpse of myself in the mirror looking particularly manly, I'll get giggly and look at myself a little longer. But I don't have any bad feelings about the parts I do have. I like my boobs, I like my vagina. I guess I kind of wish I had it all. Maybe gender fluid is the best word, but I never feel totally one or the other. I always feel like both/neither. I don't know what to call myself, and I wish I did. ",pansexual
Confused?,"Hi. 

So, I'm 16, and really confused.
Here's the thing. I really do think I could be pansexual. I don't feel like I could discriminate or leave anyone out because of their gender when it comes to being able to love someone. 

But right now, I say I'm bi. Why would I do that? 

I'm weird like that. I wanna be sure. Until earlier this year, I called myself straight because I'd never been attracted to a girl. I didn't feel like I could say I was bi because what if I was wrong? Well, then I was attracted to a girl. And I've been attracted to them since then also. So I was like okay, that's at least two bases covered, I can say I'm bi now.

But I still don't think that's who I am. I feel like I'm pan. But I'm afraid to say it? Y'know? I've never been attracted to a non-binary person but I know I could be?

Do you think I should just get over it and say what I feel? Or should I keep saying I'm bi until I'm sure?

"Problem interacting with people, I think it might be my sexuality? [F28]","I've always had problems with finding and maintaining strong relationships (mostly friendships) because I think I might be pansexual.

Preamble: I am an empath so I tend to feel others very strongly and generally feel my way through life more than think through it. Most of the decisions I've made until now (career, love, hobbies) have been fear based (more so the latter) and I've wound up in a place where I've lost almost all of my friends, don't interact with my family as much as I should, and generally have a cloud of lies that follow me wherever I go. I am at a standstill with my studies because I feel like I don't belong in the program I'm enrolled in, and I have no job and I feel like this all comes back to me not being comfortable enough with my own self and sexuality to be able to connect with other people who share the same values as me.

I mean, I'm in my late twenties, I know people come out all the time and I know it's normal to question your sexuality for a long time before coming to a conclusion, but as of right now, the only person I can stand to be around who I actually feel comfortable with is a female friend who is bisexual (same age). I haven't mentioned this to her, and I don't want to because I know she has a crush on me and I don't feel like opening that door because I see her as like a mom to me. I don't know if I'd date a girl, although I made our with one once years ago, it didn't go very far because it felt unsatisfying.

I think it's just the vibe that I emanate to people. Because I'm an empath I can pick up on the moods of other people almost instantly (hasn't stopped me from making bad decisions or saying bad things - I can make mistakes often) and I notice that other people pick up on my vibe (which is very tied to my sexuality presence, by the way) and they either: a) come closer and engage with me on a sexual level, b) come closer and don't engage with me on a sexual level, c) notice when I'm sending out vibes that I are tied to my sexuality, then recoil when I try to get closer because they themselves are uncomfortable with their own sexuality, or d) recoil completely because my vibes are too much to handle and they don't want to give me ideas or they're scared of me.

Basically, I love and feel attraction for everyone (straights, trans, gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, queers) the last real relationship I was in I felt was love, despite being stifling, and since my breakup with him, which I predicted almost a year into our relationship, I've been struggling just to figure out who I am since then, have alienated almost everyone I know in the process. I would be talking to a counsellor instead of being on reddit, but I can't take advantage of that yet because school benefits don't start for me until September.

As I write this I don't feel comfortable knowing other people will eventually read it, and I don't want to make any conclusive statements, but I need structure in my life, I need to assert my identity, and I'm tired of feeling like I can't connect with people who understand, or better yet, with people who don't understand but who I can still connect with anyways.

Also, I need help finding a way to reign in my sexuality as this has got me into a lot of trouble. I try to please everyone on a social level and this has been taken advantage of many times. I was molested once when I was in grade six, basically scaring me away from sex until I was in university. I was raped when I was 21 because I didn't know what ""alarm bells"" were and what they meant until after the fact. Both these, and plenty other unsavoury sexual experiences were a result of me not being able to say no. Oh, did I mention my dad passed away when I was 16? That's OK, I've made peace with it, might be a moot point, but I feel it's significant in who I am at this point.

I think that being my ""flaming"" self makes others uncomfortable, and I don't want to do that, but I need to be comfortable in my own skin. Basically I need to learn how to pull my sex energy back because I've only just realised that I send signals out to people all the time, and I want to have some control in how others perceive me.

I think this is a stepping stone that I can place which will help me be more fluid and comfortable in my interactions with others and I can't reason it out myself because I don't know what I'm doing. I wish I was like those other people who can separate their mind from their heart, but I'm hopelessly emotional, and I can't think properly when my emotions are out of proportion.

I want this to be a step forward for myself, but I'm feeling so lost and need guidance from people who have a good grasp on sexuality and relationships to make an informed decision in owning myself and being good to others.

Carrying this ambiguity of being constantly judged is worse than I've ever done to anyone and I want to overcome it and find people who are on my side so I can move on and be with who I'm meant to be with and be who I'm meant to be.
Looking for: wisdom, practicality and sincerity.

Hello... New biguy here and looking for solid advice on how to start first encounter with another guy.,"Hi Everyone. I'll keep this short. I am a 27yo male from Western Europe and have come to the United States for work. I feel like it is more difficult to experiment and be myself here.
 
According to the kinsey scale I am mostly straight and lean into being bicurious. I already knew this and it is nothing new.

What I want advice in is that I am looking to take the plunge with another guy? I don't really know where to start as bisexual men are a minority and hard to find. I signed up for grindr but I dont know if being bicurious turns gays off and I dont want my first time to be with a stranger/ someone on a hook up site like grindr.

Is there a website for us? My bi friend told me it would be preferable to be with a biguy or married man in the closet as statistically they are less likely to carry STIs. Also, I don't want to ""come out"" or any of that. I am happy being straight and being perceived as such. I am happy who I am and my sexual curiosities are no ones business outside of my private life.

Any questions just ask!!

Coming out to family; I tried coming out as bi in the past - help please?,"Hello all! As the title reads, I tried to come out as bi to my family after some experimentation while away at college. They thought that it was just a phase, and I pretended to be ""disgusted"" by sexual activities with another male (This is half true because I wasn't attracted to the person I messed around with - I was more concerned with trying it out). Now I have a few years of thinking and experiences which led up to me discovering that I'm actually pan. I still live with my family so I want to be able to be myself with them. I'm starting to become depressed because of my repression. 

My questions are:

How should I go about coming out and make it believable/taken seriously?

Should I try and explain everything to put it into perspective for them?

What other advice do you have for me?

Thanks in advance for the help!  :)

UPDATE:
I came out to my mom today and she said that our family will love me and accept me anyway that I am.

how to explain pansexuality to others?,"hey, friendly neighborhood pan here! 

So even though most of my close friends know I'm pan, I still publicly ID as bi even though it is not my actual sexuality. I do this because it's really difficult for me to explain pansexuality to people who have never heard of it. I'm not good at dealing with the usual ""Isn't that just bi?"", etc.

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new here.

I'm a 25-year-old male that finalized my divorce to my wife a few months ago. She told me three years into our marriage that she was bisexual, and that got me thinking about my own sexuality.  Given that I lived in Alabama for most of my life (I am now in Denver) I have never been in a homosexual relationship. However, I am definitely interested, and I have been thinking about it more and more. 

Anyway, I've told my mom, and she has been really supportive (She said she didn't think she'd have to go into girl stuff because she had all boys, but aside from the occasional ribbing, she has been wonderful about it) but there is something I have been worried about, and I'm not sure if I should even do it.

I have had a crush on my best friend for as long as I can remember (but it wasn't sexual. He's like a brother to me, but I get that feeling in my stomach whenever I get to see him), but I don't want him to freak out about it. I would much rather keep my sexuality private, especially because I don't see him in a sexual manner. I'm just afraid if I told him my orientation, that he wouldn't want to be my friend anymore. 

I know this is probably trivial, but it's been eating at me for a while now, and I just don't know what I should do. For some reason, I feel like he should know, but I don't know if I should tell him. 

Anyway, thanks for reading, and I'm glad to have found this subreddit. It seems nice. ^^",pansexual

Hi. Coming out as bigender and pansexual. Help needed.," Well, I'm in a strange position of being in a triad (with two other bio males), 32 years old and finally being able to identify as bigender, pansexual and submissive. 

I know one of the definite reasons that it took me so long is the abuse of women I have witnessed, the sexual abuse that my female family members have went through and sexual shaming and threats of being disowned if I ever got a girl pregnant. This led to an extreme fear of hurting people, especially women and children (I was physically and mentally abused). This also led to a fear of harming people smaller than me which led to a LOT of body image issues and anxiety since I'm 6'4"".

It's endlessly complicated. LOL

In any event, I am still terrified of getting a woman pregnant but strongly desire unprotected sex with a woman. Preferrably I would be totally submissive. I'd pamper her (massage, cooking, etc.) and sexually please her until I earned my reward. But that's a big overblown fantasy that would probably make me have a panic attack if it just plopped into my lap today.

Anyway, guess I'm just looking for validation and advice. I'm interested in trans individuals as well but I'm not sure how to approach them either.

Is there any point in trying anymore...,"Hey everyone. This is my well technically first time posting something on reddit. I just want to share experience and I don't really know how to start this or know if I should post this but here goes I guess...

I'm pansexual (already out, my mother and my sister knows but my dad doesnt and I don't really go around telling people I'm pansexual unless they ask me about it), brown asian male (Thai) , 18 years old living in New Zealand. I've always known that I was different from everyone else ever since I was little where usually I never cared about genders or looks or anything and I feel very blind when it comes to liking people mainly other guys. 18 years of my life I've only ever had 3 people that I've really really liked and it just started last year right after I turned 17. I've never been in a relationship or really wanted one (mainly because no one has ever really liked me before in my whole life and I'm not gonna lie, I'm not the best looking guy out there and personally I think I'm like really below average when it comes to looks which could explain why) but this new guy came to my school and he turned my life upside down but he was fully straight so it really crushed me and confessing helped. To be honest I still really like him a lot even now but not seeing him anymore since I'm in University or College but I still get random pulses of feelings of him which still crushes me every time. This guy was my first crush ever and like the word crush, it crushed me. My 2nd crush was one of my female friend who happens to be pansexual as well but again it crushed me because she was already taken by my other friend who I'm close with so I couldn't do anything. These two crushes happened during highschool which was in my last year or grade there.

My 3rd who is also a guy that I met at my halls of residence and he happens to live right across my room. During the break before university started, I went back to Thailand and I arrived quite late so I missed orientation week and a few days of staying in my halls of residence after I have arrived, he introduced himself to me and we got to talk quite a bit and started hanging out. I felt like he was giving me mixed signals because every time I turn to him I'd end up catching him looking at me and smiling while looking away and because of the type of person he was (he was very sweet and genuine and I'm a sucker for genuine people because I'm genuine myself and usually when I say something, I really mean it and I don't act fake like a lot of people do. I'm not trying to be arrogant or anything I promise. I just speak my mind quite a bit when it doesn't affect anyone badly or at all and usually when I see a chance, I go for it immediately), I immediately fell for him almost like how I fell for my first crush and when I asked him out, again, I was crushed to pieces because he was straight and because I've never been liked by anyone before in my entire life, I didn't know any signs or anything.

Also this next part kinda relates to the first part but umm yeah sorry I don't really know how to do these things or reach out to people or anything at all... 

So when I was little I've never been really popular or anything and making friends was kind of hard and it still is because I have huge trust issues and I think I read the lines wrong when it comes to people who are just friendly and people who genuinely want to get to know me. So yeah, ever since I  was little, I would move schools or towns quite a lot and when I was about 6, I moved to New Zealand from Thailand and during my 5 year stay in New Zealand, I've moved schools 3 times (technically its two schools since I had trouble with an inexperienced teacher in year 5 at my 2nd school which resulted in me being expelled and I moved back to the first school) and houses 4 times which was why I never really had any close friends that lasted more than a year or two due to constantly moving and another reason is that whenever I try reach out to people, I get rejected immediately or no one approaches me and to be honest I don't know what I'm doing wrong and when people don't push me away, I end up becoming the ""pet"" of the group where I'd do anything it takes just to make them like me which lead to me having trust issues because after I turned 14 (however I started becoming aware of my sexuality when I was about 7 or 8 even though I started puberty at 10), I realized that no one liked me for who I was and only pretended to like me so that they could use me but when I wasn't around anymore, the people I thought I was friends with just threw me out like I was yesterday's garbage and because of this very reason, I ended up having trust issues and I started to push people away if someone tried to get close or I just end up being alone. I know being a lonewolf isn't necessarily a bad thing and at most times I enjoy it but then sometimes I end up feeling just completely broken and like the walls that I put up to hide my true feelings was smashed to pieces and I end up having a meltdown in my room from time to time.

If you are still reading this, thank you so much for putting up with someone like me and if not I'm terribly sorry you had to waste your time again on someone like me.

Anyways so yeah. I really don't know what to do at all. All my life, I've been treated like unwanted trash. I've never truly experienced what it's like to be wanted by anyone apart from my family but family's different. I've never been liked by anyone and usually people just ignore me. I'm not socially awkward, maybe a bit shy due to insecurities and I get along with people just fine. A lot of people I've talked to tells me that I dress very nicely, very clean and well groomed and I don't smell and also that I'm a likable guy, that I'm sweet, genuine or funny, something along those lines but I personally think they're just being nice because if I truly was what they say I am then I wouldn't be treated like I am everyday where people just pretend I don't exist, and also the fact that I'm fugly already guarantees the chances of that happening already. Don't tell me that appearance doesn't mean anything because it does and even though the majority of the people here including me are pansexual, we wouldn't even know about a person's personality until we approach them and let's face it, if there was 2 other people trapped in a room with you, one with a not so friendly appearance and isn't very attractive but is the nicest and most wonderful person in the world while the other person is very attractive and looks very friendly but has the bitchiest and worst personality in the world, naturally we would approach the attractive person first because we wouldn't know what kind of person that person actually was until we approached her and the only reason why we actually did was because that person looked trustworthy and attractive and if anyone says that they'd approach the ugly person instead of the attractive person, you're just lying to yourself, and I believe that's what people think of me. Appearance is the first and most important thing in getting anyone interested in anyone or anything and since my case is people treating me like this because of my appearance, is there really any reason or point in my trying anymore?

Again... Thank you so much for people who read from the start til the end and I'm terribly sorry for the long post but I'm not good with expressing my feelings because I've never had anyone to express it to before.",pansexual
Lost my gay virginity!!!! Have you? Share your story,"(Excluding ages and grade) There's this guy whom apparently is gay (And is actually named Gabriel like myself), though he‚Äôs not really effeminate he‚Äôs just fun and playful, and I've been attracted to him for about a year now, it‚Äôs like I'm gay just for him man, I have never had feelings like this for any guy whatsoever, so about two weeks ago he was looking at me weird while we were eating at our table during lunch, there were about 8 to 9 people on the table which are basically my group of friends, and I had this weird boner man, just because he was looking at me then I looked back and he just raised his left eyebrow and continued playing SMITE, the next day basically the same thing happened and he started rubbing his leg on mine, nobody noticed but it was like my dick was on steroids cx, on Monday, first day of finals (I live in Puerto Rico, our school years go from August to December and from January to May) the hole group decided to go to the movies to see MAD MAX (which is great btw). We all went on my van (I have a 1966 Volkswagen Type 2 Kombi), so we finished the movie we headed to the mall's Sbarro and we ordered like 3 pizzas, then we just roamed around the mall and Gabriel stopped in Starbucks Cafe to buy a latte or something, we just said we'd wait for him on the Microsoft Store (which was downstairs) so we're heading down the escalator and I have this sudden urge to pee (so I tell the guys I'll go to the bathroom)... I come out and as I'm heading for MSS there's Gabriel, we get together and head to MSS but none of my friends are there, so I started texting one of them but she didn't answer, then we headed for GameStop because we thought that's where they'd be and we just started talking while on our way, we started joking around and then he poked my nose, then about 30 seconds later we were just poking fighting and so I grabbed him from behind and started poking his belly and tickling him. We landed against one of the huge touch pad maps for the mall. He got all giggly and I was so nervous because I had the biggest fucking boner of my life, we sort of held each other and he pressed himself against it, and gave me that left eyebrow again and I literally fucking lost it so I started cringing, like 11 seconds in I went like fuck it, and fucking kissed the fuck out of him, so he pulls back and says ""The van?"" to which I replied ""Yeah, the van!"" and we walked rather fast to the Parking lot, we head to the van and I open the side door, and leaned the back seat completely to the back so it felt like a bed (Backseat did not belong to the van, we added it). So he just sits in the back while I turn on the van for the air conditioning (also added its one of those sparse ones so we have AC ventilation holes and in some key points of the van), turned on the lights and pulled down all the front and side curtains, I turned back and started getting close to him and we were like 3 inches away from each other so I grabbed his legs and pulled them up as he leaned back, and I leaned on top. He was wearing really tight red shinnies (I guess that's how you write that) I started unbuckling his belt and jeans while we were making out and slowly grabbed them and gently pulled them up with his underwear until they were completely off to his ankles, I've always thought he'd have a big one but it was about 5 inches erected, but it was so clean and shaved, my face immediately went ^~^, he was wearing a grey hoodie and he was playfully covering himself with it, so then he sat and started unbuckling me, while looking at me with those green eyes of his. I've always shaved everything like really well, which is why i found that he shaved as much as me pretty awesome, guess he felt the same way, he looked so stoked, I'm about 7 1/2 inches erected, I mean it‚Äôs not that awesome but I'm proud Ig cx, he started rubbing it while licking me from bottom to top, you see I'm not the worst looking guy eve, but my Addams apple is abnormally big which is why I've only had two girlfriends in my whole life, but this was the best blowjob I've ever had, while he deep-throat it he wiggled his tongue around at the same time and it was amazing, I couldn't help it and I came like 8 minutes in and he looked so surprised, some creeped out his mouth, but then he just cringed, went down and swallowed it, since I got off I laid him down and started giving him a handjob and tried to blow him as well as he did, trying to copy him and whatnot but not for so long, so I saddled on top of him and he knocked me down to the side and put my feet on his shoulders, and rubbed his dick against mine, he reached for his back pack and pulled some lube I assume and he smeared it all over his dick and mine then he rubbed some on me toot cx,  so we started doing anal, well I received, he did it so calmly and passionately though, it felt amazing, about 20 minutes and some different positions later he felt he was going to cum so he pulled out lifted his dick and tried to catch it with his mouth as it just blasted upwards, I grabbed him and put him on the seat and licked the cum from the top of his hoodie, neck and face and I put it in his mouth while kissing, I mean I didn‚Äôt spit it in, it was more like letting it slide in I guess, He asked if I had done this before, which was literally the first word either of us said up to this point, I said that it was my first time with a guy, He looked shocked and said ‚Äúnice‚Äù with the weirdest fucking cringe ever,  so he started jacking me again and once I was completely erected he rubbed more lube on me and turned around and positioned himself like so: http://viralplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/anal-turtle.jpg (picture) (Which btw, never did I imaging could be so sexy) just putting my hands on his ass and neck, without even thinking about it I scraped most of the lube off and just went in without any second thought, basically the opposite of the sweetness that he used, It was like I wasn‚Äôt even thinking of how it might hurt him or if he felt pain I just rammed the fuck out of him. He kept moaning while making this really sexy giggle I swear I was in there for like 25 to 30 minutes. Basically the same as before but he was the bottom, when I was about to cum I told him that I was gonna pull out but he insisted I kept going, at this point we were laying on our sides and I came inside of him, after like 40 seconds of giggling I took it out and he turned to me and we just laid there for about an hour kissing handling each others dick and talking, I put his boxers on and he wore mine, just because, and I gave him a ride to his house, then I drove back to mine and shortly after I realized that I had left the rest of my friends at the mall‚Ä¶ for the other two days we made out at certain points, he‚Äôd grab my crotch whenever I walked pass him when none were watching, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever do this with another guy, so idk it was something special and I think I really like him.

variations on pansexuality?,"I'm conflicted over whether or not to identify as ""pansexual."" 

I relate to the first part of the definition on this page: the ""potential for sexual attractions, sexual desire, or romantic love, towards people of all gender identities and biological sexes.""

But when the definition goes on to say that gender may be ""insignificant or irrelevant,"" I have second thoughts.

It seems to me those are two different things -- either you're open to relationships with all genders and there are specific things you are drawn to about those genders, OR, you find gender irrelevant and, as I've heard some people phrase it, don't worry about ""what's between a person's legs.""

The second concept (being gender-blind) reminds me of this sarcastic response: ""Thank you for seeing past the aspect of my personality that I fought for decades to legitimate.""
(http://daniellelavigne.com/post/102556610078/gender-blind-made-as-a-critical-response-to-a)

I understand that a term like this can encompass multiple definitions, and I think that in general the term is the closest to my orientation that I've come across yet. But if I identify with a particular label only for people to Google it and find definitions that don't accurately represent my orientation ... that doesn't really help.

[Question] Should my parents know if I am pan? Is it their right as my parents to know?,"My parents aren't super conservative, but I know things would change if they knew.

I don't know about my brother, I know things would change. We are really close, and I don't want to ruin our friendship. What if I wanted to date someone who isn't a guy, though? Would it be best to tell them, rather than surprise them? ""Hi mom, hi dad. This is my gf and oh yeah, I pansexual."" My brother doesn't believe in pansexuality and says it's the same as bi.

Confused and just need to vent a tiny bit?,"I'm a 17 yr old female, and I've identified as pansexual for almost a year. I've found this label to best describe me right now, but I'm still figuring stuff out :) Basically I've only ever been with males, and my relationships tend to last longer than usual (at least for a teenager lol), which is not always a good thing because they drag on and I'm bad at emotions. I have a boyfriend right now, still a relatively new relationship, and I'm pretty happy. The problem is that I've recently had bigger eyes for women, and I always have been attracted to women but it's more so this time. Nothing personal against my bf of course, but I tend to find boys bland and unattractive, while women are like WOW... hello.... not only physically but personality wise as well. I don't really find my bf physically attractive either? It sounds strange to say to myself but I'm not super attracted to him, its mostly a romantic thing.

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not really sure what question I'm asking here or if I'm asking one at all. Just another confused hormonal teenager here.

Homecoming! Not like high school.,"I have very recently come across the term pansexual! It felt like I was finally reading a description about myself that I did not need to edit or add to or qualify.

Thread for pansexuals who've only dated one person/gender,"So, I've only ever dated one person in my entire life, who happens to be male.  I'm female.  It's because of this that I was very hesitant about figuring out my sexuality and coming out.  At first, I figured it didn't matter whether or not I liked other genders because I was (and still am) hoping to be with this man forever.  I also worried that people would accuse me of making it up to be included (most of my friends are lgbt).  I spent a year or so with this mentality, until one night when I was looking up pansexuality and felt so excited and identified with it so much that I couldn't hold it in any more.  It was part of me, and I wanted the world to know, even if it changed nothing about my love life.

However, I've still only been with one person, and that makes it weird sometimes.  I actually had a friend actively argue with ME over MY sexuality (""What do you mean?  You're straight.""  ""No, I'm pan.""  ""No, you're straight."")  I had to explain to him that heterosexual relationships did not equal heterosexual people, and the whole thing was really weird.

I also feel a little weird when I go to LGBT-related events, like when I went to my local city's pride parade this past summer.  I wore a pansexual-themed t-shirt that I created and I tried to include myself in things, but I don't really feel like I completely have the right to be included.  I've never dated a woman or trans person, so I've never had to deal with the abuse and harassment that most of the lgbt population has seen, I don't have to worry about laws preventing me from marrying my boyfriend, etc.  I'm not saying I want those horrible things to happen to me, either.  I'm just saying I never know if it's entirely appropriate to include myself or not.

Am I pansexual or straight?,"I'm the type of person that doesn't fall for people very quickly, rarely gets crushes/feelings for anyone. The thing that does get my attention is if the person and I connect on an intellectual level. Someone that has an open mind and my sense of humor. 

I would date any person of any gender if we had that connection(at least, I'd like to think so...) 

The thing is, the only people that I check out are men, only think about men and penises. If I see a ""cute girl"" I would say she's pretty, but wouldn't be attracted to her. Same with other genders. The only reason I'm debating this is because I can see myself dating all genders, but I might see it as an exception, maybe?
Only because I don't connect with people on that level very often and if I did find someone that I connected with, I'd most likely fall for them.

Who among us expected the lull after the storm of coming to terms with your sexuality? (If such had been the case for you),"I've always thought that the lack of content on /r/pansexual (and even /r/bisexual) to be somewhat unusual.

In my case, I remember living through years of internal strife in order to get to where I am now. Of going alone through the process of learning that some things you have to learn by yourself and ignore the presumptuous world around you, and feeling ungrounded about it the whole time.

But then as the storm abated, the waters lowered and stilled, and the uneventfulness of it just seemed surprising, unmatched to the flurry that brought me here.

I am pansexual, and that's it. It's naturally and comfortably me, and I rarely feel the need to discuss it except as a yearning for others to share my point of view so that they too might in the joy and freedom I feel over the comparative constraint one might feel others have. Otherwise it's just natural and uneventful, and I almost feel disappointed about it.

The only thing I can rationalize to explain this is that the state of pansexuality is a kind of evolutionary threshold that solves many of the problems that came before it. It's a plateau of gentle ease, and the only meaning I can derive from the preceding storm is that it was wholly unnecessary. I've read many of your stories about how it came so naturally to many of you during and even before puberty, and aside from an absence of outside confirmation until you were old enough to decide for yourself, the only problems came from those around you who hadn't readily accepted your sexuality.

I can't help but imagine what a society, unconstrained by discriminative sexualities, might be. (fine print: I am not equating non-pansexuals with the practices of oppressive discrimination. It's just a good term to accurate describe a particular thought. The idea of discrimination is not inherently oppressive. There's nothing immoral about discriminating against broccoli, or the smell of sewage, or paper cuts, for example.)

It feels very hard to accept myself,"I am afab nonbinary, sometimes I feel like a nonbinary girl. But in this scenario I thought I was a cis girl.

I know I am pansexual, I self identified this way when I was 12 but no one knew what I was talking about, so I came out as bi to most of my friends. One friend who I thought was a best friend began to avoid me and act passive agressive towards me. I asked another friend why passive friend was acting this way and she told me that passive friend thought that me expressing attraction towards girls in magazines or irl was me being attention seeking about being bisexual. I was shocked, hurt and confused. I did the same thing with my other straight friends who would be like ""yeah! she's cute!"" so I didn't understand why this was a problem. I felt ashamed and I never made up with that friend.

This, along with other things that have happened in my life like sexual trauma and internalised misogyny have made it very hard for me to accept my attraction to girls or feminine people. I feel as though I'm objectifying them and their bodies, and I feel disgusted with myself.

Just wanted to share because I'm really struggling with this right now.

confusing sexual identity -_-,"Still not entirely sure what I would call myself, but my sexuality is DEFINITELY fluid. My attraction is usually towards cis-women (hetero), but also a lot of times toward t-women as well. However, I've never really found a particular attraction to t-men. Although I don't actually feel attracted to males per se (i.e. If I am in a crowd of people, I have a tendency to just check out girls, I never look at guys) but at the same time, I have a lot of gay fantasies and have hooked up with guys before. However, there are some men where I can say to myself ""wow he's pretty cute!"" And in addition, I am very picky about guys who I would hook up with, FAR more picky than if I was with a woman. Out of 3 sexual encounters I've had with guys, I've only enjoyed 1 and was grossed out by the other 2. Of the one sexual encounter i had with a t-girl, that was my favorite.

The thing is, I definitely go through different periods. Most of the time I'm just attracted to girls in general (trans or cis, but mostly cis), sometimes I will just have homoerotic fantasies instead and prefer to be with a man. Or sometimes, it will be any combination of those three sexualities. It definitely gets confusing at times, but even more so frustrating because I have a girlfriend (cis) and sometimes I just feel like I'm not as sexually into her as I am other times. Sometimes I just really want to experiment outside the relationship but she isn't okay with that so it leaves me seriously conflicted at times. But I love her very much, so I wouldn't just leave her.

Just wanted to know if there is anyone else out there like me, though granted as we understand how complex and unique sexuality can be, I wouldn't be surprised if there are very, very few. And I know maybe this isn't strictly pansexual since I am obviously not gender-blind, but it's the closest thing I can find where people understand sexuality in a much more complex way than gay/straight/bisexual.",pansexual

Today we had seen the movie ""Pride"" and I mentioned that it completely glossed over the notion of Bisexual or Pansexual people and that I felt that was a big oversight in a film celebrating LGBT rights and acceptance. 
He didn't seem to think that this was a big oversight and I let it go because I didn't feel it was worth a debate, so, whatever I guess. 

 BUT then out of nowhere he says, ""You know, you're so lucky you're bi, because when you go out to a pub, you're guaranteed to find someone to go home with."" and I basically said, ""Uh, nope, that's not how it works"" and his response was basically, ""well if you can't find a guy to get with, you can look for a girl, so you basically have a guarantee of getting laid.""

Two things bothered me about this, firstly, ""Bi/pan people are greedy"" and secondly, a film celebrating LGBT rights completely glossing over bisexuality/pansexuality.

Figuring out who you are.,"Since I was young I always found myself looking at boys and girls. I liked them both and I had crushes on both and I never had a second thought about it. As I grew up I went through a phase where I didn't crush on anyone, but as I got into middle school and high school I started liking boys. I saw nothing wrong with that and knew it was just me becoming a teenager and crushing. That was until I was fifteen and I met this girl in an after school club. I don't know why, but I became infatuated with her. She was pretty, smart, and so nice. It was strange to me because I felt this overwhelming need to get her to notice me and be friends with me and like me. I didn't know why I felt this way, but the more I looked into it the more I knew I had a crush on her. I didn't want to admit it though. I thought maybe it was a one time thing and I'd get over it. I eventually did, but I didn't get over girls. I still liked boys, but I liked girls too. After those years I swore off relationships and moved on focusing on school. As I got into my first year of college I started noticing these feelings for girls once more. I had dreams of being with other girls and to say the least I liked the idea. However, I didn't know what it was and I thought there was no way I could be gay. I was under the impression there was straight gay and nothing else. I tried so hard to ignore this feeling and convince myself I was straight. As time went on I began to accept that I liked girls. I came to terms with the fact I wouldn't mind if a girl asked me out as long as she was a nice person and I liked her. Same with boys I wouldn't mind if they asked me out either. This evolved into me saying that I don't care what my partner has in their pants I just want someone who loves me for me and will make me happy. I didn't care if they had a penis or a vagina and boob, if they were assigned male or female at birth, if they chose not to identify as either. It didn't matter to me at all. What mattered was the person inside. 
This brought me to a point where I knew that I wasn't necessarily straight, I knew I wasn't gay, but bisexual didn't seem to fit right with me. Of course with the help of the lovely internet I found out what pansexual is and that there are other people who are attracted to people in the same way I am, not caring about gender or gender identity or anything like that. Needless to say after finding this out I am a lot more accepting of myself.",pansexual

I Think I may have found what I am but.. There's always a but,"This is a very interesting and exciting time in my life, I am diving in and holding nothing back,

My whole life I have wondered what I am, recently I was telling my friend how I feel towards people and she said I was pan. So I of course went on line and researched exactly what pansexual was. It has honestly been the closest single word definition I have come across, but there's still something missing, and it scares me sometime, other times its exciting! its a hodge podge of emotions

So a little about myself and what I am.

I am attracted to everything, but not in the normal sense, I never understood catcalling, Porn never really worked for me. I could never just get aroused in public at the site of someone attractive even if they were completely my type. If I dont know them I cant be attracted to them. I have always been very numb to blind attraction,

However once I get to know someone I find interesting it usually takes about 2 dates or equal acceptable timing and I am fully attracted to them, and I mean full on ready to rumble.
Its never diminished over the length of a relationship, its like a switch, once its on it on
It takes pretty much the same amount of time to turn it off say it doesn't work out. 

For example. I am 24M 
I recently started seeing this really cute guy, we hit it off really quickly, I knew i was attracted to him the moment we met. However it wasn't until our 2nd date about half way through the date, I even remember what we were doing when the switch turned, I was fully attracted to him without any question. It was a really cool feeling and I was immediately excited, not horny just excited to feel the attraction kick in! The point is, I had to know him or at least get to know him before I could become attracted to him.

This has happened several different times with different partners. Gender means nothing to me, it is 100% the persons attitude and personality that allow me to be physically attracted to them. 

My question I guess is, am I Pansexual? Everything I have read has talked about blanket attraction without borders or being gender blind and such but my attraction isnt based on any kind of physical attributes, If I find someone attractive mentally then no matter what they look like physically I will be attracted. I either love it all or love nothing.

This is exciting and scary for me, im really sorry for formatting in advance

"I finally figured it out, and everything makes sense to me.","My main reason to post here is so I can meet others who share my view. Mostly because I don't know anyone who thinks/feels like this and it would be nice to. Here's the story.

Resent events have lead me to question my identity.. I always thought I was bisexual. It never truly made sense to me, but it was closer to the truth than heterosexual. Then I found the term pansexual. It describes how my attractions to people in general develop. I don't pay attention to gender, it has never been a huge factor to me. 

Main reason I came to this conclusion is because my partner is transitioning. People ask me why I am still with her even though she is no longer a male. I simply say because her personality is the same, and that is why I lover her. But it is so hard for some to understand. Even those who know I ID as bisexual question it. 

I hope that made sense.. Have a wonderful day everyone!

A really sweet story about my date two nights ago :),"Just as a heads up I mention **self-harm** in the post. It's literally just a mention of my scars but I thought I'd let you all know in case that bothers anyone.

So I've seen this really cute person a few times now. We hung out once and went to a GSA meeting where I ended up meeting a few old friends from high school who turned out to be queer, which was fun.

They saw my self-harm scars then and asked about them (in a really nice way, not an intrusive, rude way), but I didn't really know what to say so I didn't really give them an answer. It's pretty obvious in my opinion what they're from though. That, combined with my awkward non-answer was enough for them to guess I'm sure.

After that we had a few dates that ended with some awesome kissing (on the beach and on a harbor bridge!).

Anyway we were out the night before last, and I was driving and wearing a tank top (scars are on my right shoulder) so they were completely visible to them in the passenger seat. 

So we were at a stoplight and they literally just out of nowhere leaned over and kissed my scars. It was just a tiny little boop but christ I felt like I was melting inside.

I'm getting kinda teary-eyed writing this out right now too actually, it was just the sweetest thing anyone's ever done :)

I didn't know what to say or do, I wanted to drop everything and hug them really tight but since I was driving, I didn't think that was wise, heh. I'm definitely going to tell them how much it meant to me next time we hang out though.

Married and a little confused,I feel like pansexuality may describe me perfectly. I'm scared though because I'm married to a wonderful guy and I love him dearly.  We also have some adorable twins. But...  I feel like I fall in love with everyone. I will have an amazing conversation with someone and fall in love with them and daydream about them. I could accidentally touch someone and instantly see something in them I never saw before. This also makes me severely aroused to be around them. I feel like these feelings may one day hurt my family and I really don't want to do that.  This means old young fat skinny everyone...  I am a naturally flirty person and when I drink it's triple to quadruple fold.  I don't know how to approach this with my husband and I don't want it to ruin my relationship.  Does anyone have any tips and am I actually pansexual?,pansexual
Welp my GM found out I'm not straight,"I try my best to keep my personal life and work life separate. If people ask me about my sexuality I tell them but it's not like I go around telling everyone I'm not straight. Was talking to my GM today about a coworker we use to have that I never got along with. While this coworker and I didn't get along for many reasons one was because he overheard myself and another talking about how I'm into guys and girls and such. GM asks me about it since we were on the subject of said coworker. Apparently another coworker whom I've never told about my sexuality told our GM that I was bi. While I was tempted to correct her and say I was pan I decided to leave it be so I wouldn't have to explain what pansexual meant. While my GM didn't act weird or anything when I told her I wasn't straight still bugs me that she knows. I really just don't like my coworkers knowing much about my personal life because it's personal. Blah, my apologies for the random rant just annoyed slightly.",pansexual
So today I was tested.... (I think),"Last week, I finally came into finding my pansexual gender identity in which I celebrated with a friend over breakfast before telling her. She was pansexual too so she was happy for me and glad I found myself on my own identity without any influence on her part. Well today at work as we were going on lunch I had the usual funny argument with a guy that likes to start fights with me (I always win :P) but then as I go to my friend (who I came out to) she was standing next to my co-worker and i told them both I got into another argument with ""him"" again. She says laughing ""Why is it always the lesbians that like to pick on the gay guys."" Time seemed to slow down for a second when she said that because in my head I literally yelled ""I am not a lesbian bitch, I'm pansexual!"" (Sorry for bluntness I just want to say how it really happened) A week ago I would've found this completely funny and responded normally. 

In comparison to me finally accepting myself as pansexual, I've never come close to defending myself so strongly mentally when I identified as a lesbian. Do you think I was tested? and do you think how i reacted is normal? or have I not really accepted myself seeing as I said it mentally and not verbally?",pansexual
Im pretty sure...,"So if I can have sex with anyone, and I mean anyone, male in male body female in female body, male in female body, female in male body, fat skinny young old, attached, casual, or just a person to pass the afternoon with, I assume that means I'm pansexual right? Im still trying to figure out how to define the myriad of sexual emotions i feel towards people, and I thought maybe you guys could give me advice. I like girlish boys, and boyish girls, and ultra feminine girls and super masculine guys, and basically anyone under the sun besides children (never could understand the attraction) and just want to make love to everyone.

Pansexuality isn't a well defined term‚Ä¶ from my point if view.,"I've noticed that many people in the pansexual community disagree on the various ""requirements"" of being pansexual.

However, I am sexually attracted to all genders. Could use some sage advice. ",pansexual
"Yay, alternate religion AND sexuality to come out as!","So, I have a bit of a dilemma. I'm in a very Irish Catholic family, and I happen to be a pansexual laveyan Satanist. Now, my family isn't likely to react well to either of those things, so I'm turning to the internet for advice. Should I come out about both all at once and just get past all the fallout as quickly as possible? Should I instead do one then the other? If so, which should I bring up first, and how long should I wait before I bring up the other? I realize I'm probably being needy, asking for advice from people with no idea what my life is like in detail, but I've been going through a lot lately, and my judgement hasn't been very good.",pansexual
Deciphering Pansexuality (X-Post from LGBT),"I've long identified myself as a bisexual. I didn't know what pansexual really meant. I have aways been open to all genders and types of people, and I realize now that I'm not bisexual because I'm not limited to attraction/loving just the male and female gender. I knew a long time ago that there were more than two genders but it's taken me this long to connect that with being pansexual (info. can be sparse).

Can other pansexuals confirm that I'm getting this correctly?

Pansexual and/or Bisexual,"Hi 

So I consider myself both Pansexual and Bisexual and I was just curious if of the people here in /r/pansexual, how many out you exclusively use the term pansexual and how many of you would also use the term bisexual.
If you use both terms, what is your reasoning for using both. I genuinely am interested in this and would like to know your opinions. 

I'm also a youtuber and have done a video on the topic (http://youtu.be/osZxrqBJuSQ) while the responses have been good, it hasn't quite scratch the itch I have for people opinions.

So it would be great if you would let me know your opinions in this area, do you use both labels? if so what is your reasoning for using both? and if not do you think its bad for someone to use both labels?",pansexual

Need advice :&lt;,"Hello everyone

(I don't know if this is the right place to post this but here goes)

So yeah I'm pansexual and I've just found out that title that describes me best about 2 years ago because I always thought that bisexuality just didn't fit me because I've never really cared about whether the person is male or female or what he/she looks but what I cared most was how he/she treated me and other people etc.? Anyways so I'm not really open about my sexuality or myself and only a few people I really trust (I find it really difficult to truly trust anyone so when I say people I trust, I mean the people that I would gladly take a bullet for because those people mean a lot to me and I feel completely comfortable with them with anything really) knows that I am pansexual but I don't have a problem with telling people that I am pansexual if they directly ask me. Anyways I'm a 17 year old male and I just had my first ever crush. Yes I am serious. I personally hate the idea of having a relationship and I don't really end up liking anyone at all but when I first saw my crush, my heart started beating really fast when he's around and I enjoy that feeling but my problem is that my crush is a STRAIGHT male... The problem with that is he's very straight and possibly homophobic and I'm not really friends with him so I don't really know much about him. I know it's ridiculous, the fact that I don't know anything about him yet I find him to be very nice, gentleman like and when he's within my ""radius"" xD, it just feels really nice and I just can't help but secretly look at him and admire him... 
This is honestly making it really hard for me because I cant stop thinking about him at all even though I know that, one I don't have a chance at all because like I said he seems to be very very straight and possibly be homophobic and two, he's out of my league... Like 100 times out of my league, that's just how it feels and if somehow he ends up being bi or bi-curious which will never happen anyways, I still won't have a chance xD

So yeah... How do I keep him off my mind? It's been almost 4 months since I started crushing on him and friends and other places like youtube etc. always say to ""keep your mind busy by doing activities, reading books or playing games etc what ever you enjoy"" which does not seem to work at all and the crushing slowly making me go crazy since after I've finished reading my book or doing work or school work he just pops directly back in my mind again.

Letter to the SJWs,"Stop nitpicking. Honestly. Pansexuality is one of the most free and open sexualities in the world. Chances are there are VERY few people with any sort of gender prejudice in our community. If we say we're pan cause we're into (insert general non-cisgender label here) we are NOT saying that we believe that person is not a man or a woman. We are saying we have no problems with any sort of transgender person. Binary or non-binary. Do not call me a cissexist again or I will have MANY colorful words for you.

Just found this subreddit.,"I was going through random reddits and eventually thought to myself ""hmmm, I wonder if there's a reddit for pansexuals"" and there you guys were. I immediately felt like I was home. I read through the side bar and some of your posts before subscribing. 

I come from a tiny town that the slightly larger towns all around it haven't even heard of. The kind of place where anything different is beaten down and anything unheard of is usually likened to devil worship. I figured out I liked both males and females when I was in elementary school, though at that point I hadn't even heard of the term bisexual, let alone pansexual. 

By middle school I started becoming a little more comfortable with my sexuality, though I still didn't talk to anyone about it. In high school I began to get more curious about gender and sexuality and by my senior year I finally heard the term pansexual. I still told people I knew in person who I trusted that I was bisexual and began exploring this new identity online. The only thing I really found was ""Ew, don't tell people things like that"" or ""So....you like pans?"". 

I feel like I've had to hide this part of myself my entire life. Its just nice to find a place where I can feel accepted. The city I live in now (only 30 minute drive from where I grew up) is having a pride festival in October. I'm excited to go and hopefully finally feel comfortable enough to tell the world who I am.

"New sub, my story (Wall of text) and a rant/question to top it off","hello everyone. this is my first post so excuse any mistakes or incorrect language, just thought i'd introduce myself and share my story, F(20) .

i understood i was different from an early age (around 5) i was watching TV an noticed women provocatively dancing and suddenly realized i had feelings that 5 year old girls aren't meant to have towards other girls but for boys, which coming from a very religious background (dad was training to be a vicar) i buried deep in my subconscious  and didn't think about till i was 8 and meet a girl in real life who i had feelings for, by then i thought i was a lesbian and totally terrified of this revelation ignored any feelings i had for anyone, i went most of my school life not dating, basically condemning myself to a life of asexuality (if i couldn't be 'normal' then i didn't deserve love)  sure there was the odd guy here and a few drunken kisses at parties with both genders but it wasn't till i was 14 and meet a guy that i realized i could have feelings for both genders, but it didn't stop there, the boy was bi and opened my eyes to the whole LGBT community and i honestly thought i had landed in heaven, i came to terms with the fact it was possibly and okay to like guys and girls and then one final revelation happened, i had a thing for trans people, along the lines of ' if they were a sweet and kind person with kind eyes i just couldn't help myself', it was like my sexual mind was finally open and i couldn't get enough so like a selfish kid in a candy store i wanted everything and anything.

i happily drifted around in non committed circles going for who ever made me smile or was just up for a bit of fun but i hadn't fallen in love at all, sure i had had crushes but not dated anyone ever. then i meet my bf at the time we were 16 both not 100% straight and both ready to dive into what ever life had to offer, 4 years on we're still dating, which leads me to my rant.

im a pansexual girl dating a bisexual guy and all my friends just think im strait and putting a fancy name to it, which hurts because i've explored so much into my sexuality and its take so much time for me to come to terms with who i am that when close friends think its a 'phase' or a 'joke' i get a little defensive, my question is how can i get my friends to understand my sexuality without coming across as some sort of sexual hipster??

"Identifying as ""gay"", ""lesbian"", or other typically-homosexual terms","Hey pansexual pals, I wanted to ask around and get a consensus of what you other pans think about being identified by typical ""homosexual"" terms. When I'm around my other LGBTQ friends, and even around some people in general, sometimes I find myself being identified as a ""lesbian"" even though this really isn't 100% true. I mean, I accept it, because I honestly relate well to a lot of ""lesbian"" things and watch ""lesbian"" films, etc, etc, but it really creates confusion sometimes when I tell a guy I like him and he goes, ""But aren't you into chicks?""

So how do you guys feel about this?

Confused...,"  So, some of this might sound a little odd and maybe won't make much sense (it's early in the morning and I should really be asleep), but I am genuinely curious and didn't know who else to turn to. This has bothered me for a while.... I just stumbled upon this subreddit and feel like I need to get this off my chest.... Let me explain:

  About a year ago I realized that I'm bisexual. Most likely. I mean, I'm definitely attracted to girls, although I've never actually been with a girl. Only guys. Recently, I realized that I also find some transgendered people attractive, too. (Side note: I've always noticed that no matter how attractive the person is or what they look like, if they have a bad personality then they are absolutely unattractive to me. I'm really mostly attracted to a person's personality, and I've been that way my entire life.) I haven't found a sex or gender that I'm not attracted to, really. I think I might be mostly attracted to men... but, then again, I've only ever been with men.... Maybe that's just bias/confusion from only having been with men?
  I've had crushes on girls that I've been around (nothing too serious, since I'm currently in a very committed and loving   relationship) but i've never actually been around a transgendered person before; I've only seen interviews, or pictures, or porn. I guess I'm wondering if it's possible that maybe just the porn alone turns me on? In other words... I've heard of straight women liking lesbian porn and straight men liking transgender porn, so maybe I just like watching the porn but wouldn't actually be attracted to someone that's transgendered?? I really don't think that's what it is though.... But how can I be sure? Maybe I'm just second guessing too much or overthinking the issue.
  I used to identify with being straight (mostly due to my extreme sheltered and Christian upbringing), but I've always known deep down that I'm definitely not straight. So..... What am I? Has anyone else dealt with this specifically?
Any advice? Questions? Tips? How/when did some of you first realize that you're pan sexual? Is there anything you can tell me or advise me about? Should I really worry about a 'title' this much? I really hate not knowing and saying that I'm bi when, in all honesty, I don't know what I truly am. It's just doesn't feel right.",pansexual

Need some advice on coming out to my girlfriend,"This is a throwaway account. I am a mid twenties male, and since puberty I've known that I don't just fancy girls. I experimented with a couple of guys when I was younger, and I've identified as pansexual since I was about 16/17. The people that I have fallen in love with in the past have all been girls, some who I have told about myself and some who I haven't. 

The girl I am currently with, I have been with 4 years and I plan to spend the rest of my life with. I've never cheated on her and I never intend on doing so. She's my best friend, and we have an emotional and sexual connection that I have never had with anybody else. Sounds pretty straight forward, right? 

Right at the start of us going out, we got drunk one night and I told her everything. I told her I am pansexual, and for me that means that I'm not attracted to guys AND girls, but just people, regardless of parts. I don't really remember the conversation, but I couldn't stay the night because I was going to watch a friend's DJ set later. The next morning I found some texts on my phone drunkenly saying that I have a hall pass, and I can sleep with as many guys as I want. Obviously I hadn't taken her up on it, but I could tell from the text that she was a bit freaked out. So that morning, absolutely hanging, I went to hers for breakfast, and I brought up the subject of the texts. Literally as soon I mentioned them, she said she had deleted the texts and asked if we could not speak about them, as she was embarrassed. I know I should have asked how she felt about what I told her, but I was crazy about her, and my thinking was that she would bring it up when she was ready. She never did. To this day, I still don't know if she knows.

There's a couple of small things that have stopped me from bringing it up again. There was one time I asked her to play with my ass during sex, which she did, but when the subject of girls sticking their fingers up their boyfriends' asses came up with her and her friends, she joined in with them when they said they were doing it to get their boyfriends to stop trying anal. Another time, her sister discovered that the guy she was seeing was bisexual, and that he asked her to use a strap-on, and the two of them were rolling about laughing and mocking the poor guy. Usually when something like this happens, I'll come out with ""people are people, if it's not hurting anyone then good on them for keeping things interesting"" or something quite vague like that, but I really got the impression that it had made them uncomfortable. Every time someone we know comes out, it's always the same shocked reaction with jokes and uncomfortable laughter.

I decided that I wouldn't really need to tell her. I've explored my sexuality enough to know who I am and what I want, and since I don't plan on sleeping with anybody else again, I figured why does it matter?  Not once have I ever told anybody I'm straight, so I don't feel like I've been lying (although I do realise lying by omission is still lying), but recently I've started an arts project that could potentially mean I will have the spotlight on me, and because of the content and the message I am trying to send, people will ask about my own sexuality, and I don't want to lie.

So before I go much further with this thing, I want to get everything out in the open with her. I know superficially she is not homophobic, but I do think that there is some subconscious prejudice there, and I don't want her to see me any differently from how she sees me now. 

I would appreciate any advice on how to bring this up, any good ways of explaining things that you may have used with your own SOs, and how they reacted/if your relationship changed at all.

tl;dr - I told my girlfriend I was pansexual when I was drunk 4 years ago, don't know if she remembers and need help bringing it up/coming out. ",pansexual
I'm a little lost and confused with my self.,"So I've identified with being a lesbian for a while now. The hat fit... almost a year ago. And I've been out of the ""closet"" for about 2-3 years now. Only ever have been with a girl. 

Now, I've done my research, and looked long and hard at my self. I favor personality and characteristics over gender and appearance a lot, although I won't lie that there are still things appearance wise that I favor over others. I'd go so far as to say as that I care about gender very little, and it annoys me to an end that is hard to describe. I would forgo it completely if I could.

I suppose the question is, can one grow/change in to a different form of sexuality? Can this seriously be just a phase? And If yes, how do I go about going, hey this is a thing now with family and friends?

I need help telling my parents.,"I am lost. I know i'm pan and have told two of my friends and they supported me, as one is FTM and pan and the other is MTF asexual. But I have no clue on how to come out to my mom, and gramdma, who i live with, and my dad, who I don't live with and only facetime on weekends. Please all tips and advice would be appreciated (I'm 15 and male) ",pansexual
Pan turned lesbian?,"I've been on /r/pansexual for quite some time now and love all of your posts.

For clarity, I'm female.

For as long as I remember I've always been pansexual (I called myself bi for a long time before discovering pan). I've dated and had sex with girls and guys with no issue. Gender just didn't matter to me. I've only dated guys over the past year or so (Just how it worked out). 

I've been with my current boyfriend for about 6 months. He's perfect in almost every way (I won't bore you with details). We are in an open relationship, free to date whomever else we like and would love to have a triad with anther girl.

So here is the big issue; Over the last 2 months I've started losing my attraction to guys, at first it was just not being physically attracted to men but attraction was still possible if we hung out and got to know each other. This has sort of declined to the point where I have no attraction to men and the idea of a relationship feels wrong for me. I just can't seem to have any romantic connection. 

This has slowly started to affect my attraction to my BF. Right now I still want to be with him. I don't find him physically attractive but still get turned on when he talks to me and touches me. It seems to have affected our sex life, I just get bored and tired during sex and want to stop.

I'm really hoping that has something to do with not being with a girl for such a long time and after dating girls I start to become more pansexual. Then again, I may be clutching at straws :( 

Any advice is appreciated but I'm not sure it'll do any good.",pansexual

Does this make sense?,"I have been in a relationship with my husband since I was 15 (I am 30 now). I love him and am extremely committed to him. But over the past few years, I have begun to reconcile and realize some aspects of my sexuality. 

When I was younger, I was a ""tomboy"", and actually, looking back on it, I found females attractive before males. I also grew up in a very Christian and conservative environment, so honestly, I just never considered it. 

For the past year, I've identified as bisexual, as I find both men and women attractive, and thought that, if I weren't married, I would consider a relationship with a woman as easily as another man. However, in the past while, I've thought that it may not be as simple as that, and also realizing with more research that gender is more fluid than I had considered, especially talking with a friend who does not identify as either male or female. I'm realizing that I find not just males and females attractive, but individuals of other genders, too. 

I ""came out"" to my husband as bisexual, and he's perfectly fine with it, nothing in our relationship has changed. I've also told a few close friends. But now I'm thinking, am I really? I know it seems kind of silly to feel the need to define it, but I guess I'm just posting here to get an opinion. I don't know how else to ask, and this sounds like a stupid way to ask, but does it ""sound"" like I would be pansexual? ",pansexual
Help me discover how to identify.,"I currently identify as pansexual. I used to consider myself bi, but I changed to pan because I realized I loved for someone's personality not their looks ( or genitalia for that matter, ) but after reading the posts here, I am truly questioning who I am. I love for personality but also love both sexes for their own individual emotional quirks. I don't really find myself physically attracted to either sex. Am I a bi who judges personality, or a pan who isn't really gender blind? Help.

Pansexual Heteroromantic,"So, only recently, nearly a year ago, I've come to realize I'm pansexual. I'm a 23 year old man. I feel sexual attraction to a lot of different gender people, be it female, male, trans M2F or F2M, androgynous or gender-fluid... But I've also come to realize I'm a heteroromantic. When it comes to dating, I think I'd date only women. And what kinda scares me is does that mean I can actually call myself pansexual? I mean, because of heteroromanticism, I don't feel the need to come out to anybody, I don't share the ""pride"" in pansexuality that I see in this subreddit, sexuality for me is just something that's....there.

So, do you think I can call myself as pansexual? And do you think I wouldn't be shunned by the LGBT community, as I've seen a lot of hate and bickering and shaming inside the LGBT community (my sister is bi and has gotten hate from both straight people and distrust from lesbians).",pansexual
Don't Know What I'm Doing,"So, I'm pretty sure that I'm pansexual. But for some reason, I've been feeling very uncomfortable whenever I think about it lately. I don't know why; it's not something I feel bad about. Does anyone else ever feel like this?",pansexual

Argh I don't know what I am anymore.,"About 2 years ago I identified as a gay woman. I was in a psychiatric hospital (yeah I know, sounds like I'm crazy, but yeah, depression can really fuck you up). I met this girl who was transitioning to a guy but was still a girl, so we ended up having a thing, which ended badly. 

I met another girl who was in the process of becoming bigender, and I was attracted to her. We had a short-lived relationship. I then fell for my best guy friend later, and suddenly realized that I wasn't so gay anymore. 

Then, I didn't know what I was, but after the relationship ended, I went back to identifying as gay, thinking that because the relationship ended, I must be gay.

Fast forward to me having sex with my best girl friend, and I quite enjoyed it. I was torn between which gender I enjoyed more during sex. I was very confused tat that point, and stopped identifying as gay. I didn't have any clue as to what I was at that point, and I know I shouldn't worry so much about labels, but once I have one I feel much more comfortable with myself for some reason.

Now I'm dating a guy whos is mentally female. All I know now is that I'm not straight. What am I? I have no clue now. I think I might be pan, but I'm not sure. 

Please help me clear my own confusion about myself. I'm so lost in identification.",pansexual
Difficulty explaining identity to others,"Recently, people assume I'm bisexual even after I have explained that I identify as pansexual. I don't want to be rude and don't quite know how to correct people when they make this mistake.

Does this rule me out from pansexuality?,"I'm not sexually attracted to most transgenders, specifically those that go the route of sex reassignment (it mostly turns me off except for cute feminine boys that cross-dress without actually looking like a real female, but just because they play one of my kinks).

I'm also not ""gender-blind"" as I do behave sexually and romantically differently with people that fall in male, female or somewhere in between or plainly outside of that between. I acknowledge the existence of more than just two genders (or even the lack of it) for some individuals, but my mind has a hard time grasping the concept and instead sees fluidity between the traditional male/female identities (or a suppression/denial for picking one).

HOWEVER, I am attracted to androgynous and even intersex people, as long as the mix doesn't clash too much (mostly bodily hair, build, breast development, musculature, etc.)

For me, people's personality plays a bigger role than physical appearance, although it may play a role as an extra plus/bonus, and definitively the gender shapes the relationship, especially when it gets more intimate.

&gt; Bottom of the line: I'm in a polyamorous relationship and one of them is intersex, previously identifying as female but now identifying as male, and it isn't bothering me at all because I fell in love with her/him for the personality and as our relationship escalates I feel I want to express that love physically. **Yet, I wouldn't date a transvestite/transsexual because my mind detects there's something wrong in them (conflict, which I avoid because I'm full of it as is).**

I'm sorry if I worded things and they came out slightly disrespectful for any of you, but that's simply how I'm wired. No real disrespect is meant but transsexual people isn't my cup of tea~",pansexual

It is school holidays, I'm 13 M in primary school. Yeah, sexuality shouldn't be a high priority. However, I am going to go to my (M) friend, and say ""I'm bi"", less bluntly, but that's the basis. Coming out, basically. ""Why is this in the Pansexual, you devious youngster?"" Well, I know I am pansexual, however, I don't think, being a 13 year old Christian, my friend would see me quite the same, liking ""Non-Binary"" people (in addition to the 2 binary genders), he's not immature, but I can't know how he reacts. Should I explain the gender-queer thing and other (agender, ect) which is possibly the thing that will confuse him most, or should I wait till he's mature enough to not go ""Eww"". I am not saying he's stupid, he's quite clever, I'm saying, maybe I should soften the burn, then reveal it all. He's 13, and we're usually like that, and him not having any personal relation with non-binary people, he's stuck with stereotypes to go off. So should I trust him to understand? He has 2 Grandmas (homosexual, not trans*) after all, and he has never talked ill of them, nor have I. He knows I'm understanding, but I still am not sure.

TL;DR: Should I say I'm bi to my understanding Christian friend (who isn't preachy, mind you. He knows I'm atheist), or should I use bisexuality as a stepping stone (however, that could give bisexuality a bad name), and say I'm pansexual later.",pansexual
Looking for someone to relate to [rant/curiosity],"This post is going up at 5 in the morning, my time, so chances are it won't be seen, but if I don't write it now, I'll forget. Also, I apologize for any ugly wording; I have not slept yet, even though I really need to.

Anyway, hi. I'm a polyamorous pansexual, and I've found that I get crushes effortlessly. I just open my heart too easily, I suppose. I'm a 21-year-old guy, and I've had eight crushes in the past seven years, six of which have only developed in the last four years. And I guess I'm looking for somebody else who's experienced this. I feel like most people only have one or two crushes by my age, and then they actually find somebody who likes them back and they get together, at least for a while. And I simply find the people I'm close to attractive, because they're awesome people.

I do this spiral where they become close friends, then I become romantically interested in them, then physically interested. This happens with all of my friends, when we start hanging out more often. It hasn't really proven... problematic, but it has taken a toll on me, emotionally. Because I get feelings for them, and due to my need to be honest, I tell them, and the feelings, so far, are never reciprocated.

I know I'm only 21, I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, and I've told myself that hundreds of times. I just want somebody to actually like me back for once.

I dunno. I'm not trying to present a sob story here, nor am I looking for a solution. I just feel like there's something wrong with me, like I'm pathetic for letting my heart out there so much. And maybe there is, and maybe I am. But I'm curious to see if there's anybody else who has had this issue.

Thanks in advance!",pansexual
"Actually not so sure anymore... [Rant, maybe]","I'm using a blank throwaway because my girlfriend knows my reddit account. I need to sort this out independent of her, because I think I might actually be gay.

Ok. I'm a male in my early 20s. Quite a few months ago, after the end of a long term relationship, I started questioning and researching, and eventually came to the philosophically satisfying conclusion that I am pansexual. It felt great! I came out to a lot of my friends on an individual basis, got out, met people, dated around, and even had a pretty fun thing with some polyamorous folks for a bit. It was mind-opening. I was attracted to everyone I chose to be with regardless of gender, and the split was fairly even, though I didn't actually date any of them long term. I felt freed.

Then I met a girl. She's perfect in nearly every way. We drunkenly bonded over the same fandoms, have a lot of similar hobbies, our personalities mesh, her parents are cool, and we are able to quell each others' anxieties just by being around each other. She's really incredible. Even the sex is mind-blowingly good. We got to the point of calling each other ""girlfriend"" and ""boyfriend"" pretty quickly. Lately, though, one thing had been eating away at me with no logical explanation: Her gender.

It's killing me. Pansexuality seemed so perfect. I'm a humanist, I'm a therapist, I love people, and I love to find the good in people. But for some reason it doesn't feel right. I'm sexually attracted to her. I even REALLY like her. She's quickly become my best friend. I can rely on her, and open up to her...

But I'm feel so attached to the idea of dating a boy, almost obsessively. I shouldn't be so focused on that if I'm really pansexual, right? I don't really know what to do. I've even talked to her about it (crying, breaking down after an already shitty day), and her holding me even made me feel better. But I can't shake the feeling that I might not be as equally attracted as I thought.

Has anyone here had a similar experience? How did you handle it? Is it just that I haven't had a boyfriend yet? Maybe after one relationship I'll be able to go back to not caring. Or maybe I am just homoflexible. I don't know.

tl;dr: Male, thought I was pansexual and got a girlfriend, but I think I might actually be just gay. Not sure what to do.",pansexual
A question of definition,"Hi I some time ago began questioning my sexuality.  After reading and learning a lot I think I have come to the conclusion that pan-sexuality fits the best, I think.  The only thing that doesn't seem to fit with me about it is this idea of ""gender blind"".

I don't 'feel' gender blind mostly because what i find attractive about a woman isn't the same qualities that if find attractive in a man, and even more so in people of non-gender binaries.  Now I understand that people don't belong in boxes, but I was hoping someone might help me find a better term for how i feel.

Thank you so much for the help

"Aaand I would like to thank reddit for creating this beautiful subreddit. (A story, a rant, and some venting, with a lot of parenthesis)","So I identify myself as a pensexual; however, it was a few months ago that I found an accurate label for my sexuality (not to mention a very *slight* struggle to come to terms with it). After talking to an online friend, whom is knowledgeable about such matters, I was able to accept myself for who I am (this may sound like a big struggle, but really I wasn't that insecure, more like unsure). After that, I kind of blew off my sexuality as I didn't think I would feel lonely or anything, since a majority of my friends are LGBTQ. Alas, over time, I found myself to feel quite lonely and ""unique"" (don't take this as arrogance, it's more like ""unique"" in the sense of isolation, as there wasn't anyone i could relate too). So after talking to the previously mentioned friend, she mentioned Reddit, to which I cringed. I confess that I am a refugee from 4chan and that I looked down upon reddit for, well, being Reddit. When I learned from CGPGrey that Reddit had subreddits and such, I began to see how diverse reddit is and so, I find myself here right now, reading posts from r/pansexual, feeling less alone and happy to know there is a community I can really connect with.

"Identify as Pans, but say Bi?","Hey all just a bit stressed and curious how everyone handles these situations. 

So, I personally identify myself as pans, but I've come to find many people don't really know what pans is. Since, I figured Bi was a close enough sexuality that's more easily known I've just been telling people who ask that I'm Bi. But in that I've come to find just how stressful that is. Not only because it would be easier to just say I'm pans without having to explain myself, but I feel so ostracized by a significant amount of people when I say I'm Bi. Gays usually try to sway me to be fully gay and a lot of women find that bisexuality is untrustworthy or something. 

I don't know it's all just incredibly stressful and I'm not really sure how to handle things. I feel like it makes it really hard to be in a relationship unless I just start lying and telling gays I'm gay and women I'm straight. Because if saying I'm Bi is so hard to compute I don't understand how anyone outside of other pans are gonna fully understand.   ",pansexual

Christmas coming out,"So i came out to my dad today. We've had long talks before about really deep topics and now I am closer to him now than I ever was, so I decided to tell him that I am pansexual. I knew he was an open minded person because he has told me his views on several things. I started out beating around the bush, reminding him of when I was ally, then i finally mustered up the strength to tell him that I identified most with pansexuality. It didn't come as a surprise to him because he said that there was some ""gay gene"" on his side of the family. My aunt (his sister) is a closeted bisexual, his cousin is a closeted lesbian, and he himself is very fluid in his sexuality, so much so that he didn't care to label it. I was so surprised and so happy to know that I wasn't alone :). To wrap this up he just told me to go with the flow and to never change who I am for anybody. Before I really got to know my dad, inside and out, I thought both my parents were strict african christians (they're still african if anyone was wondering), but it turns out it was just my mom. My dad had completely different views that he never brought up for the sake of keeping the peace between him and my mom. I'm planning on coming out to my mom before I go to college (so in about 2 years). I know seeing her reaction will be tough but as long as i have my dad and my siblings behind me I will be okay. All in all, my Dad's overwhelming acceptance was the best Christmas gift I've gotten and I felt like sharing a part of the experience with you guys :)

A little bit of a vent/rant.,"So I'm going out with this amazing guy who is pretty much perfect for me in almost every single way... someone better for me (at least in this point of my life) probably doesn't exist. I've been with him for 10 months, we lost our virginities to each other and I love him with all of my heart.

But sometimes I long for a girlfriend... like really, really long for one. I don't want two relationships and I don't want to leave my boyfriend but it's just something I never really had despite always being attracted to girls and not always sure if I was attracted to guys.

I don't think it helps that everyone assumes I'm straight and treats me as such (for instance asking me if I'd have sex with guy a or guy b if I weren't with my boyfriend) even though my boyfriend is literally the first guy I've ever felt romantically attracted to. Even if I tell people that the majority seem to still see me as straight. It's also still sounds weird saying I have a boyfriend or calling him 'my boyfriend'...

How do you explain pansexuality to people? What analogies do you use?,"As someone who doesn't feel the need to hide the fact that I'm pansexual, who is masculine/'straight-acting' and often hangs out at gay bars/clubs, the sexuality question often comes up and I always answer honestly (that I'm pansexual). This then leads to follow up questions about what pansexuality means/is.

I usually go with the explanation that pansexuality is like 'gender blindness', and that while do I have a physical type (feminine looking, but not necicessily fem-acting), personality is the primary influencing factor in my attraction to people (at least in a meaningful respect).

Most people can grasp this concept, and while I will attempt to further explain if needed, I don't give much credence to the scepticism posed by those who cant. Although, as someone who likes to communicate ideas and promote understanding I would be very much interested in hearing the explanations or analogies others have found effective in explaining pansexuality to others.

Removing the sexual lamination,"Hi everyone,
I guess ill touch upon the title a little more; as it currently stands I feel like I'm on a sexual adventure (mostly theoritical to be fair) and the more i explore, the more ridiculous sexual barriers seem. Most of my exploration has been to see what human contact can swell sexual emotion in me and different sorts of pornography. With this I have yet to find a genre that is impossible to cum to, but some are more exciting than others. My current greatest interest is a feminine looking she-male with a huge cock. In terms of relationships, Mind-mates and explorers are the key to my sunken heart.

Anyways, i was wondering if it was common for people to discover their sexuality in a systemic way or is it usually more fluid? And is there any advice to meet open people with which to more intimately explore pan-sexuality and relationships. ",pansexual
Are all these labels and bickering really necessary?,"I don't know what sexuality I am, and that's just the way I want it to be because I love people for who they are, not what they are (I'm sure you guys can relate), but if people could just stop arguing over what the true definition of their sexuality is in order to prove what they identify with, it would solve a lot of bullshit. YOU decide who you are, not a dictionary. You know who you are and who you love and nothing else has the power to confirm or deny that. 

I think one of the big problems in this world is that people are too infatuated with who other people's love, and then it's easy to sit and criticize them- maybe because you disagree, or maybe because they don't match up to the definition you found during a Wikipedia binge- and I'm pretty sure that most of you know the feeling of being criticized about who you love. 

So yeah, this is my new rant against the world. Fuck labels man really. Next I think I'll go release the marine life from SeaWorld...

META: Pansexuality v. Demisexuality,"Wondering if we can't talk about terminology a little. A lot of people treat pansexualuty as equivalent to demisexuality but pansexuality, to me, is different. 

**Pansexuality:** experiencing sexual attraction to people of all genders. 

**Demisexuality:** experiencing sexual attraction only if there is a close, personal bond to the person. 

* *How are they different?*

Demisexuals may be hetero/homo sexual and pansexuals might not be demisexuals.

I think it helps to break apart the concept of attraction into sexual attraction and romantic attraction. Sexual attraction has to do with who excites you sexual, who you feel sexual desire towards, while romantic attraction has to do with people who you want intimate, romantic relationships with, people who you fall in love with, etc. A pansexual might be panromantic or even aromantic, and maybe hetero/homoromantic. A demisexual may be panromantic, but they might also be hetero/homo romantic and can be any kind of sexual; homo/hetero/pan. Demisexuality usually excludes aromantic as an option, though it's not impossible. An asexual might be panromantic as well. And none of these definitions are the absolute definition, nor are these different terms sufficiently all encompassing. 

* *Why bring this up?*

I'm pansexual, but I'm not demisexual nor totally panromantic. Many of you are, and that's great! Many of you, maybe even most of you, also seem to be demisexual, pansexual, and panromantic - fantastic! But because I'm not demisexual, and panromantic doesn't quite cover me, the phrase *""hearts not parts""* doesn't work for me. If it works for you, great! Embrace it. But please don't define all pansexuals as being the same because we're not. I'm not. And that excludes me. 

I am pansexual. I find people of all different kinds of genders sexy, but not everyone in the world. And while I feel attracted to people of all kinda of genders, the attraction changes depending on their gender presentation. And then there's other obvious personal preferences which, while not as strong, certainly influence who I am attracted to. I am attracted to masculine type people in a different way than feminine type people, and differently attracted to men than women, and non-binary people are different still. There are some people who I am just not attracted to, regardless of who they are. The parts, gender, gender expression, and a whole bunch of things all factor into my sexual and romantic attraction, and I don't feel equal attraction towards every variation even if I am open to any variation in principle. I'm just not wholly limited by gender like someone who is monosexual (homo/hetero), or even bisexuals.

So that's what I wanted to talk about. You're not obligated to change anything or the way you use words or define things, I just thought if give my perspective and see how if anyone else feels the same. It might seem pedantic, but it's how I feel. Thanks for hearing me out. ",pansexual
Hi everybody,"To mercifully spare you a wall of text, I'm just going to link to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pansexual/comments/1o0rnf/recently_realised_im_pansexual/ccqtq4h) comment and share a little bit more about my feelings ~two weeks into this new perspective on my sexuality.

One thing I noticed was how offensive some things really are. For example, my little brother has this ""sassy voice"" he uses when he wants to mock something effeminate. A few years ago I might have found it funny, and a month ago I might have thought it was a bad talentless joke, but now? Well, its not funny now. Its quite offensive, backwards, and downright mean. And unfortunately I realize I'm looking into a mirror of my own past.

Speaking of looking back on my past, I realized that I have this habit of shaving my head when I felt ""too effeminate"", like this was making me ""dirty"" and I had to purge it to ""purify"" myself. Well since coming to terms with my sexuality those feelings have went away. Come to think of it, that probably came from some negative reenforcement I received as small child about that sort of thing. Besides I look pretty goofy bald anyway.

Another thing I learned which is a bit tangential, but ""in private"" mode on the iOS version of Chrome is pretty terrible at not tracking you, so don't use it.

"Nobody to talk to, need help telling SO?","Throwaway, just because he knows my main account &amp; looks at it regularly.

I'm a 21 year old female &amp; I've been living with my boyfriend for over a year now. 
When we began this relationship, I told him I was straight. I always had an inkling that I liked girls as well, but I didn't think much of it. Regardless, I still never felt right about calling myself bisexual.

Ever since we moved here, I've lost contact with my old friends because they're so far away and in 14+ months, I've yet to make new ones. So I've had a lot of time to be alone with my thoughts and I came to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter to me what a person identifies as. Male, Female, Trans, etc. I love it all. I'm just not sure how to convey this to my boyfriend because I'm a bit afraid. He's spoken badly about an ex-girlfriend of his who cheated with another girl, so he's a bit touchy. What do I say ? I'm terribly awkward and unsure of how to bring it up. :(

I've love to maybe make like-minded friends who can help.

Recently realised I'm pansexual.,"Over the past few years I was never really sure about who I was. I kept saying that I was straight because, to tell the truth, I didn't really know how I felt about my own sexuality and have always been scared of saying anything other then that.

I knew that I wasn't straight but never felt that I was gay either. Back then I didn't know about pansexuality so being bisexual was the only thing that seemed to fit with my sexuality. But even bisexual didn't feel like the right way to put it.

A couple of weeks ago a friend of mine at college was writing an article about gender discrimination. We got talking about it and he later asked me how I identified myself. It took quite a bit of courage but I knew that he was one of the easiest people to talk to I would be able to find so I told him how I felt about my sexuality. He told me that I was probably pansexual.

It's taken a little while for me to understand myself but now I'm happier then I have been in a long time. It finally feels like I know who I am and I don't have to hide from myself.",pansexual

How does one deal with parental rejection?,"Backstory:
&gt;I recently discovered that I am pansexual, yet have never mentioned a word to anyone (especially my family).
&gt;When I discovered that there was a community at my school GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) -as they also support pansexuals/bisexuals-, I contemplated joining to hopefully met others ""like me"". 
&gt;At some point in a conversation with my mother, I struggled answering the question ""what club do you want to join"". When I finally responded and said GSA, my mother laughed and said ""Why would you want to join such nonsense, focus on your academics"". It hurt when she said that but I simply didn't reply. Later on in the conversation she stated ""You know men aren't all bad, just because I had an abusive relationship doesn't mean you need to like girls"".
&gt;This statement pissed me off leading me to say ""it's not that I have a choice, I like both males &amp; female people"". After hours of silence I tried convincing her about the club, yet she ignored me stating its a waste of time &amp; shouldn't follow me when I apply to university.
&gt;I have always had a strong relationship with my mother, and hoped in the distant future that she would accept my sexuality... Yet I feel as if I have been completely rejected, by the person I trust the most in the world.

**TL;DR** = Teenager rejected by their closest person in the world (their mother) for ""coming out"".

Question about coming out-ish...,"Hey, guys and gals and everyone inbetween,

I have a question about not necessarily coming out as a public event or statement, but just getting out... to those around me that i'd be interested in, I guess?

Here's a bit of a wall-of-life-story-text. I spent my first 4 years of college (on my 5th now) known as the male half of that adorable high school couple who got engaged, will be together forever, etc. Well, the engagement didn't work out for school/career reasons, and we broke up. Soon after, I started noticing that I was developing crushes on lots of people, and gender didn't seem to matter. So I came to a pretty well thought-out conclusion that I am pansexual.

The problem is, my community, and my entire circle of friends, and especially the guys I like know me as long-term-rock-solid-straight-relationship-guy. Which makes it kind of hard to (I guess) open the door to dating them without just walking up awkwardly and saying ""Hey, so... I'm not straight anymore, wanna go out?""

So my question is, how do I approach the topic or make it happen if I'm interested in some one of my same sex given my public identity? I've never liked too much facebook attention, and I don't feel like everyone around me needs to know until I decide to make a relationship public, so I don't really want to make a big facebook profile change or have a coming out announcement or anything like that if I can help it.

Thanks for any advice you can give. It's all new territory to me, so navigating non-heteronormative social structure has proven more difficult than I expected.",pansexual

"Increasing focus on lgbt+ issues and identities, as well as advances in neuroscience and psychology has a good chance to change the way we view love, sexuality and relationships. Realistically, how long do you think it will be till the pansexual ideal becomes the prevalent polysexual identity?","I've noticed more and more people chiming in on their pansexual identity, holding the 'bisexual' moniker only because it's more widely understood and it's made me wonder: How long will it take our current understanding of love, sexuality and relationships to evolve to something more accurate, succinct and more suited to our changing society? The global pool of knowledge on it seems to be a mishmash of old-world hangups, religious doctrine, misinformed storytelling, superstitious beliefs, independently reached conclusions, pseudoscience, and out-dated research. Eventually something more sensical and accurate will push through and become the dominant belief (hopefully not the current maze that is lgbt+). My quesetion is, when do you think that'll happen? And what do you think that future will look like?

I have no data to support to my claim of change beyond what I've mentally noted over the 3 years I've spent on reddit and the logical assumption that, because of the internet (and reddit in particular), more young lgbt+ kids and young adults are discovering the pansexual idea and finding that it fits their tendencies more accurately than the bisexual identity. Factors like bisexual invisibility and denial, and thus living in a monosexual world, contribute to making it difficult to find proper guidance. There is still more than enough infighting among the lgbt+ populace over identity, membership, stereotypes and other assumptions to agree that, looking at the big picture, we're a huge unorganized mess of small communities.

Or maybe you don't agree. Personally I think we could do with a more unified and easily understood structure that better represents what we the human race, through science, psychology and philosophy, know about love and sex. Tell me what you think.",pansexual

From me to you,"I have all the respect in the world for people who can come out and be completely honest and forthright about who they are. But my respect for those of us that identify as anything other than homosexual or heterosexual and still come out is even more. I recognize this is a difficult process for anyone, but I have found people are more accepting of individuals who identify as homosexual than of those who identify as pansexual, asexual, bisexual or any other label. It's unfortunate our society stresses individuals to explain how and why they identify the way they do. Is it anyone's business how I define myself? If I have chosen to share with you my sexual identity, I'd like to assume you are familiar with my personality and the other ways I define myself. If I say I'm a geek, should I be expected to explain to an extent that is frustrating? Maybe you just can't understand my love for Star Trek. I don't are to turn you into a Trekkie, so what is the purpose in exhausting the topic? Acceptance. I always thought patience was the hardest virtue to learn. It's key to acceptance. I can never expect someone else to accept who I am if I don't accept them in return.

[Discussion Thread] Pansexual Philosophy - What does it mean to you? Why? How did you reach your conclusion? What wisdom would you pass on to others? What do you think everyone else is doing wrong? Why?,"Hi! Philosophy is a big part of my life. I regularly listen to podcasts, take time to think about things thoroughly and talk with others about it so how about a subreddit discussion on our favorite topic?

---------------

Of course most of us have the common and very general idea that love is independent of gender, and sexuality isn't limited by procreation, religion, or sometimes even your own personal beliefs (ie: those confusing early years..). But have you ever thought deeper on it? Or maybe went off the deep end and thought of where love and sex IS limited?

Half joking and half in ignorance, people ask if pansexuality means you want to marry inanimate objects or fuck horses. Have you ever wondered this from a serious point of view? ""Love ALL the people!"" is a sentiment I'm sure you've all declared. Keep in mind that 'people' includes those under the age of 18 and over the age of 70. In some places in the world, dolphins have also been recognized as non-human people. Recognizing other/all animals as conscious and sentient beings is also currently a hot topic. Regardless of that, considering the relationship between the words (and ideas) of 'persons' and 'personality' and the criteria that determine your attraction to a 'person', where do you draw the line? Why?

------------

I think this stuff is important. It's important to know who you are and why you do things. Carrying on in ignorance, while sometimes inevitable (and acceptable) for some people, is overall detrimental to all in society if NO ONE takes the time to think about it. It also prevents us from graduating from old ways of thinking and evolving into more advanced societies. It doesn't help anyone if only the people that do it (philosophers) learn new things.

I should also add, I encourage you all to even talk about taboo subjects like love/sex/friendship with non-humans and people (humans) under the age of 18. Why it's wrong, why it could be right, or in some cases right but also wrong,  how one relates to the other...etc. I'm advocating nothing, however. These things are interesting because, for one, the age barrier varies from country to country. In older times (and even in some places in the world today) the common understanding was that sexual maturity meant ready to be married and have children. This brings up another good point; Now we seem to favor development over the urgency to procreate. How much do you think this has changed us? When did this sort of thing start happening? Our changing ideas of relationships brings in a whole different matter besides just procreation. Anyway, discuss!",pansexual

"Pansexuals, how does physical appearance affect the level of sexual attraction you feel for a person?","I'd say, for me, sexual attraction is a blend of some parts physical and non-physical factors. I wouldn't exclude anyone based on gender or particular physical traits. I have a bit of a gut feeling that determines my physical attraction to a person. The sum of all of their physical traits, rather than checking items off a list of traits I find appealing. Once I get to know a person, their non-physical qualities tend to affect my physical perception of them. Ex: I become more sexually attracted to a geeky person with a warm laugh or I find a loud, rude person to be very unattractive.

I'm a 35 years old cis male, and most of my sex life has been with cisgender men. I'm in an open marriage with a wonderful man who used to identify as bi but who now identifies as gay. I'm pansexual however, and recently my attraction to women has become a lot stronger than it used to be. I now find boobs to be incredibly distracting, and I'm even catching myself checking out women's asses; something that I've never really experienced. I was traveling in Montreal a couple of weeks ago (I live two provinces away), and I ended up having awesome sex with one of my female friends with whom there had been sexual tension for quite some time. The experience was really intense, and I was looking at her in a way that I had never looked at a woman before - I was brimming with lust.

Here's the thing. I feel lonely and alienated right now. I feel something is changing with my sexuality, and it's impacting me in a deep way (and I actually love this turn of events), but I have nobody around me who can relate to that. It's not that I can't talk about what's happening to me; I'm pretty open about this with my husband and my friends. But there's nobody around me to say ‚ÄúOh my god! I so know what you mean! I totally went through that!‚Äù I need somebody to understand, with whom I can share that experience and bond with over that, but there's no one. :(

Also, I never had the opportunity to really explore my heterosexuality. It's sort of ironic, because I've definitely explored a lot of other things most people have never done. But I never had a lot of sex with women, and now I want it bad. I want somebody female with whom I can bond and get it on all the time like crazy. I no longer want heterosexual sex to be something that happens once in a blue moon when I get really lucky - I want to gorge myself in it. I want some heterosexual abundance. ;) But I don't know how to make that happen, and to be honest, I'm a lot more shy with women than with guys (with whom my strategy tends to be ‚Äúnice shoes, want a blowjob?‚Äù).

Name - Will

Age - 17

Discovered pansexuality when - This is a rather funny story :o I guess looking back I was always pan, I mean I only wanted to befriend rather than date people, I came from Essex, anyone from England knows what Essex is like - people losing their virginity at 12 average! I myself never had a relationship, romantic or sexual due to a feeling which I now realise was my pansexuality: I could not when the maturity level of relationships at that time centered around sexual desire and physical attraction. 

I also grew/grow up in a family of abusive, homophobic and racist extremist who thought anything non-hetero was against nature and an abomination, and went as far as forcing my brother to break up with his girlfriend because she was chinese! Parents eh? :P

May last year I met someone on steam who contacted me after a game and we befriended, we even found out we had  been on the same forum a few years before XD Needless to say, he was pansexual and although this doesn't seem like a long enough time to some, we fell in love after a week or two. I was far from looking for a relationship, especially with a man as I thought my self heterosexual, but I am not suprised, it is far easier to fall in love pansexually it seems when you have never seen the man's face at that point, the physical really had no factor in it! 

I was tolerant of sexualities and differences no matter my upbringing, which lead me to, after a confusing moment with myself, accepting my pansexuality, now we're still together and it will be our 1 year aniversary soon :D 

I only have to wait another year after that before I can leave my parents (who yes found out and no they didn't accept me, they're abandoning me the moment they legally can when I'm 18 :P) and live with him. the end hopefully :o

But usually when someone asks me my sexual orientation I say ""Yeeeaaah.... that's a little bit of a gray area. I like who I like.""

I don't have many preferences. I like who I like on an individual basis. I don't have a ""type."" I'd be 100% willing to give anyone a chance assuming they meet 3 criteria: Have a nice face; be capable of intelligent conversation; don't be fat (I'm super skinny. It's almost a necessary preference.)

And it works. I don't need to come here and ask people to label me. Because fuck labels, I don't need pigeonholed. And you don't either!

I've seen so many posts with people saying they are confused about their orientation or that they think they might be one thing or another... but really, who cares?! If you like someone, you know you do. What's there to be confused about?

Like who you like; fuck labels.",pansexual
Confused gay cub,"All of my life i've never found myself attracted to women at all, and always towards men, however recently i've grown more towards women, and trans but mostly masculine trans and the thicker set of women. I am currently engaged to an amazing guy who is Pansexual and we are polyamorous. With these new feelings I find myself confused on who I am, after identifying as gay for my life and I am unsure if these feelings and attraction is just curiosity or discovering my pansexuality.

I first began to have these feelings before my current boyfriend with my previous one, after trying role playing a few times and he would roll play trans, and I did not find myself turned off to him or the sex. After going to a few furry events and an encounter with a FTM I found myself curious on the thought of a woman but no real interest at the time.

The past few months however I have noticed myself growing more interested in women and transgender and no drop in interest in men. How do I know if this is just curiosity or pansexuality? 

TL;DR I don't know if its curiosity or pansexuality",pansexual

Looking for some help figuring out my thoughts,"Hey everyone, I have some questions about myself and my sexual identification. As a forefront, I apologize for the use of labels or anything of that variety that may come across as offensive to people. I just learned about pansexuality and I'm still being educated about it. My girlfriend came out to me about being her pansexual this past sunday and it has been a bit of a roller coaster ride since then. At first I felt confused and hurt, but after talking to her, doing a ton of thinking, and becoming somewhat educated on the subject, I realized that pansexuality was something that's very interesting to me. I have only ever been in relationships with women and have only had sexual contact with them too, aside from a few occurrences when I was very, very young. When I was reflecting on myself, I realized that I was open to the idea of being romantically and mentally attracted to anyone and everyone. That being said, I haven't felt a romantic or mental attraction to another male. Also, when it comes to the idea of being sexually intimate with another male, I get hesitant. Not a complete, 100% ""No I'd never do that,"" but more of a ""Maybe with the right person, I'd consider it."" This being said, when I see a good looking man, I recognize his handsomeness and I sometimes feel a slight sexual attraction due to it. Due to my hesitance about sexual relations with another man, I'm not sure if that fits the sexual attraction part of pansexuality. I have no idea on what this 'makes' me and I figured that this was the place to go. Am I somewhat pansexual, something else, or just completely over-thinking this entire thing? I suppose I just would like some help figuring out my thoughts. Thanks for listening everyone!

TL;DR: I believe that I have the potential for romantic relationships towards people of all gender identities and biological sexes. However, I'm not entirely sure I'm 100% comfortable with sexual relationships with another man.",pansexual
Am I pansexual?,"For a long time, I've identified myself as bisexual. Though I do seem to favor girls, I no doubt am also attracted to guys. However, I recently learned about pansexuality, and the more I read up on it the more it sound more like me. However, I'm not completely sure if it's accurate for me, because there are some definite differences in my attractions to genders.

The best way to describe my sexuality would be that I like girls, and anything that could pass for a girl would do. While with girls I am not picky whatsoever, and am attracted to girls of all races and body sizes and even girls that look manly/androgynous, with guys, I am extremely picky. The guy must look noticeably feminine. They can still be obviously a boy, but those feminine features are a must. They must also have a slender, feminine frame, despite the fact that I've dated girls with some weight on them. They can't be taller than me, despite the fact that I have no problem dating girls that are taller than me. They need to be someone I can dominate, despite having no such desires for domination towards women. Muscles on a guy are a huge turn off for me, despite muscles on a girl being a huge turn on. Also, I love it when they have medium to long hair. The more the guy looks like a girl the better, it seems. I also seem to be extremely attracted to androgynous people, no matter what their actual sex. 

Then there's the matter of transvestites/cross-dressers/anything else that would qualify as a trap. LOVE THEM. Some of my biggest sexual fantasies involve traps. Transvestites who look convincingly female, with breasts, but still possessing a penis, are probably the thing I'm most attracted to. Cross-dressers also really get me going, but only when they're convincing. A guy in a dress that's obviously a guy in a dress doesn't do anything for me. Manly looking transvestites also don't do it for me.

When it comes to the matter of dating someone who used to be a different gender, but has made the switch completely, I have no issues with this. If a woman I had been dating for months suddenly told me she used to be a man, it wouldn't phase me for a second. I also obviously don't mind if they're still in the transition. Doesn't matter not one bit.

I think about covers it all. So, basically, I'll date anyone. It doesn't matter what sex you were born as or what gender you identify as, that doesn't matter to me. If I'm attracted to you, I'll date you, no matter how complicated it gets from there. This is what makes me believe I am pansexual. However, when it comes to attraction, I seem to be, for the most part, attracted to women, or anyone close enough. I've never been attracted to anyone that didn't have strong feminine facial qualities. Would this be considered pansexual?

*Note: Apparently the word ""trap"" is derogatory. I'm not going to change it in my post, because I can't think of any other term that encompasses that whole spectrum of biological males that look and dress female. However, I will promise to try to avoid using it in the future, and I hope you all know I don't mean it in a bad way! Also, apparently ""used to be a ____"" is also derogatory. I have a trans friend who uses the term all the time, and she has stated that she doesn't see anything wrong with it, and that it's just people being needlessly sensitive. She equated it to how I don't care about being called the n word while many of my race do, and urged me to treat it the same way. So that's exactly what I do, I avoid using it around people that I know will be offended (meaning ya'll), but that's about it. I won't apologize for that one, or change it.",pansexual
I have a question which I can't seem to get a damn answer to.,"Okay throwaway just because I have friends in real life who know my reddit who don't know what I'm about to say.

I am attracted to two specific types: females and male to female transexuals. I am a man. 

Some people have said I am straight, some people say I am gay. 

I realize that sexuality is not black and white, obviously. But what the fuck am I? Yes, I get the whole thing how male to female transexuals identify as women. Therefore I am straight. 

Its just that I don't feel *straight*, on grounds that if I were just straight I'd be attracted to just biological women. I'm just confused, I don't know what to call my sexual preferences.

Pansexual vs. Soul-sexual?,"When asked about my orientation, I used to always use bi.  After some ""growing up"", I would explain my orientation (to those I knew and were comfortable with) as ""soul-sexual""; meaning I was attracted by a person's *insides* (their personality/soul etc) and not what happened to be on the outside.  Now, I am married to a woman ( my soul mate that happened to be in a ""woman's body"", and since I have no plans or desires to be with anyone but her, I generally refer to myself as lesbian to save time/confusion.  

I have since run into the term Pansexual and wonder if this the universally accepted ""label"" for me?  Not that I'm into labels *per se*, but I find I am intrigued by this concept as a whole.",pansexual

"I really, really, really don't care about appearances.","I need to rant a bit and I figured this subreddit would probably understand best. 

I don't care what a person looks like. And I never have. In high school all my friends would talk about the guys they found attractive and gush about someone being super hot and all the stereotypical high school girl talk. And I always just nodded along and occasionally threw out a passive agreement. But when it came to my turn to explain my ""type"" or gush on someone I thought was hot, I never had anything to offer. 

I would usually respond honestly with ""Looks don't matter to me."" And my friends would often find this arrogant of me. I never meant it as such and I never cared that they did like how people looked. It just wasn't my thing. 

For a while I faked it. I would force myself to remember a celebrities name to mention if I needed to or I'd pretend to be enthusiastic about their opinions. But I didn't like it. The celebrities I chose were always based on the character they played and if I liked the personality of that character. 

And it always came back to personality. When I mentioned some stranger being cute, it was because their outfit or overall style gave the idea of a certain personality type that I usually got along with or made friends with. 

When I dated (which was before I realized I liked more than just guys) I dated geeky, unattractive boys. And I'm not talking about the geeky guys that people now find awkwardly cute or the guys that fake geekyness. No I dated the ones people really found awkward/very unattractive. And it really bugged me that in those times, they let looks get in the way of liking someone.

But really, I don't care about looks. You ask me my type and I'll describe a personality. You ask me for a style that I like on people and I'll describe the stereotypical style that goes with the personality I just described. If you ask me if that person over there is cute, I'll give you an answer. But if you let me spend 5 minutes with them, I can confirm how ""cute"" I really find them.

Thanks for letting me rant. Hopefully someone here will understand and share my feelings.

My friend just came out to his parents in a rather poetic letter...,"Pansexual friend is too introverted to talk face-to-face, and when parents found some conversations with his boyfriend, (long-distance). and began to suspect, he wrote them this letter, including calling them out about how they've treated him over the years. Thought Reddit might enjoy it

&gt;
[Teacher] suggested I write you a letter explaining everything because of my inability to talk in person, she said she would tell you, and I want to point out that I cannot physically tell you as much as I want to, confidence is not a factor that can be removed simply because of family blood.
&gt;
To come straight to the point, I‚Äôm pansexual, if you don‚Äôt know what that means it is the fact gender does not matter to me, this is not homosexuality, or even bisexuality; they are based upon an attraction to physical gender. I simply realise that love is not something to be chosen so pathetically as by appearance, whether by emotion, our own subconscious, or by God; we fall in love to a person and no creed, gender, race or colour can change that love. Some scholars say that pansexuality is the closest of all those orientations we have to experiencing God‚Äôs love, for what is closer to God‚Äôs unconditional, all encompassing love for us than a disregard for gender, thought or appearance as factors to your ability to love? 
I never had a girlfriend because I refused to be so petty as to enter relationships for the sake of a relationship - there are three things relationships look for; either that, sexual desire, or love. I look neither for the former not be so sinful too seek the intermediary, and love is not something to find or seize, it develops - if God wills it. I met [boyfriend], made sure, so sure that he was who he said he was. I spent months talking, asking for proof before I accepted he was who he was, including him video calling to show his appearance, phoning up and researching friends of his to make sure they are who he said they were, researching his school/college, making sure the friends went there too, making sure what they said about him matched what he said, I point out if you are still concerned I can sit down and call him with you, he can enter a video, show his passport, school documents, even bring his mother and grandmother into the video to say who he is, I am not seeing him for 2 years, and when I do I am bringing 6 other friends plus their families if they want to visit Canada as well in case all of that other evidence was somehow a lie ‚Äì what more can I do to prove it to you?
&gt;
I admit after a while we fell in love, and I would be offended if you claimed it was not so ‚Äì I prayed for hours and hours on end asking God if it was love, if it was in his plan, if he wanted me to accept this or to abstain, if it was good in his eyes etc. And I am certain, more certain of anything in my life (but that I want to give it all to God) that this is what God wills, God gives us not what we want, but what we need ‚Äì and I have learnt so much from this, God has opened my eyes to so much of his plans through this. I had been praying to God for months before, sick with worry, I was unsure about how love was a reason for why he gave us free will, why he sent Jesus, the final link for me understanding God was to understand why, and the answer was love, but what is this ‚Äòlove‚Äô? I asked - I didn‚Äôt understand love, never being in love, and because of that I prayed for him to show me so that I could understand truly the love behind all his actions. And that is what he did, I am so much stronger in my convictions of God because I can relate, maybe only a fraction of his infinite love, but a fraction is enough for me to appreciate the glory of God.
&gt;
You may now ask why I didn‚Äôt tell you, why I held the information back? I am scared of you. Scared of your intolerance ‚Äì and while my teachers assured me that you don‚Äôt mind ‚Äì that in the end ‚Äòwhen it comes down to their son, the true nature of parents are revealed‚Äô. But you may forgive me for being unsure when for 16 years you have mentioned non-heterosexual relations with distain, bitterness and even anger. You are traditional in your Christian mindset and I appreciate that, but I am scared you will see who I am as ‚Äòone of those liberals‚Äô whose term you spit out with hatred, or at least it seems to be so every time. I am scared of your proud attitude, and while it is ok to be so; you do believe that what you do is right, holy even, while all other choices are ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, morally in some cases you claim.
That is what leads me to my main fear, that you control my life. You argue (and I agree) that a lack of concern leads only to problems for the child, including dangers, yet realise please that freedom is not synonymous with this lack of apprehension, or even love! No one I know yet one girl (who ironically her parents you described as being ‚Äòdangerous, leaving her in town alone at night‚Äô, which is perhaps a nod to the point that not all forms of obsessive control mean love and care‚Ä¶that you do not need to be controlling to love me) has parents so obsessive or controlling, many being far more driven for their work (not put off it as I am by a lack of choice, driven to seek relaxation and developing a lazy attitude) or far happier and in far better relationships with their parents because of such freedom given to them. I am truly sorry that I lied to you, I tried not to as much as possible believe me please, for example simply refusing to tell you my ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äôs‚Äô name rather than lie again and create a web of deceit. Yet no matter how hard I try to be a noble and moral Christian I am subject to sin like any other, and fear is a great motivator for vice.
&gt;
I am profusely sorry for the next paragraph, but it is time to call you out for things done. With tears in my eyes I type these words, because it hurts me greatly to imagine the pain they may bring, yet also the sadness at the fear that you may ignore them. I do not love you anymore. I appreciate your great and good intentions, but they have left me with nothing but a lack of love which I never had filled until now, which again, out of your good intentions you have tried to destroy by cutting me from the man I love.
And that is a perfect example. The best intentions come to naught unless the actions they are offered through are themselves good. Every person I have known has turned to me - some with firsthand experience - and called what I suffer abuse. I kept saying ‚ÄúNo, my parents love me, everything they do is of good intention‚Äù, but now I have to accept that abusive love is still abuse, no matter how loving. I haven‚Äôt said these things to you because you won‚Äôt listen, and I can‚Äôt say them now face to face because I physically can‚Äôt!
Mom, Dad, maybe you are blind, but I‚Äôm mentally a wreck. Teachers tell me, friends tell me, the councillor tells me this. I am an emotional failure. The only people I ever loved ‚Äì you ‚Äì have controlled my life, and done so out of just intentions, leaving me with no way to do anything or complain at the treatment without a deep painful feeling of guilt, creating a self hatred which is so bad that I take blame for all problems in my life; I now have a guilt complex which is deeply upsetting for all around me, [boyfriend] and [cousin] and my friends all separately sat me down, all disconnected occurrences, and told me I had this. I myself denied it, claiming it was my entire fault and not any others! Because how could someone as pathetic as you make me feel, blaming me for everything, be anything but the cause of all problems? I know you won‚Äôt believe me, claim I am hyperbolising, overreacting, or even just over thinking... I genuinely believe I am pathetic, so much so that I hurt myself to punish, to atone, for all my sins; this self flagellantism which scars me not physically but emotionally (which I would call worse as all but the most horrible injuries heal across all humans, we have a fairly constant metabolism, while mental scars are not only hidden, but may not heal as assuredly), for example I have cut myself off from others, having no friends until recently because I legitimately feel I am so worthless no one loves me, and that if they did, I did not deserve them ‚Äì I mean who is noble that does not feel unconditional love to his parents? An idea you won‚Äôt stop forcing on my mind like a cancer, gnawing away at my confidence and fuelling this self hatred. 
&gt;
I have no confidence to the point I cannot say these things to you, because when I open up you shout me down every single time. It is why as I said I lie sometimes, because how can one stay to the truth when you hate it more than the lies? But back to my original point; I don‚Äôt love you anymore. You have destroyed my confidence, made me self loathing, given me a guilt complex, the talking to myself as you do (also perhaps a substitute for a lack of friends, yet then why do I still do it when I now have them? Does it matter? Both conclusions fall at your feet), severe introversy, OCD (and do not dare to claim that you think I am not, I know my body, I know the obsession, the constant reversals, on and off the lights go, ten minutes arranging pencils on a desk, an hour shutting a door and opening it. I hide it from you, but does that make it not real? It seems your controlling attitude has rubbed off), perhaps even insomnia if I am to believe the councillors hypothesis on that lack of sleep. Frankly, and I am sorry you hate swearing; I never swear usually (surely the use of curses only shows you how much this affects me?), but you have frankly fucked up my mind and personality to the point [cousin] and the councillor both think I should be on medication. A notion I reject entirely, the idea of repressing who I am rather than fighting to overcome them as [boyfriend] agrees... but what I intended to say was that they are both deeply stressed, how can I feel that [cousin], my cousin, is so hurt because of the way I am? That the two people I did once love ‚Äì you two ‚Äì go and do this to me? You wonder why I cannot bring myself to love you; I cannot trust or be close to anyone ‚Äì [boyfriend] suffers because of it, I couldn‚Äôt even trust him! I do now, but 6 months, 6 months! 6 months of paranoia, terrified fear that he would hurt me like you have, like everyone I had loved has, because you screwed with my mind so badly that I cannot love properly. If you don‚Äôt believe me, ask him, ask [cousin], ask anyone who knows my dark thoughts and has seen my introversy.
I only have friends thanks to [boyfriend], he gave me confidence to start talking, I couldn‚Äôt talk in calls with him if someone else was there, and even now I am very quiet. Instead of the restraining order you threatened us with, you could thank him for fixing a problem you refused to fix. I wouldn‚Äôt be at a friend‚Äôs house now hiding, waiting for you to read this and have time to think, if it weren‚Äôt for him. Yet still! Still I am not fixed, still I am too shy, too nervous, too scared.
I am infuriated by my introversy, you cannot understand the pain, it is almost imprisonment, incarcerated within my own mind, my voice padlocked and closed to my screaming thoughts. They are yearning hysterically to be free, to be voiced to others. It is agony to be too scared to say hello to someone, do you know the feeling? It is the feeling when you want to do something, say something, but can‚Äôt. You have cowed me, granting me this curse, one that [boyfriend] helps me break, and you try to stop him?! But then again‚Ä¶ Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand, why would you seek to undo what you have done?
&gt;
There are thousands of other problems I have, which reduce me daily to tears at school, at home; behind closed doors as again I cannot show you my pain. But I will not mention them in such detail. To mention them would only achieve quilting you, and I aim to be no hypocrite.
I hate to say Freud was right, as I said earlier I always rejected the idea my emotional scars were your fault, claiming it was me; that I simply couldn‚Äôt handle life, that I was childish and would get over them; but [boyfriend], [cousin], my teachers, my friends, my councillor.. they all showed me that I have only gotten worse, that these pains have only deepened over the years, they made me, even having to force me to sit down and stop blaming myself, that there is a cause for hang ups. And no matter how delicately I sweeten what you do with positive imagery, I cannot deny what you do! If anything, the fact I do just proves the point that I am too self loathing, submissive, with guilt complexes and the fear of disappointing you.
&gt;
There is no hate in these words, no slow or tempered anger. Only sadness at the loss of love that could be between us, and perhaps, disappointment - yet that last emotion is in quantum superposition, it could be or could not, that all depends on whether you reject and ignore these words or try to understand how you have hurt me, and how I wish for reconciliation, but more importantly how I am in love with [boyfriend]. diligamus nos.

As I understand the term, bisexual would mean that one is attracted to men and woman. Nothing else, just those two. This could include people that were born (fe)male and later had surgery to become fe(male), but wouldn't include those who do not identify as either a man or a woman. To those who ask why I would limit it like that, I say that *I* didn't, that is what the word means. That isn't a bad thing, or a good thing, it is just a definition. Honestly, I'm glad that that *is* the definition, since I believe there are many people that would and do happily fall under that definition. When I was younger, I identified as bi, because it was all I knew that corresponded to my attractions. I would probably have said that I was only capable of being attracted to the standard male and female definitions. Now I know differently, but there are people that still feel that way. They deserve to have that recognized, and not be forced into a label that doesn't describe them.

There is another word, pansexual, that means one has the potential to be attracted both emotionally and physically, to anyone of any gender identification. I'm glad that word exists too, because the definition of bisexual doesn't fit for many people. Those who feel that bisexual is too confining, or narrow, or just not right, they deserve their own word. I don't understand why people keep trying to say that pan=bi=pan when clearly the need for both exists. 

I'm 99% sure I'm pan. 99% because there are some who say that pan means that gender and sex are irrelevant to attraction, and I can't say that. I have been attracted to at least one person of every gender variant I've had the priviledge to meet, at least partially *because* of their gender. I love women, and I love men, and I love everything between and beside them. That having been said, there are those who *don't* care about, or even really see the point *in* caring about gender/physical sex. They are pan. So am I. Though there is that 1% that says to me ""but you ***do*** see and care about gender, so you aren't pan"" I say, yes I do, and that is ok. Pan is a much more fluid term than bi, and I'm glad to have found it.

I have some hangups with labels but I must find other people who experience one love. (5),"I have been perplexed about my sexuality lately, so please hear me out. I am a 25 year, openly gay, cis-male. Before coming out when I was 18, I had (and enjoyed ) multiple sexual experiences with both male identified and female identified people. I never considered myself bi when coming out due to what I perceived as a taboo in the LGBTQ culture surrounding bisexuals. This past year I dated a Trans-male and had no qualms about his gender identity. I am not asking if this group would label me as pansexual, because that decision falls solely upon myself. I must confess that I carry a lot of guilt surrounding my sexuality, this guilt does not come from my Heterosexual friends, this guilt comes from within the LGBTQ community (primarily other gay cismales). I am in search of other like minded individuals because I understand the importance of a strong support group.

Struggling with identity.,"Hello all!

I've been struggling a bit in the last couple of weeks with my identity in many. I'm a woman and recently I have started to discover the joys of dressing in an androgynous way. I still love being femme some days, but I  feel like dressing in more unisex clothes a lot recently.

I've also fine tuned my sexuality a little bit. I still identify as pansexual, but I'm definitely starting to lean towards women and androgynous people. The catch? I'm in a long term relationship with a heterosexual man who I love and am definitely attracted to, and I could see us getting married and staying together. On one hand I'm a little worried that I'm going to ""miss out"" on experiences, but I definitely am not willing to give up such a great relationship to do it.

I'm sort of conflicted, because I don't know how much of this is the cis white able-bodied middle-class straight-passing female saying ""I want to be oppressed too!"", and how much is me actually feeling a bit lost. I'm going to my first queer collective meeting today, so hopefully that will help.

Questions about identifying as pansexual,"I don't really identify as anything in particular right now. If I *had* to label what I identify as something right now, I would probably say I feel closest to Pansexual. However, I'm still very confused as to what exactly it is.

From what I understand, if you're bisexual, you are attracted to 2 genders, Male and Female. But if you're pansexual, you can be attracted to people of all gender identities.

And I know within bisexuality it does not have to be a 50/50 split of attraction, you can like one gender more than the other and still identify as bi. Does this also apply to the pansexual identity? If I prefer those who identify as female, but can still honestly see myself falling in love with someone from any other gender identity in the future if they were the right person for me, does that still fall under the umbrella of pansexuality?

And I've heard it being a term to describe that people are attracted to the person only, not their physical appearance at all, but...physical appearance is very important to me. If I'm not physically attracted to you, then a relationship just won't work no matter how compatible we are personality-wise.

Basically this is a big wall of text to find out whether I would encounter problems with people disagreeing if I openly used the term pansexual to describe my identity right now.",pansexual

Let's just all get wallet-sized versions of this.,,pansexual
"So, I Recently Came Out and Told my Parents...","I guess it all depends on whether not your family is okay with people who aren't heterosexual, but I can say that the conversation could've gone worse. My mum was pretty accepting and asked a few questions like these: ""So, you're Bisexual? You're not sure of which gender you prefer?""
My dad said this: ""She's not there yet; she's just confused of what she's more attracted to - she'll come around.""
My sister asked: ""How was Narnia?""
Of course, other than scoff at my sister, I made sure to firmly explain that, &gt; no, I am not confused and I'll never be ""physically"" attracted to people based on their looks. I've known this for a while now and know you deserve the right to know. I stressed the ""not confused"" part. Several times, because my dad seems to think it's just a phase, even if I told him no.
Coming out was probably the most terrifying moment of my life, but my mum acknowledged the fact that I was brave to do so. My mum and sister support me, and understood; my dad looks a bit less happy about it.

My point is this: coming out is scary, and depending of your family's relationship and beliefs, it can be the worst thing. I've seen that, in my little time on Reddit, that there are quite a few people who don't know how to come out as per se, but my advice is this: if you know they will reject you, make sure you're not dependent of them (in other words, make sure you've moved out.) If they're open to that and are comfortable around people like that, you can tell them! Just don't say ""I think I might be pansexual."" The words ""think"" and ""might"" trigger a thought: *It's just a phase.* Be sure to explain to them what a pansexual is, and make sure they don't think you're physically attracted to pans! This is exactly what I said:

&gt; Please listen to what I have to say, and please take me seriously. I'm a pansexual - I'm not physically attracted to pans. I look past physical appearance and am more attracted to the person *within* the body, so that's why whenever someone asks me if this guy is hot I say *Yes, in their own way, but I'm the wrong person to ask,* because I'm not attracted to someone's looks. I am not bisexual: bisexuals also take into note the *physical* appearance, whereas I do not. I would not care if my lifetime partner was male, female or transvestite. I thought you guys should know, so that you wouldn't be surprised if one day I came home with a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend.

My mum's jaw dropped and she even snuffed her cigarette out. My dad looked... a little ill-at-ease, but he's homophobic so I think this was a shock to him. My sister teased me, which tells me she's okay with it.

I expect lots of questions from my family now regarding my sexuality, but it feels nice to have that off my shoulders. I feel free.

It's the most frightening thing, coming out, but it's liberating.",pansexual
Newly-discovered pansexual. Parents weird about it. Have a boyfriend and things are complicated.,"So a while ago I discovered that beautiful blog, [25 Things about My Sexuality](http://25thingsaboutmysexuality.blogspot.com/). One of my friends was really into it, told me to post, and was rather shocked by how depressing and unsexy my entry was.

But my own sad little contribution got me to thinking about the role I had thought I was to fulfill. Sure, you can like boys and girls, sure, you'll go to college, but you'll have a family no matter the mom:dad ratio, have a job and keep your spouse content. Congratulations on your sexual freedom! The menu has expanded to Choice A and Choice B.

I feel that most of you at some point came to the conclusion that even this massive accomplishment (look! A SAME-SEX COUPLE FILLING A TRADITIONAL ROLE. GADZOOKS) still feels a bit restrained.

So, parents. They have long suspected me to to be a lesbian. Until I got a boyfriend I was faced with frequent supportive talks and casual references to the GSA. Rare, mocking, and casual references. Doesn't mean my mother doesn't burn my gay porn and drag queen posters as she finds them, and my father checks my closed door every hour to make sure I'm not ""napping"" (see, ""jilling off"").

Sex is funny where I come from, but if you admit to enjoying it, Christ, you get the book thrown at you.

And I'm in Seattle! Luck of the draw.

I'm eighteen and unemployed, not to mention a bit of a financial dipstick, (charities are drugs) making moving out no realistic option. Boyfriend thinks I'm a lesbian trapped in a straight girl's body. I do like the dick, I must say, but I also quite admire the feminine physique.

And everything in-between.

With my latest self-realization, I've come into a hard place, one of a strong desire to experiment but a crippling shyness that overrides even normal small talk, and the firm belief that even kissing another person outside of my rather vanilla coexistence with my brawny beau is an absolute taboo.

Maybe if there were some equality in this relationship, it would be better, but as is, he is strictly hetero, rather inexperienced, and only likes to see me with women. This guy is a good deal of my world, so it's not like I'm anywhere near leaving him for a couple of failed encounters and missed opportunities.

I might be lamenting over nothing. There's also a bit of fear with my family, who are less than democratic on matters of sexual freedom when it doesn't involve cheating on one's wife.

My goal is to, some day, share a passionate kiss with a female impersonator. My best friend is dating a crossdresser and loves it. I've put sweet chapstick on my guy. And maybe plucked five eyebrow hairs before he ~~runs crying~~ makes a dignified exit. It's a bit demoralizing.

I am Pansexual and my girlfriend is Trans (male to female). Does anyone have any advice on coming-out? ,"We have been dating for 4 years. I used to always think I was bisexual (since 7th grade). As time went on I got to know other bisexuals, but I always knew there was something different about them in comparison to me. I went on a hunt to find out what it could possibly be. I did research into different sexual orientations and things of that nature and learned of Pansexual. After I read it, I knew that's exactly what I am. 

Soon after figuring that out I started dating my ""boyfriend"". I never told ""him"" that I was pansexual. I didn't think ""he"" would like it. Two years into our relationship she told me she was transgender and that she will soon be transitioning. She thought that I would leave her for sure, but she didn't know I was pansexual. This event really put my pansexuality to the test. I told her right away that there would be no heartbreak because I love her, no matter what. 

Very soon she would like to start transitioning. Obviously, I can't keep my sexual orientation a secret from my family much longer. My girlfriend told her mother in December and she flipped out and basically disowned both of us... :( I really don't want this to happen again. My parents and family are much more reasonable than her, but I still can't be sure how they will react. Please, I need all the advice I can get. I don't want to lose my family. They mean so much to me.

Edit: I told my sister two weeks ago. She was totally ok with it. She has the same worries as me about the rest of the family. All of them are religious (I am an atheist and they know this already). Some are more religious than others. My uncle, for example, will not let his children watch Ellen because he thinks it will ""turn them gay"" ???? So I already know he will not be ok with it. My grandparents, however, are ok with gay people and ok with gay marriage. I am hoping that I will at least come out of all of this with some allies.

Edit: I just told my cousin last night. She is from a very religious family, but she is also the relative that I am closest with, so I had to. She was completely accepting!! She says that she disagrees with her father that it is a choice. She is going to help me come out the rest of the family when that time comes.

I wound up explaining to him that, at the time, I considered myself bi because I think both men and women physically atractive ( but not sexually) but I would rather look at a women.
Now, the part I have trouble explaining to him is that I'm not sexually attracted to anyone (in general). I didn't ever plan on having sex actually, the idea didn't hold any interest for me. So even though I think women look better than men, I would rather avoid seeing naked women. 
He can't grasp this concept. It gets even harder for him to understand when I try to explain that I don't find him physically attractive, or didn't.

Maybe I should start out with a little background.
I am 17, and a girl. Yes, I know this is young, but I've been told by many that I am far mature for my age. I've been in a relationship with a boy for over half a year, but for the past.. roughly 5 months, there has been little to no sexual activity involved - on my part.

I've never experienced anything with a woman before, except for this somewhat odd makeout session with a girl when I was way younger, and I don't quite remember it. ANYWAYS, so I'm in this relationship where I love the guy but don't in bed, and finding myself more and more attracted to a woman.. dressed up as a man? Does that make sense? I'm so confused. Don't get me wrong, I think guys are .. nice-looking and whatnot, but I just don't *feel* it.

My school is full of judgemental bigots and I have to deal with haters fairly often. So, here's what happened today; I was walking from one school building from another, when the local group of inbreds decided to cat-call me. I was called a dyke 7 times in under 10 seconds. (New record! Woo!) My moment of win came when I turned to them and said ""Well, I'm sorry that you're jealous that I get more pussy than you guys! It's not like I can help it!"" The looks on their faces made my entire week, and I think that it has actually made me more comfortable with being who I am! :) So have any of you had moments like this? ",pansexual

Am I Pansexual?,"Okay, here goes. I am a thirteen year old female and have always wondered what I am in sexuality wise. When I get older, I want to have a relationship with someone. But I'm the sort of person that really doesn't care about looks/gender. I would fall in love with someone based on how they treat me and on their personality. I wouldn't mind dating a man or woman or any other gender identity there is, as long as they love me I'm willing to love them. But the problem is - I wouldn't really like to have a sexual relationship with a female. Maybe if I dated a female one day, I'd just learn to get used to it, but being friends with gay men for a long time has made the vagina a disturbing thought for me - Even though I have one. I wish I didn't sometimes. But basically, am I pansexual if I wouldn't mind having a relationship with any one as long as they love me, even if I'm not sexually attracted to the female genitalia?",pansexual

On the importance of sexual relations,"I feel as though I only have sex with people because I can see that it makes them happy. I am a biological male with effeminate tendencies.

choosing the heterosexual norm? ,"throw away account time. 
I came out as a lesbian almost a decade ago, having given up on fighting my attraction to women. I had dated all different types of cis-males ranging from effeminate to metro to tough-guy masculine. I was genuinely attracted to all of them. I began dating women, and found myself attracted to a variety of body projections there as well, from butch to fem to feminist to straight. I honestly believed that I was a lesbian in the strictest terms, but it became clear to me after some time that it was not the case. Now I'm in a heterosexual relationship. We're monogamous and committed, and honestly I really love him. He is a great person inside and out.
My fear is that my strong sexual desires and attractions to a large variety of people is going to cause me enough stress that I won't be able to remain in the relationship no matter how well it's going. I am sexually and emotionally satisfied, but, to put it bluntly, I'm thrilled to be getting the cock, but I desperately miss the pussy. I'm not going to ask for an open relationship because I don't want him sleeping with anyone else, so it would be completely unfair and he deserves my devotion. To be honest, I only ever get stressed about it when I consider 1) that I might be ""giving in to societal pressure"" or 2) never having another lady on my face again. It's more anxiety driven than anything else. Does anyone else struggle with this when their partner turns out to be... ""normal""?

Different flag / symbolism?,"While I know some people rather like the flag/colors representing pansexuality, I personally do not. I've taken to the color green as being representative of my own pansexuality. Would anyone else happen to share my viewpoint on the colors?",pansexual
I'm a tad bit confused,"I'm attracted to all genders. Like, someone's gender doesn't matter at all to me when I find someone attractive, but I'm still attracted to their physical appearance although personality is a bigger factor (of course). I never really understood what it meant to be pansexual so I thought it was just being attracted to someone's peronality rather than appearance.
for example, I find some traits unattractive like super muscular bodybuilders, but some traits attractive like people with dyed hair (like pink) so would that just make me polysexual since I'm not attracted to everyone?

So,  even though I still find certain people physically attractive, would that make me pansexual?",pansexual
Why are pansexuals attracted to personality over appearance?,"Sometimes when I say I'm pansexual I hear, ""But you discriminate based on looks, you aren't pansexual!""

I've never understood why pansexuality meant something more specific than other sexualities. When I say pansexual I simply mean I'm attracted to all genders, why does it also have to mean that I don't have preferences? If I were say, a heterosexual female, I'd still be considered heterosexual if I preferred men with facial hair. Why can't I be pansexual but prefer partners that look a certain way?

Similarly, what does gender-blind mean? I know that could be its own post, but I see it as being connected to this topic so I figured asking it here made sense.

Also, I know not everyone thinks that way about pansexuality. I just want those that do to explain it to me.",pansexual
What does pansexual mean to you?,"I've recently been told that my definition of pansexual is ""wrong"". I don't think that it is, and I think that words that get used as identity labels mean a lot of different things to different people, and that that is normal and good. Just because we identify with the same word doesn't mean our sexualities are the same because, well, **nobody's** sexuality is exactly the same as anyone else's.  

So I was wondering, what does the label 'pansexual' mean to the people of /r/pansexual?
No links to dictionary definitions please, I am looking for information on people's individual relationships with the word. 

Here's mine:

I am not of binary gender and I am not comfortable with a term which implies that the gender is binary, which is why I use the term pansexual instead. I don't think that I am ""gender blind"" as I definitely find certain gender expressions more attractive than others (eg androgyny). But physical sex and gender identity are not things which affect whether I might be attracted to someone, and so pansexual works well for me I think. ",pansexual
How I conceptualise sexuality,,pansexual
I kinda get the feeling...,"That mono sexuality isn't really the way it's supposed to work.

Well, sexually perhaps, you know to further the species and stuff, but not for recreation(which is most sex) or romantically. I don't deny the exist of heterosexuality at all, or find it morally questionable, but I just wonder, how is it that you can be so, limited, in those whom you can love?

I find it odd that there are so many people to love anywhere on the spectrum, but that it's only normal to find it in one. What is [/r/pansexuals](/r/pansexuals) take on it? Also, I'm kind of posting because this sub-reddit is criminally inactive.",pansexual
Best way to come out to family?,"I've known that I'm pansexual for awhile, and most of my friends know i am, but my family doesn't know and i just don't know the right way to come out to them. Anything helpful would be nice. c: ",pansexual
Just feeling...confused.,"Hello, all.
Where to begin? I guess I should state that I'm nearly 18, and in September, I started to seriously question my sexuality. 
I had struggled with my sexuality all through middle school, but my family is strictly Christian and against any sort of homosexuality, so I blocked it out of my mind and told myself my desires for a girl were sinful and that I could make myself not feel that way.
I still consider myself a Christian, but I really won't go into why I'm cool with LGBTQ. It's not what I came here for.
So, when I began to realize that I may not be straight, I deeply searched myself and thought I had discovered that I was bisexual, and came out to only a couple of close friends. I accepted that I would have to keep quiet about my sexuality to my family, knowing I would be out of the house sometime in my twenties. In December I learned of the term ""pansexual"" and what it meant. I didn't particularly think much of it until I really thought about the people I feel attracted to.
I like people who identify as men. I like people who identify as women. I like people who identify as neither. I like people who identify as both. I like people who identify as something else entirely. I like transgenders and transexuals.
I can't say anything except that I feel utterly confused. Am I jumping to quickly to say that I'm this or that? Should I ignore labels completely and just love? It's been something weighing heavily on my mind and I suppose I just needed to tell somebody who would actually understands. My friends are open-minded, but I'm quite sure they would question my confusion.
Thanks for reading, friends, I'm sorry if it's a little messy.",pansexual
"Standard 'fairly sure I am, please confirm for me' post","So I'm an owner of ovaries and have known for a while that I can be sexually attracted to both men and woman. I first realized while sitting in a history class nine years ago when a curvacious classmate walked up to turn in an assignment and I ended up distractedly captivated by the sway of her hips. Without questioning myself even for a moment I just blinked and went *Oh, so I guess I'm bi then. That's cool.*

Moving on a few years, I obtained my very first real life boyfriend. I was never sexually attracted to his body, however, I was extremely attracted to his intellect and wit. We had almost everything in common. We both loved gaming, reading, writing, the same sort of movies et cetera blah blah. Through these common interests I became attracted to him in a sexual way. I suppose I was beginning to get off on brain power.

Things didn't work out and eventually I end up with my now current girlfriend, a fellow gamer/redditor/artist. This woman actually does get my gears going in both a sexual and intellectual way. I realized through her that I am attracted to a little something inbetween being in that I like small breasts on women. Along with that for males I seem to prefer to ogle over twinkish individuals.

I know the general definition of pansexual deems males, females and transgendered as the grounds for liking... but I sort of feel like the original depiction of Jack Harkness from Doctor Who. Human, alien, whatever it doesn't really matter so long as there is some sort of sentient bond. I'm the sorta person who gets off Liara because of the whole Asari mind-sex thing (Er, dorked out there for a second, my apologies.) Anyway, I suppose that's where I get my slight confusion. Just not sure if Pansexual is the apt term for me.

tl;dr I find myself sexually attracted to people through common interests and intellect. I also seem to like gender neutral looks in a person. Am I pansexual?",pansexual
"Genderfluid, and wondering what I am.","***This post mirrored, with appropriate modifications, to /r/Bisexual, /r/LGBT***

I have a rather unique situation really and I do have a few questions to ask.

* Some days I feel more feminine than others, and with this comes the associated feminine urges. Of course this tends to rise and fall with how I feel, is that normal? Does this make me Pansexual or just some other way? *I certainly don't wish to begin identifying as Pan without being somewhat validated by others of that nature, I don't wish to offend.*

* Sometimes I simply feel so feminine I dig into leftover Halloween makeup or use sharpies, whichever is at hand, to ""beautify"" myself. Now rationally speaking I consider this self-entertainment for extreme boredom, I am an unemployed full-time college student, but I wonder if I should experiment with REAL makeup full-time, not just putting on some makeup when I'm in my room alone. If so, I'd like to know which types of makeup I should wear and such. I do have my ears pierced. (I am a guy, but to be honest some days I'd just -like- to try looking a little girly or softer if you know what I mean)

* I've considered transitioning between genders, but I feel like that I'm fine with what I am so long as I can simply find a way to openly express how I feel like both genders at times. I'm 23 now, but I've felt this way since I was at least 16 or 17, before then I simply was a bit of a homo/biphobe...and totally denying what I was hardcore. Currently I feel like I'm not going to transition...I wouldn't have any support for it anyway from my family and to be honest, it seems more trouble than it's worth.

* I am a virgin, but that doesn't mean I'm *just curious,* I've made my decision for now, and I'm asking these questions in order to help myself refine how I should express what I am to others so I can make what I am perfectly clear. I haven't exactly ""Come out"" yet...I don't plan to, I believe that someone's sexual orientation is not something that needs to be discussed with anyone other than friends or people you are romantically interested in. This doesn't mean I won't tell people who come up to ask me what my orientation is if I find them interesting.* At the current time I claim myself as Bi, but sometimes I wonder if I don't fit into the Pansexual grid somewhere.*

* I live in a Bible Belt state, Texas, so please keep this in mind when making your suggestions, What might be perfectly fine in So. Cal. might not go unnoticed here, and draw unwanted hateful attention. I don't wish to be flaming and flamboyant about it, I just want it to be subtly obvious to other LGBT parties so they can at least approach me comfortably if they really seem interested in me. 

* I tend to be a little fickle, I certainly don't find myself developing crushes on random people, usually I only ever crush on someone if I've met them, and befriended them a bit at least. I don't have to make full on biffles or anything, but seriously it's been a bit of a problem with me, especially when I'm online...I find myself falling for friends and that makes for some very awkward losses of friends. I certainly sometimes get a little *too affectionate* with friends I feel close to, and that has made for some very awkward situations as well. x3

* I once got to know a pan online, and believe it or not I simply naturally looked up to her. She transitioned across the genders too, but I couldn't help but feel respect once I found out and I naturally quickly befriended her. Of course the previous point kicked in too, I did kinda crush on her, but I was able to talk it out with her with no serious loss of standing. it's not like I chased her much anyway...I'd learned to control my crushes by this time. This person is really the one who helped me to realize what I am. Before I was kind of in denial thinking ""Maybe it's a phase"".",pansexual
Well at least they didn't say pans... ,,pansexual
Am I bi or pan? ,"I figure you guys must get this question all the time, but I don't really know wether I'm bi or pan. I'm a cisgendered female, and from what I've heard is pansexuals don't believe in or pick partners based on the gender binary. I don't endorse the gender binary, and I don't consider sex or gender in attraction, so does that mean I'm pan? Are people who chose the label of bisexual just close-minded? I really don't care what label I turn out to fit, it won't change anything, but I'm just a little confused about which one is actually applicable. ",pansexual
Going too far? How do I know?,"I am a middle aged genderqueer. I'd qualify myself as bigendered but I am fairly pansexual. I'd qualify myself as having a good sense of self, even though in winters I tend to get a little morose. I have no major neurological disorders and other than ADHD the sole reason for me not working is largely due to fairly frequent migraines, and the odd cluster headache. 

I live near the Hague, in the Netherlands.

I have always had a extraordinary, once in a hundred sexual urge. I never bothered people with it and kept it to myself. In fact I as never outgoing and since I was married with a fairly interesting and quite pretty Goth for a decade I never looked outside marriage.

Since my divorce I am steadily coming apart. It's not that I care much about it - but I keep abandoning restraints and inhibitions one after another.  I am now in my 40s and most people who know me refer to me as a slut, and extremely kinky. What I find is that as I alienate some people (and these people have been falling away from my life in a steady stream) I become more narcistic about my lifestyle. Being judged angers me, even though it makes sense that people might find some things I do objectionable. 

Before I met my ex I could feel lonely. These days I mostly don't. It sometimes worries me that I am painting myself ever further in a corner. Not working (and not having a lot of spending cash) aggravates this - if I had a steady or bigger income I would not be having my reservations (or worries) at all - but I feel I am becoming more isolated. 

A good friend made the comment today ""do you realize how fucked up you are? I mean it's cool how liberated you are, but don't you ever have doubts?"" and I realize I don't. I am getting better at not giving a flying fuck what people think.  

This may not be as practical in the long run.

At a rational level I fear that ten years from now I might in fact find myself abandoned and utterly alone, and sexually less compelling than I am right now. Already finding playmates for my endeavors is becoming more challenging, and the quality of the playmates is becoming more casual, more dehumanizing, more disinterested in ""me"" as a human being, but only interested in how well I give head or how well I let myself get used, sexually, or how well I am able to like being whipped or sexually degraded. And many of my playmates are, well, not the brightest of the litter. And I like my playmates smart more than anything else!

I mean it's fun, but once this ends, what the hell will I be left with?

I walk off the beaten path. I walk apart from tradition, established morality, norms, normalcy and convention.  I do have amazing experiences here, far away from the established roads and familiar avenues, but I sometimes worry that I am losing touch so far from the normal, everyday, stable is making me 'weirder and weirder'. To a degree at some point I won't be able to connect with everyday life any more.

I am starting to loathe things. Everyday, bourgeois, conventionality. I can be so direct, tactless. I can be brutally honest and am losing my subtlety. And I sometimes pick fights, out of sheer obstinacy. And I am so good at expressing myself, people rather avoid any confrontations with me. 

The best solution would be having someone (M/F) that I really connect with, someone just as fundamentally artistic, and liberated and wild and fucked up as myself. Someone of my age bracket and my own pansexual interests and my own level of iconoclastic irreverence and rebellious recalcitrance that would like being with me, for a range of reasons. 

But that in itself will be far from easy.

Anyone has any suggestions? Next week I won't worry about this.. but yanno. Now I am worried.",pansexual

Could I get some information? ,"Hiya, I identify within the gender binary as a trans woman. I have a roommate who identifies as pansexual. She's attempted to explain it in the past as finding the ""spiritual energy"" of someone attractive. Not the body. While I find that confusing I have come to understand that as, ""finding the person attractive and not the body."" 

I understand that is different from what she describes, but, speaking as someone who is at best skeptical about ""spiritual energy"" that helps me wrap my head around it. That being said, I hope that is not offensive. 

Now, my question is, and I'm trying to word it carefully, her friendship matters to me. Her support does as well. Yet she often several things I find offensive about my identity as a trans woman. Discussions surrounding the gender binary, trying to convince me to be comfortable as I am, male-bodied, and stating that I should not attempt to fit myself within it. I want to fit myself within it because, well, that is who I am. It's who I want to be and it's how I feel. I'm trying to find ways where I can meet her where she is coming from and I am struggling. Could you please help me? Perhaps I don't have the vocabulary or perhaps I'm way off base. I don't know.

Does gender identity divide bisexuality and pansexuality?,"Hello, r/pansexual!

I've considered myself bisexual for a little more than a year now. Recently my SO came out to me as bigendered (a subset of transgendered in which the gender identity switches). Now I'm a little bit confused about the difference between bisexuality and pansexuality.

I've never been close to an intersex individual, so biologically, I can only attest to the fact that I like both males and females. However, I certainly like my SO's male and female identities. Furthermore, I am almost exclusively attracted to someone's personality before their appearance, so it's plausible that I could be attracted to someone who is intersex.

Would this be considered bisexuality or pansexuality? I was under the impression that bisexuality included only cisgendered males and females, but my SO thought that it would include any biological males or females, regardless of gender identity.

And please don't worry about telling me not to fret about labels. :) It doesn't matter to me whether I'm bisexual or pansexual. It's a curiosity thing, nothing more.

Thanks, guys!

Edit: Thanks again for all the answers! I guess I was confused because I thought that, as the sidebar here says, pansexuals find ""gender and sex"" irrelevant or insignificant while bisexuals found sex insignificant but not gender. There seem to be a lot of differing opinions on that! I should clarify that besides simply switching between male and female identities, my SO does also have in-between times which don't put me off at all, so I'm definitely okay outside the gender binary. So... I guess maybe I'd identify as pansexual now. :)",pansexual

Is sex a mandatory/necessary requirement for attraction/love?,"So the Omni/Pan thread prompted an odd thought for me and I wanted to see what other folks were thinking on a forwardly possible subject.

Is sex mandatory/necessary for you to be attracted to/love another entity. In other words, in theory if an AI were developed that had a sufficiently attractive personality, would/could you fall in love with it, even though you'd never be able to have intercourse?",pansexual
"Would you say, Omni-pan?","I have identified as Pansexual for years, simply due to the fact that I have attraction to people outside the Male/Female biological binaries.
But recently I have started to say ""Omni-pan"" instead, Because I know I'm not a true pansexual.

To me a pansexual is gender-blind, They don't care what's in your pants.
But I do, Sometimes  gender defines the role I wish to take in the relationship, in other cases, there are certain genders I rule out entirely.

But I'm still open to bi-gender, gender-nuteral, Trans, Intersex and cross-gendered partners, So I didn't feel comfortable saying I was Bi.

Do you feel like you experience attraction fundamentally different than most people?

When I'm out with friends in a social setting, and a buddy says ""Hey, that girl is hot!"", I can certainly decide if someone is physically attractive or not, but I never feel true attraction to someone until I get at least a glimpse of their personality, or get to know them.

When I tell my friends, ""I guess, she's cute, but I'd have to get to know her first!"" I'm always met with friendly laughter. In the same vein, if someone physically attractive ends up having a horrible personality, I really find no attraction to them anymore.
