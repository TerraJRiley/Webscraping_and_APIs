</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively, you may ignore the equipment from your class and background and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Sense"> Divine Sense </span></h2>
<p>As an action, until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lay_on_Hands"> Lay on Hands </span></h2>
<p>You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
</p><p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fighting_Style"> Fighting Style </span></h2>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Defense:</b> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
</li><li><b>Dueling:</b> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
</li><li><b>Great Weapon Fighting:</b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
</li><li><b>Protection:</b> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
</li><li><b>Close Quarters Shooter (Unearthed Arcana):</b> When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
</li><li><b>Tunnel Fighter (Unearthed Arcana):</b> As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.
</li><li><b>Mariner (Unearthed Arcana):</b> As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting"> Spellcasting </span></h2>
<p>By 2nd level, you can cast <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Paladin_Spells" title="Paladin Spells">paladin spells</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparing_and_Casting_Spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></h3>
<p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell-list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p><p>Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier
</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Focus">Spellcasting Focus</span></h3>
<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Smite"> Divine Smite </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell-level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Divine_Health"> Divine Health </span></h2>
<p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sacred_Oath"> Sacred Oath </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 9th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 20th level.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oath_Spells">Oath Spells</span></h3>
<p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity">Channel Divinity</span></h3>
<p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ability_Score_Improvement"> Ability Score Improvement </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extra_Attack"> Extra Attack </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Protection"> Aura of Protection </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Courage"> Aura of Courage </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_Divine_Smite"> Improved Divine Smite </span></h2>
<p>By 11th level, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cleansing_Touch"> Cleansing Touch </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Oath_of_the_Ancients"> Oath of the Ancients </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tenets_of_the_Ancients">Tenets of the Ancients</span></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its fair central principles are simple.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Kindle the Light:</b> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.
</li><li><b>Shelter the Light:</b> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.
</li><li><b>Preserve Your Own Light:</b> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
</li><li><b>Be the Light:</b> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity_2">Channel Divinity</span></h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Nature's Wrath:</b> As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.
</li><li><b>Turn the Faithless:</b> As an action, you can make each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to moves far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shape-shifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Warding">Aura of Warding</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Undying_Sentinel">Undying Sentinel</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Elder_Champion">Elder Champion</span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
</p><p>For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
</p>
<ul><li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.
</li><li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.
</li><li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.
</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Douse the Flame of Hope:</b> It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.
</li><li><b>Rule with an Iron Fist:</b> Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow. 
</li><li><b>Strength Above All:</b> You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Conquering Presence:</b> As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
</li><li><b>Guided Strike: </b>When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Conquest">Aura of Conquest</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate an aura while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scornful_Rebuke">Scornful Rebuke</span></h3>

<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Law:</b> The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.
</li><li><b>Loyalty:</b> Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.
</li><li><b>Courage:</b> You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?
</li><li><b>Responsibility:</b> You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity_5">Channel Divinity</span></h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Sacred Weapon:</b> As an action, for 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with a weapon of your choice (with a minimum bonus of +1).The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. if the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
</li><li><b>Turn the Unholy:</b> As an action, you can make any fiend or undead, provided that it's within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Devotion">Aura of Devotion</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Purity_of_Spirit">Purity of Spirit</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Protection_from_Evil_and_Good" title="Protection from Evil and Good">Protection from Evil and Good</a> spell.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holy_Nimbus">Holy Nimbus</span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate light. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Oath_of_Redemption"> Oath of Redemption </span></h2>
<p><sup>(Xanathar's Guide to Everything)</sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tenets_of_Redemption">Tenets of Redemption</span></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Peace:</b> Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long lasting peace.
</li><li><b>Innocence:</b> All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.
</li><li><b>Patience:</b> Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.
</li><li><b>Wisdom:</b> Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Emissary of Peace:</b> As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.
</li><li><b>Rebuke the Violent:</b> Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw.

<p>Starting at 7th level, when a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it.

</li><li>Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, it takes radiant damage equal to half the damage you take from the attack.
</li></ul>
<p>If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tenets_of_Vengeance">Tenets of Vengeance</span></h3>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fight the Greater Evil:</b> Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.
</li><li><b>No Mercy for the Wicked:</b> Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.
</li><li><b>By Any Means Necessary: </b>My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.
</li><li><b>Restitution:</b> If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity_7">Channel Divinity</span></h3>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Abjure Enemy:</b> As an action, choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until It takes any damage. While frightened,the creature's speed is 0, and It can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
</li><li><b>Vow of Enmity:</b> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relentless_Avenger">Relentless Avenger</span></h3>
<p>By 7th level, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Soul_of_Vengeance">Soul of Vengeance</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Avenging_Angel">Avenging Angel</span></h3>
<p>At 20th level, using your action, you undergo a transformation.
</p><p>For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
</p>
<ul><li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.
</li><li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeeded on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.
</li></ul>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Breaking_Your_Oath"> Breaking Your Oath </span></h2>
<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares their faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker or Treachery paladin.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oathbreaker">Oathbreaker</span></h3>
<p><sup>(Dungeon Master's Guide)</sup>
</p><p>A paladin must be evil and at least 3rd level to become an Oathbreaker. The paladin replaces the features specific to their Sacred Oath with Oathbreaker features.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Channel_Divinity_8">Channel Divinity</span></h4>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Control Undead:</b> As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature they can see within 30 feet of them. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin's level is immune to this effect.
</li><li><b>Dreadful Aspect:</b> As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin's choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.
</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Hate">Aura of Hate</span></h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, the paladin, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of the paladin, gains a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to the paladin's Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.
</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supernatural_Resistance">Supernatural Resistance</span></h4>
<p>At 15th level, the paladin gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Dread_Lord">Dread Lord</span></h4>
<p>At 20th level, the paladin can, as an action, surround themselves with an aura of gloom that lasts for 1 minute. The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures they choose in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.
</p><p>While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on their turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin's Charisma modifier.
</p><p>After activating the aura, the paladin can't do so again until they finish a long rest.

<ul><li><b>Conjure Duplicate:</b> As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn't occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.
</li><li><b>Poison Strike:</b> As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your paladin level, or 20 + your paladin level if you had advantage on the attack roll.
</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura_of_Treachery">Aura of Treachery</span></h4>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura of discord, which gives you the following benefits.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Cull the Herd:</b> You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.
</li><li><b>Treacherous Strike:</b> If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll that attack against a creature of your choice that is also within 5 feet of the attacker. The ability fails and is wasted if the attacker is immune to being charmed. You can use this ability three times. You regain expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Blackguard.27s_Escape">Blackguard's Escape</span></h4>
<p>At 15th level, immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Icon_of_Deceit">Icon of Deceit</span></h4>
<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
</p>
<ul><li>You are invisible.
</li><li>If a creature damages you on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to your spell save DC) or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.
</li><li>If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your paladin level.
</li></ul>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
