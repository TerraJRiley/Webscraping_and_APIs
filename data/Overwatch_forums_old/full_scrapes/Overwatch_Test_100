"Hi everyone, We've continued to see a heavy influx of conversations revolving around today's hero balance updates impacting Mercy. In an effort to consolidate feedback and create a consistent location for users to share their impressions or opinions, please use this thread. MercyValkyrieNo longer makes Resurrect instantNo longer grants a bonus Resurrect chargeThe speed bonus Guardian Angel receives when activating Valkyrie has been decreased by 50%Duration reduced from 20 seconds to 15 secondsDeveloper Comments: Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her, but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes. Additionally, we’re toning back the amount of mobility Valkyrie provides through Guardian Angel and reducing its duration to overall reduce the power of this ability.We appreciate your feedback, as it will assist us and provide insight on improving your Overwatch experience.

We recognize that people were having fun with the exploit but it caused server instability and negatively impacted other players which is why we have removed it. We really want to bring functionality like this to Overwatch and we’re doing research now into how we can support these custom game settings.

"Hi everyone, We wanted to take some time to explain the recent movement changes in depth (with examples). Hopefully this will help everyone better understand what changed, and what did not.Incline Changes:There were two persistent issues with movement on inclines that we wanted to clean up.First, while moving diagonally on inclines you would end up being slightly strafed left or right even if you were only attempting to move forward. This can be a subtle source of aiming issues for many people, and now the player will properly move forward in this situation.  Second, movement up and down inclines had inconsistent speed as compared to the ground. Running both up and down an incline would be faster than walking on flat ground.  However faster movement (e.g. McCree’s Combat Roll) would be slower when going up and down inclines. Having consistent character movement speed is important for many reasons, the biggest of which is it allows you to be able to reliably know how to aim your hitscan shots or lead your projectile fire.Acceleration changes:The characters in Overwatch have a fixed acceleration (how fast they can change their movement velocity) depending on if they are in the air or on the ground.  Previously, this amount would get reduced if you were attempting to change your direction by 90 degrees or less, and was more pronounced if you were going faster than normal (e.g. Winston’s Jump Pack or Doomfist’s Rocket Punch). One of the consequences of this was that if you were in the air travelling forward and wanted to move directly right, you could reach full speed to the right faster if you accelerated backwards to a full stop and then moved to the right, as opposed to simply pressing to the right. Having to do a non-intuitive movement to reach your desired direction as fast as possible is less than ideal, so we made a change to allow you to more consistently use the air acceleration you already had to reach the direction you'd like to be moving in.The new acceleration can feel like momentum is no longer conserved like before, but the forward velocity is just more efficiently being converted into sideways velocity. The direction is changing faster but your overall speed isn’t being slowed down.  Examples: If you're flying as Pharah, you can now just press forward and you will properly accelerate moving forward, instead of having to counter accelerate to stop sideways drift. If you’re leaping as Winston, you can more effectively redirect your velocity around corners. Prior to this rework it was possible to achieve similar mid-air turns by always facing your current velocity while strafing, but this was also unintuitive.You can now press forward and right directional inputs after a Winston leap and you will actually move some to the right, whereas previously you would have to only hold right if you wanted to get any acceleration to the right.It does mean getting used to the new strafing power. No longer do you have to hold strafe for a long time to get a small adjustment to your movement, you can simply short hold or tap it as needed, and pressing forward with a left or right command will do smaller adjustments than if pressing left or right alone.This does not substantially affect movement when trying to change movement direction by >90 degrees.Additionally, left and right strafing on the ground and air will be the same along with attempting to accelerate against a knockback will be the same.We’re keeping an eye on these changes to make sure everything is working correctly. Any feedback would be appreciated, and would be especially helpful with any screenshots or videos.","

"Hmm, so it doesn't sound like it's too impactful for heroes just jumping up and down to avoid being shot, which is good. Don't think people would accept a Genji buff, as he primarily goes left-right-left-right during battles, and that's >90.","

Possibly if players wished to do something other than 2/2/2 they could select other options like 1/3/2.This system seems to work in other role/class based games and I feel like it would greatly decrease toxicity and encourage players to play other roles (DPS would probably have a slightly longer que).Im posting this idea to receave feedback and possibly be noticed.","

"- His play style favors pushing a team around them, her's is about making a   blockade around her.  I.E. He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.  Orisa shield 900 health, CD.Both have their purposes and usage, so I see both as interchangeable depending on the team needs and situations.","

"i stopped playing Comp when your SR effects your QP match making. I noticed that smurff accounts with almost NO gametime are winding up on QP, with an SR rating similar to mine. I made the motion to STOP climbing with my SR because of my direct feelings of Discrimination in Comp. Comp is very ""grey"" in color with no diversity. I thought this game was about diversity, comp does NOT reflect these same values that blizzard states they are about. I watched on youtube,  their Director of game design and their voice actor hiring person talk about diversity in this game and how important it was to blizzard. However since Comp does not respect this business model. I have silently protested this season for this reason.The other reason is, we are given SR only based upon w/L, which means are outcome has been pre-determined by blizzard, BEFORE we started the game. I should be awarded for efforts, NOT win/Loss. I don't know of ANY game out there, other than overwatch that does this.For example: Blizzard determines the best team for you to match with, the player skill rating for them is good. However 2 or 3 of these randomly at will, these players decide that spending 90% of the time T-bagging someone in the comp-match is a better use of their time. Guess what, you just lost the game and not because you chose to. No matter how hard you played, those 2 or 3 players that are bagging around, have costed you, your game! ""so report them"". Yeah thats great, they get banned, I still get the loss and the penalty.","

That being said, it's not always easy to get others online to play with you as everyone has different schedules and ect. There's apps and stuff online that you can use to find others to play with as a team. If that's not up your alley though, then just try the best your can.

"02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonHi, I'm here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a player can have: Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little, and it seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Throughout the entire Christmas Event, I kept trying to get some new skins that I liked (Like Hanzos and Soldiers) but in the end, I got ALL the Voicelines, sprays, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes (Except Orisas). No new skins at all.02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonit seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Same happened in the Summer Games ;-;","

"02/20/2018 10:08 AMPosted by Akigokubut isnt it the flankers job to kill the supports??More like deal with supports; not be easy kills.Why I prefer the Medic from TF2. His weapon wasn't the strongest, BUT could still punish bad plays on people trying to flank (Mostly Scout)This game, the flanker characters have so many escapes and tools to make the fight THEIRS that it's insane to me to think that any support should have such weak self defense tools.If you engage on a Moira in an enclosed space, you should die.If you engage on an Ana with both cooldowns up, you should die. But that isn't the case in this game. Support characters should feel powerful and impactful; they're the ones who HAVE to hold the team up. The Medic felt that way; while not a huge killing machine, he was both a game changer AND able to defend himself when needed. The Übercharge was the most powerful ability in the game, it defined the competitive meta.Soon as a support is deemed too meta defining, they're nerfed and nerfed.Yeah, some of the nerfs WERE needed (Ana's Grenade, Mercy's res issues) but then are left weaker and unfun until the next Witch Hunt begins.Where's the Witch Hunt for Tracer? She has almost always been the BEST pick for DPS unless of a cheesy strat (Bayblade or Pirate Ship) or another DPS was just buffed too much (Mei's ult charge, 76's 20 damage, McSniper, etc.). She is in almost every single competitive game, and in 79% of OWL. I get it, high skill high reward; except what about Ana? She has arguably a much higher skill floor than Tracer, yet has been the worst support since March 21st of last year.","

"Not having fun playing against this heroe because:A)	His normal attack has too much range and his ball does too much damage.B)	His mines in combination with his ball attack does too much burst damage.C)	His Ult Riptire has too much HP and his Ult in general can be performed with little harm to the player.  Just hide.For point A. I think that he should be good at primarily close quarter damage.  I don’t see the need for him to be able to spam his ball attacks from super far away.  Furthermore, I think the ball attack must make contact with the enemy before doing any type of damage, so no splash damage.  For point B. there is not much you can do if Junkrat got you with one hit, his mines will finish you off.  My suggestion would be to change the effects of his mines from doing damage to doing movement displacement like Pharas knockback rocket. For point C. Not every hero can take out the Riptire on their own, it requires incredible reaction and precision for what this ult can do.  Furthermore, it has very small weaknesses that a good player can remove with proper positioning and movement.  I would suggest reducing the HP of the Riptire and making it so that is slows down after each second time spend running.   Alternatively, the Riptire can be made to follow a straight path like Hanzo’s ult and be detonated at the users request.These are my opinions, I know I am not high ranked and I don’t know everything about this game. I just proving my feedback from my ranks perspective.  It is not fun for me and my friends to play against a player that know how to abuse this hero’s abilities. It takes too much effort to take him out from certain hero’s perspectives.   Thank you for reading and have a nice day.","

"Generally, fighting and losing against enemy isn't fun. Though from what you describe, its more on your tanks needing to switch to D.Va to create space for them to move about and deal with Junkrat or adopting their methods in response to Junkrat.Though on the opposite side, I'm also pretty darn sick of seeing Winston/Zarya and D.Va combo whenever I run Junkrat simply because of how well they can shut a Junkrat down. I can also tell you that I absolutely despise tracer, genji, winston and D.va simply because of how little you can do against that comp.Junkrat has weaknesses, its really up to you and your team to adopt against it. If you want to win(If that's how you have fun.), then either you or your friend has to step up.","

That is not Junkrat's fault however. It's just that he can get a lot more value when people just let him do his thing. Wich at our rank is the case way to often.It's a shame that blizzard doesn't reward people for counter picking, and doesn't punish getting destroyed by one of your counters in some way.

"Edit: Since Symmetra has now been addressed, I have updated the section about QoL adjustments with discussion within the megathread to make it easier for the developer team to read.This is extremely long, but I want to illustrate Symmetras problems and how to fix them, hopefully to enlighten the devs on how to fix her. There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Overwatch&utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]Discussion consolidated:These are the biggest things that needed to be addressed according to the megathread.Defensive assists for shield gen, as well as the ultimate voiceline ""flashing"" the ultimate location and radius to teammates for 5 seconds.More assists in general for Symmetra, perception of teamplay is just as big of an issue as how much is within her kit. Offensive assists could possibly be added to teleporter (while the visual effect is active on teammates) as well as turrets.Photon barrier is a handicapped supportive utility compared to other support utility that is meant to protect. Most things will spawn past it when you use it (roadhog hooks, flashbang) and you can't really aim it on teammates. Please look at improving it.Her ultimates incentivize her to play alone and practice nesting rather than play with her team, please give her more options for teamplay in the actual kit. Her killing potential is strong, so this should be a minor utility that can compete with healing without being as strong as healing as to not raise her winrate but make her ""feel"" better in a team game. People have suggested everything from an opposite of discord, to decaying shields, to reworking photon barrier so that it can supply decaying shields to teammates with a lower cooldown (either passing through, or activation like orisas ultimate)Teamplay is her biggest issue, by far. Her killing potential is decent for a dps offsupport. Number adjustments may make her too strong at lower tiers where she is considered better balanced.","

"(reserving this post to edit in other suggestions from the community, not the point of this thread, but here to voice any suggestions)FIRST OFF: I want to caution that reworking ideas are not the point behind this thread. More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools.","

"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact.","

"To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs.","
							 (Edited)

"Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect.","

"Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team.","

"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die.","

"Seriously, you guys need to lay off the Symm change ideas.. especially a lot of this complete reworks.  Symm is near perfect the way she is.. it is the community toxicity and the lack of use in the pro scene that holds her back.The pros don’t use her because she take a lot of practice and committment to the hero and lets face it.. the top pros would rather practice on skills that are easily transferable to other heroes, then practice a hero (like mercy who before she became a reworked OP mess— remember she was NU in pro play before her rework) who has a unique playstyle to use at a high level.  She could use some tweeks to help at higher level.. like making her ult silent.. or turret deployment improvements.. but anything else would make her way too dominate at the lower levels.","

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest.","

"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754867190#post-1I made a post about this in May and trying to bring it back now.Saying sym is a no skill hero is fukin stupid if people dont play her. People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad.","

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :(","

"I feel like for her Photon Barrier, it could get the Orisa treatment, just make it curvier to the sides so it can help block damage.Just curious OP, what do you think of this? Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility.","

Finally, she has a reload time.

So apparently players of my skill level are players with SR 200 or more above me, always on the enemy team. My team are actual similar skill level and often times lower. Yeah sure you could just say ""get gud"" I'd love to but it's really hard to ""get gud"" when these games are so one sided there's no way for me to possibly improve when my team is just rolled over every time. And in the rare case that I get all the high skill level players on my team, there's again no way for me to improve when my team just rolls over the enemy with little to no effort.I don't mind one tricks, I can deal with smurfs, but when I'm losing because the game itself has terrible matchmaking pitting one low to average skill team against a high skill team, it really demotivates me from playing.I used to say ""I don't think I'll ever want to stop playing this game."" I mean heck look at my level I'm level 1294 currently almost at my second gold star. I clearly put a lot of time into this game and loved it. But recently this matchmaking has been getting worse and worse, and I'm finding myself playing this game much less than half the time that I used to. I miss having good and even games, having close games that go into overtime, and awesome team fights. But now it seems that games just last 1-2 minutes because one team just rolls over the other. Or max time because one team can't even push past the first choke. Sorry for this ranty post, you can ignore it, downvote it or whatever, I just needed to vent about this. I'm probably still going to play the game but likely just stick around for just events, and very few times in between. Until matchmaking actually makes fair games, I just can't have fun with this game anymore.","

"Because I'm genuinely getting sick of being backfilled into games that are already on the results screen and not even getting that tiny amount of backfill XP for it.https://i.imgur.com/iKePUfK.jpgI soloq a lot, so the matchmaker seems to prioritize me for backfill. Don't get me wrong, I understand why the matchmaker needs to do this, but so many games, I'll join and instantly be faced with a DEFEAT screen before I've even had a chance to lock in my hero.I understand the very nature of the matchmaker will stop this issue from ever being 100% solved, but here's a few simple changes I propose to reduce the impact and make matchmaking far less stressful:1) Do not allow backfill during overtime, unless it's an ad hoc connection (a player actively choosing to join that specific game from the menu) or the player is already spectating and waiting for a slot. Let's be real, the odds of you being able to change anything in a 5v6 overtime are slim to none, about as high as the odds of you backfilling onto the winning team during that time.2) Give me more than a few hundred extra XP. I don't know what, maybe you could double my base XP during my next game, then maybe I won't get as frustrated when I do end up in these games.3) Put a cooldown between how frequently an individual can be backfilled. The amount of time I spend in queue jumping from endscreen to endscreen because the matchmaker repeatedly backfills me into impossible scenarios is directly impacting the amount of time I'm able to play. It would be nice if whenever I finish a backfill match, there was say, an hour during which time the game would lower or completely eliminate my odds of being backfilled.I'm not asking for a matchmaker overhaul, I'm asking to be able to play the game without getting salty before I've had a chance to play.","

"Mercy 1.0 was fun, but actually only a little less underpowered then she is now.  The reason why: Mercy had no abilities in her base kit that let her actively participate in the fight.  This railroaded Mercy players into basing their entire playstyle around the only active ability Mercy had: her ult, mass rez.Adressing hide n rez: this tactic came down to two sources - SR abusers and people who went waaay out of their way to hide in buildings, rooms below the point, and generally areas that took a while to get to (but was still in range of rez, since it didn't require LoS).  The SR abuse problem has been retroactiely solved with the removal of preformance based SR in diamond and above, and a LoS restriction would force Mercy to put herself out in the open to rez (giving enemies a chance to cc/kill her and eliminating the hide-and-seek minigame).  And one last thing: most Mercy players hated doing hide and rez - it was THEIR TEAMMATES who demanded it, and got toxic if the Mercy didn't.  The standard playstyle of Mercy is to stay with your team as long as possible, only ducking into cover if your team is taking more damage than you can heal/if you see an ult wipe incoming.I don't want to go back to a version of Mercy that doesn't have the GA bunnyhop, but I also hate rez on E with a passion and don't even consider Valkyrie to be an ultimate.  The best solution (to me) seems to be putting a balanced version of Mass Rez on Q, and figuring out an E ability that incentivises Mercy to stay with her team and use it to directly participate in the fight.","

Hide-and-go-Res wasn't LoS abuse.  Far, far from it.  It was where unskilled Mercy players would basically only play with their teams until they got ult, then they would hide away in some corner of the map far away from the teamfight.  They would probably instruct their team to all die on point, then wait for everyone to die before swooping in virtually uncontested for a huge res.  They did this to boost themselves into high ranks, because Performace SR rewarded players who performed more huge reses.I'm well aware of the predominant Mercy strategy to hide when enemy ults come.  The best Mercies I played with Tempo-resed all of the time.  But that doesn't change that poor Mercies were abusing SR gain from huge res by hiding regardless of the situation.And no, it wasn't retroactively solved by only removing performance-based SR in the highest ranks.  It will need to be removed across all ranks for Hide-and-Res to become less of an issue.  Want to know why?

"OH i enjoyed Mass Rez, except when the enemy teams' mercy popped out of nowhere on a Team kill and screamed her infamous lines in German, for resurrecting the whole team on the Payload and having them finish the fight. It did make mercy the wildcard in the game, because if you didn't kill mercy or find her in time, she re-started the fight. I look at this from both aspects: Positive and negative. I think the fight dynamics were most interesting before the single target rez and Valkyrie.Valkyrie though, has opened up a box of snakes. It encourages battle mercy. The community HATES this, but battle mercy IS fun this way. I just hit Valkyrie, yes the team is spamming I am ""Prick thrower"" for not healing. but I just mowed down the entire enemy team with a pistol. As for Widow VS Valkyrie mercy, its gg for widow. Even with well-placed headshots, mercy is still going strong. Valkyrie allows for Revenge kills with mercy, she can fly around anywhere and go after the player she has a grudge against.","

I only hope Blizzard would actually succeed and fix it.And this is coming from a big fan of new heroes. While new heroes do affect the rest of the game like change the meta, the broken/bad stuff we currently have is ruining the fun.A few things I can remember right now is when you disconnect 1 second before the match ends, even if you win you will receive a defeat and -50 SR. If the server dies and you get kicked, defeat and -50 SR. Disconnect, come back 10 seconds after and win the match? Defeat and -50 SR.  It takes months and months to make a simple change to a hero. Took 2 years to fix a Mei bug. Competitive is a mess, it's random, a lot of the times you can't play what you want unless you disregard what the team needs, and lots of people who play Competitive completely disregarding what the team needs.It's not fun when 95% of effort gets put into new content and 5% into existing content.","

"For one, even a decent Widowmaker requires a lot of mechanical skill, which is rather noteworthy. Someone who can track well with a sniper is most likely going to be a major asset to the team and cripple the enemy when played right.Also, Widowmaker has a lot of weaknesses in close quarters, hence her need to stay away from the brunt of the fight. I get that it sucks to be one-shot (a legitimate one-shot, not just multiple damage sources in short time-frame), but there are strengths and weaknesses to each character. Do remember that she is a Defense hero: she specializes in zoning areas. Having the possibility of being one-shot or losing a major amount of health is usually enough to encourage shields, strafing, or just outright avoiding the area.You gotta choose your battles.","

"The best course of action is to be mindful of the info you're given. Once the match starts you can check to see who's on the opposing team, and there will be audio queues from your character and/teammates letting you know there's a sniper. If you do get killed, watch the kill cam. It'll let you know where they're hiding, and you can plan accordingly.","

"Stream Sniping:  It's an intentional act to try to queue and get placed in the same game/match as the Streamer with the intention of ruining the Streamer's game/stream.  For example, Timthetatman was targeted by that stream sniper who would either get on his team, and throw.  Or be on the enemy team and would target Timthetatman over everyone else.

Not to mention another ape-based hero would be SOOOO underwhelming. I can hear the giant sigh of disappointment in the player base already. Every character that has been introduced is always different than the last. I expect the trend to continue.","

02/20/2018 11:04 AMPosted by Meowcenaryhttps://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Jetpack_CatLikely never gonna happen tho unfortunately. The idea was scrappedSuch a missed opportunity if they dont make it so. The reasons Jeff gave just dont sell it to me. He said the idea of a flying cat was too outlandish even for Overwatch but we have a talking scientist gorilla...he also said they ran into trouble designing the paws to work with the jetpack controls but I feel D Va's in-mech view is exactly this. So...why the difficulty? He said it was a scrapped idea but I would not be surprised if it was a hint of things to come. I just dont see it not being feasible and another animal hero would be a pretty bad !@# addition to the roster.,"

"Ok I was thinking a while back: What if jetpack cat was in the game. How would you make a cat with a jetpack a fighter? This is my take on it:Name: JetCat (because jetpack cat may be to long for the character select screen)Class: DefensePrimary Fire: 50 Damage ScratchSecondary Fire: Opens Up a Scope, Shots do 90 Damage a hit. Scope has a laser sight showing where the shots will go. Special frequency of light that only cat eyes can see.Ability 1:Tangle: Places A hairball on the ground in front of them. Anyone who walks through them will be slowed to 50% speed and mobility abilities are reduced by 50%. Can have 5 out at a time, must wait 5 seconds before placing another one. Does not stack with other hairball.Second Ability: Prowl: Jetpack Cat Becomes invisible all except for its eyes, similiar to a cat in the dark, for 5 seconds. Can shoot while invisible. 8 Second cooldown.Ultimate: Flight: JetCat's jetpack flies off and can either attach to an ally, who then gains control and can use it however, or can attach to an enemy and carry cool down.Thoughts?","

"Coming up with ideas of how it would work is the easy part. He/she could be a flying character similar to Pharah but without as much up-time (somewhere in between DVa's boosters and Pharah's hover). Maybe a hit-scan flyer but with slow mobility while airborne but when on the ground much faster however a different weapon, ability is used.","

"D.Va's accuracy is really not that important. For lots of heroes it isn't since there are a ton of factors that can inflate/deflate it. My D.Va accuracy probably hovers around 20%. She has lots of spread and a lot of her time shooting is spent just poking at enemies, so you cannot expect it to be too high. As for tips, try to find a nice medium between offensive and defensive with her. Only peel off for enemies who are all alone and you know you can get without your mech being destroyed. By and large you want to stay with your team. D.Va is not indestructable and her biggest weakness is how easy it is to melt her mech, so you must work around this weakness. D.Va's mobility and tankiness isn't to charge into the enemy team and try to assassinate an enemy while their entire team is around. You have to punish out of position enemies and go pick off the flankers. Having a high sensitivity isn't important and you need to find the sens you are most comfortable with. Sensitivity is all about preference so if you're having a hard time tracking enemies, I'd consider lowering it! Mine on console is just 65/65 and I find it works great for me tbh.","

I try to emulate the Dvas who get kills by launching it into the air but can never seem to get anyone with them unless they are stunned by other ults.For the bombs I would suggest working on sliding the bombs off of walls/objects. Those will be the sneakiest bombs since they get caught on the wall for a second until they slide out into the open and explode. Shooting the bomb off into the air at an angle also works well for me. I have little luck shooting it straight up into the air (it's just so predictable and differing sky boxes means where the bomb ends up detonating isn't consistent since it may hit the sky box or may not) and I would suggest you never ult to salvage your mech except for in the rare cases you /know/ your team can still win the fight and having you will help. Your best bet is to go into custom games and check out the best walls to slide your bomb off of (watch out because it can get stuck on some!)","

					",,,,,,,
One of D.Va's biggest asset is her mobility. Jump in and out of fights and punish when you see opportunities. When your team is pushing use her to create space. When you're under fire always try to show your back to minimize damage. Mastering this will make your DVa a lot more durable. Mix that with your DM too ofc.Always focus on the high priority targets or the ones that D.Va easily kills in a single rush missile combo.,"

"Tips for Dva, her DM should be saved for eating orbs and enemy ults.  You really shouldn't be using it to ""tank"".  Its more of gobble ults and occasionally protect allies out of position or allies pulled by hog.  You can also use DM when you are diving in on the enemy.  Dva is meant to be played aggressively, when you see an opportunity to dive on an enemy support do so.  Dive at them rocket in their face while shooting them and then melee.  They are typically dead with this combo.","

"This would cause more problems than it solves. People would click the category with the shortest wait time then play what they want anyways (invalidating the entire system). If you force them to play the role they select then DPS would have insane wait times. You'd also open the doors for throwers to pick support and just troll DPS players who waited ten minutes for a match (And giving a fast-lane for griefers). You'd also run into the issue of DPS players unable to hit Pharah due to no experience on Hitscan. But if you have supports who can, the system wont let them swap mid game. That is of course you allow a system to bypass the initial system... which then defeats the purpose of the role select system from the get go.","

I solo que.Not to mention I CAN play other heroes and so could most people on my team. Being a one trick is playing one sole HERO not one sole role. It's just that we all had all of OUR hours on support except for me and the tank guy. Also I'm a tank AND support main. -_-I just call myself a support main because people call me that even though I play more hours on tank than I want to.And last I checked you don't have to be great at every hero in the game. There are a ton of players that climbed with only 3 to 4 heroes (I can play 7 hereos comfortably). Plus I dont like being dps, I like having large health pools and being able to heal myself before anyone else.  I could go into detail on why I don't like playing most dps heroes in Overwatch but it's really just down to none of them have a playstyle that I've liked so far. Oh I can play dps. I'm just not consistent. Sometimes I do really well and other times I'm just there to feed the enemy. Not to mention in every game people instalock dps. And I only play comp. If I were to play dps in comp people would report me for throwing because they see my hours aren't on dps. I can't play quick play because it's boring to me. I guess I could Smurf and instalock dps on a second account, otherwise it really wouldn't be wise for me to practice in comp. Plus don't forget the fact that I would be hella bored playing characters I don't want to play. I didn't have this problem playing Paladins. At least in that game there were about 3 champions in every role that I liked and was really good at. Tyra, Viktor, Lian...Ruckus, Fernando, Torvald...Seris, Ying, Jenos...Can't wait for a ""then go back to Paladins"" comment.I don't know why I'm so different in Overwatch. I guess no matter how similar the characters seemed on paper, in actuality they play very differently.","

At least when a genji or tracer steals my kills they have to be somewhat aware of the situation unfolding and have the cognitive ability to either aim their cursor or press swift strike and most importantly of all the person they are killing is actually on their screen. Moira on the other hand doesn't even need to be at their keyboard and that isn't an exaggeration. You can fire the orb in a random direction,get up and go get a drink and come back to multiple kills.","

"One, five-stacks become impossible.Two, this leads to extremely long queue times and higher chances of imbalanced matches for anyone not solo queueing. In fact, as of now, there's quite a few people who regularly play in groups that think there's a bias against them, which is that the matchmaker will assume groups are stronger, and find more skilled solo-queue opponents to make up for the assumed difference if it can't find a more equally sized and skilled group.And this is longer queue times for everyone, mind you, regardless if it's solo queue or not.Unless a whole new competitive system is introduced (hi, guild system?), this just can't feasibly happen for every single match. Solo queuers are the easiest to get into games and fill into matches, removing them and putting them into their own queue just can't work without ruining the experience of the other half. Right now, you just have to enter the games knowing you're always at the risk of being placed into or against stacked teams -- but the matchmaker considers that already, so, you know, this just feels like one more excuse to say ""the game made me lose, change the game for me."" No offense.","

"Agree / Signed.1. Solo (1/1/1/1/1/1)2. Mix It Up (2/2/2 or 4/2 or 3/3)3. Full (6)No 5/1 unless you check ""will fill"" which would allow any of the current combos. If you are in a duo and check ""allow fill"" you can be teamed with solos. Otherwise, you're with other small groups.The ""versus"" would have a different metric, similar to what it is now. Solos won't go against 6-stacks, but might go up against Mixed Stacks. You don't get to choose your opponents.This, along with an ""avoid joining team with this player"" will affect your queue time. That's OK if that's what you want.For 6 stacks, allow an alternate player in the case of disconnects. This player must be in the group (which means that groups can actually be larger than 6) and the team sorts out who is in the game during the load time. If you don't choose in time, it's random. The 7th player spectates. He can't be ""tagged in"" though... if someone leaves, they can't come back, and they get the leaving penalty. This could only be done for groups though. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't sign up for a fill unless I really trusted my team. And if you allow a troll on your team who comes in and throws, that's on you, and only affects people who willingly grouped up together.","

"What has been one or some of your funniest moments in Overwatch so far, whether it be in Training, Skirmish, Competitive, Quick Play, or Custom? One funny moment I had, I think I was 76. We were attacking in Hollywood, and the defending team was spawn-killing us and the match was 3/4 over and we were losing. Somehow I managed to dash past everybody by going through the building on the left outside the attack spawn point (ran down the stairs, through the archway past their Reinhardt, and went behind the building next to the point), and was literally just crouching behind the car on the point the whole time, captured about 90% before they figured out someone was on point and they all came after me and killed me. That was amusing. We did win in the end, because of that. ;)Another funny moment was during the Army of One brawl, in Skirmish.

Instead I landed in this little crevice in the rocks. I couldn’t get back up without someone to fly to with Guardian Angel. I couldn’t climb or jump over the rocks to fall, die and respawn. So I’m in this stupid friggin’ grotto on Illios, and all I hear from my team is “I NEED HEALING!”So (having no mic) I start spamming the text chat.  “Help! I’m stuck down a hole! I can’t get out!”  And I take Mercy’s pistol and start shooting into the sky, in bursts of three, the universal signal for “I’m in the sh*t” in gun language, hoping to lead one of my teammates to me.So I hear footsteps above me, and soon friendly Widowmaker falls past me and dies, bless her heart for trying. Another minute goes by and I hear Sombra’s “Hello!”  And I finally look up, and there’s my friendly Sombra looking over the edge down at me, waving hello.So I was finally able to use her to GA out of the hole, and she and I both died about 2 seconds later by enemy Roadhog.

I think they were just as shocked as me that no death blossom was forethcoming as we all know what it means when you see a Reaper jump down behind your team. I couldn't figure out what happened until I saw my Ultimate guage with the number 98%.Time slowed down and we must have stared for at least a few seconds. Then we remembered that we were playing Overwatch and on different teams.

It will be like Reddit and how they can control things. So basically if you get down voted a ton of times your going to have a higher restriction on how many times you post and what your post are allowdd to have.Posted a few times on a subreddit for hunters x hunter and the reddittors downvoted it to hell(I forget what post I was probably oblivious to information) I have a 10 minute restriction for post.

"I truly and honestly believe Blizzard is getting their act together. They revamped the report system., They made the rules clear, they've made a point out of 2 popular streams for false reporting one tricks, and Jeff himself has said on the forums that throwing is reportable and one tricking is not, and that reporting one tricks is bannable.While there's definitely room for this implementation of silenced users not being able to post on the forums to be dangerous, account silences are never permanent the first time. So if it happens once you will most definitely get to speak up when the chat ban runs out. if it happens again, well.... Idk man I can only say it's most likely your own fault.And there's always blizzard customer support (like actually contacting them instead of just responding with a ticket)","

I'm glad Blizzard has the pro games. It makes it easier to spot the cheaters. I'm just supposed to believe that 1 out ever 100 players just happens to be better than any pro I've ever seen. And they all happen to play quick play instead of competitive? (only saw one super absurd aim player in comp). Blizzard needs to do a better job of finding and banning these players. It's not enjoyable to both play against and with these people.,"

"(WARNING: LONG RANT) So I’m having a nice game in Junkertown on Quickplay right? Minding my own business as Tracer, and our team is really dominating. Like we managed to push it from the beginning to the second point without being stopped. So in my head I’m thinking, “Yes! I might actually get a bunch of free XP!” since it’s really hard to get when solo queuing like I’m left to do 99% of the time I play Overwatch. Then suddenly I see a Reinstancing sign at the top of the screen because 3 enemy teammates left. And just like that I’m kicked from the match I was in. WHY? Just because my team was winning and some salty players left? I get it, they left and gave the enemy team a disadvantage. But that’s why you’re already forcing people to be backfills for games like these. So why, why do I and the rest of my teammates have to get cheated out for our hard work? It’s just so frustrating to have to lose XP like that, especially when it means I’m closer to another Lunar Event Loot Box. Sorry for the long rant.","

"Honestly there's probably some fun psychology behind what types of personalities gravitate towards particular hero types.But in general, I'd imagine tanks really want team play, so they're people who often want to succeed and enjoy multiplayer games the most.By contrast, and I'm not !@#$ting on DPS, a lot of FPS games do not require any teamwork and you can just lone-ranger your way through it. Some people just want all the kills, all the damage, and don't want to protect healers, tanks, divers.

Absolutely. I play Zenyatta a lot. I rely mostly on tanks for survivability in the game. Especially barrier tanks since I usually got no means of escaping. I've had Zarya's saving me from getting pinned by Reinhardt also hog not getting that shot after hooks.  Sometimes I've had hogs hooking enemy Mccrees after using their flashbang on me or even completely shielding me while taking a breather (thanks to this 50% damage reduction buff). These kinds of players truly understand the awareness of the games. Also being a big hitbox hero also makes you vulnerable.,"

Not to mention a lot of ""healer mains"" are not healers by choice, but because nobody wants to take the role.DPS mains... well, are Dps mains, If they are under-performing or just being countered, they start pointing fingers at each other for not healing or not doing whatever rather than picking another hero or try a different approach. Tanks on the other hand, are somewhat dependent on their team, but can still carry regardless of what the rest of their team are doing. they have the mentality of a support, they know they require their team to be of any use, but are still capable of getting kills themselves, and so, they don't get as frustrated as other players.

"It's because tanks get the least amount of crap from their teammates. Most of the player base has no idea what they do and they aren't willing to do it better so you get less flame for playing tank. Playing on a tank only account VS my main where I play DPS, I get a crazy amount of flame playing DPS. Even if I'm playing poorly on tank, no one will say anything or blame DPS/support.If you consistently treat someone badly, they will act badly. This is why Hanzo mains have the stereotype of being sour, they get flamed on the daily.","

because alot of people who lack aiming skill are playing supports like mercy and moira and if ana becomes balanced (not op or anything just balanced) they would be wrekt therefore blizzard keeps ana underpowered and mercy and moira overpowered.,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"Ana's value is about staying aliveAs the only support without a clear way to stay alive (Healing passive, high damage, or high mobility) she struggles in that sense.Ana's BEST tool is her Grenade; it is also her ONLY tool to heal herself. If you take a stray rocket or explosion for 120 damage, you use your grenade to heal. Yet it leaves you STILL under full health meaning you need to leave the fight for a health pack OR take focus from your other support.Ana is a character that thrives in slower, closer games BUT with how the game has been mobility creeped (Doomfist, Sombra, Moira, Mercy, Widowmaker, Junkrat, new Hanzo*tm*) and how much faster the game is played, Ana doesn't really have a leg to stand on anymore.She has ONE tool that has a 0.5 second delay before it is shot off to defend herself. It has a 12 second cooldown. Every single movement ability has a lower cooldown than that.Ana's ONLY self healing has a 10 second cooldown. Every support has one that is faster and more consistent that CAN'T be blocked. Even Moira, if she can't life steal has her biotic orb that has the same cooldown BUT heals for MORE (Not to mention fade)Ana needs at LEAST a form of healing passive at this point. Buffing her Sleep Dart or BioGrenade are VERY dangerous; they have the potential to be VERY overbearing if they're not kept in check with their restrictions.","
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"It's dumb. You have heroes like Widow, Soldier, McCree who become really powerful if you have the aim. A skilled Ana should absolutely be outperforming other supports.  Moira is at the power level a practised Ana should be at. Moira should be a robust anti-flanker healer who sacrifices output. The balance decisions in this game drive me wild.","

"She has the tools to be the most powerful healer (sleep dart is obviously good if you have the aim for it, and her nade is criminally underrated) what she currently lacks are the passives to take her that step further. She needs a better way to get health back other than wasting her nade on herself, and it's ridiculous that a sniper-healer is best rewarded for basically sticking her rifle up her tanks behinds - she needs to be able to get to better vantage spots faster than walking around up stairs forever. Other than that the current meta just doesn't favor her. Winston is brutal on her with both his attack and his shield, and Tracer annihilates Ana within seconds unless she gets a lucky sleep on her. If we get a tank-heavier meta that relies more on death-ball you will see her more.","

You're trying to tell me she doesn't ?Not at close range. Not at shieldbreak or mobility or self-sustain. She can kill people faster and from farther away, which is huge, but she crumples pretty fast in a brawl and can be pretty hard countered.[Ed: My point, in case it isn't clear, is that even if Ana is buffed (and I think she probably should be), she will always have some drawbacks compared to the ""easier"" supports as a tradeoff for her hugely valuable utility]","

"Low survivability causes heroes to hide before ulting. Why does Reaper hide before ulting? Well, ironically, he can't use shadow step in a fight and not expect to die. Same for Mercy, if Guardian Angel was reliable enough, which it isn't, she hid as an unhealthy exploit, and used res as her ""hehe sorry but I'm back"" button.Same reason McCree is encouraged to hide before using his slow-movement ult? Same reason Pharah has to sneak in Barrage.I GENUINELY don't understand whats confusing.","

"What you fail to understand, is that NOT having a support present, to heal people was the reason for people dying. Back when mercy had mas res, you had 2 options.Either you picked ana or a mercy.If you had ana, she could have kept your team alive, be a part of it and contribute.For mercy, She would hide somewhere. Not heal anyone during that time. Cause everyone to die only for the possibility of mas res which most of the time, was immediately shut down by higher level players. Which is why mercy never saw even the slightest bit of usefulness for grandmaster lvl and above. At least now she's more engaging. She contributes during fights and she doesn't hide somewhere and is actually more viable than before.","

"Yeah, I LOVE the generalization that many, not all, of the DPS mains put out about Mercy. The BAD Mercy players played ""Hide and Rez"", the GOOD ones didn't. Not ALL of the videos on YouTube show Mercy doing Hide and Rez do they?No, they do not. Yet that is what we are ALWAYS accused of. But the Original Post DOES have a point! 1) Reaper, McCree, and often Soldier 76 and Junkrat would hide then pull their Ult to maximize damage to the enemy team.2) Hanzo just shoots through walls with HIS Ult, basically hiding but not quite.3) Tracer can ZIP in, drop her mine, then ZIP back out quickly.4) D.Va can turbo her Meka in for her Ult.I could go on, but you get the general idea. Yet Mercy, due to a few bad players, had her Ult removed and replaced, then nerfed into the ground.Just saying that if any DPS hero had been treated THIS harshly, do to a few rotten apples in the bunch, the game would have already folded up tent and no one would be playing anymore. Yet do this to a Healer, and YEAH we can still kill stuff and play...Ready for the down-votes...","

That is just the way Death Blossom and Shadow Step are designed. Even if Reaper had good mobility (which he doesn't have), you would still hide if you want to pull off a successful Death Blossom.","

I would imagine having 0 hours played as her you wouldn't know how she was used. I had a quintuple rez as Mercy once, defending point A of Temple of Anubis. I heard about two or three Ultimate callouts from the enemy team, so I knew there were going to be a few deaths whether I was trying to heal them or not. So I did the smart thing and hid on the other side of the arch. Sure enough, a couple more enemy Ultimates were sent in and they wiped all five of my teammates, and again, it would not have made a difference if I had been trying to heal them, I just would have died as well.So I waited for all that mess to clear up, swooped in and got the easy 5-rez. We hard held point A because they had burned every single Ultimate they had. It was extra sweet because the team had asked me to swap off Mercy at the start of the round. Boy did they feel stupid.","

Especially given the utter lack of counterplay of 1.0.Lets see, counter-plays to Mercy 1.0 HUmmmmmm? This was BEFORE she was given temporary invulnerability because more than half the time she would die pulling Rez in the first place.1) as always KILL the Mercy by:...A) in the ult ...B) before you pull ult...C) while she is flying in (Widowmaker/Hanzo mains)2) AFTER she pulls her Ult by:... Saving 1 ult to take care of a recently Rezed team. BUT, this took coordination an with one person pulling their Ult, and the other DPS not wanting to be outdone, the other DPS/Tanks would pull their Ults doing all that Showboating.... ummm.. I mean ""Hard work"" to get the POG.You blow 3-5 Ults at the same time, not saving any Ults JUST IN CASE of a Rez, then it is YOUR OWN DANG FAULT and your team should be punished for it.I had this one game, running back from spawn for about the 5th time because my DPS couldn't be bothered to take out the flankers that were targeting me. I come back to where they all are, after 3 people on the enemy team had pulled there Ults at the same time to take out my team. I fly in to the middle of them and pull an absolutely PERFECT 5 man Rez, it was BEAUTIFUL!!! Anyway, everyone knows how small a Tracer bomb is right? This one VERY smart Tracer threw her bomb into the middle of us and my 5 man Rez turned into a 6 man wipe. QUITE DESERVINGLY, the Tracer got PoG. So don't you DARE say there were ""No Counters to Mercy Rez"" because there sure were before, during, AND AFTER.","

I did not say Hiding from your Ult, because getting clear or being clear of it is not hiding. Now you, and other HEAVY killing Ults have one less defense against them. An, quite honestly, many of Mercy 1.0 Rezes were Tempo Rezes of 1 to 3 Heroes, not Huge Rezes of 4-5 Heroes.

"I don't think he's bad but he's such a niche dps compared to the others. Even as a tank buster Bastion is usually just a better pick cause he shreds them faster, can do it from a distance and can break shields. His abilities are also kinda lack luster. Teleport is way to slow, leaves him vulnerable for 2 seconds (also kinda buggy sometimes) and is very map dependent to get value out of, wraith form is okay but kinda one note and easy to play around.Again I don't think he's bad but he could stand to see a little love, maybe make wraith form a bit faster, let him teleport whilst in wraith form, re-work teleport into something a bit more practical.","

Only that people attempted to use it to do that.I avoided a player the day the Overwatch servers went live. In the two months before it was removed I played games against the player I avoided maybe a dozen or so times. I would chat in ALL chat with them before the match started. The person I was playing against did not know I placed them on Avoid Player, and I did so because of game philosophy disagreement, I play to win this person did not. I know each and every time I was against them it was the same person I avoided, and I confirmed that they were still on my list to make sure I had not removed them.The avoid player feature was removed because Blizzard figured out before it was too late, that some players were becoming so bothersome other people did not want to play with them. Eventually these individuals would not find a game in a timely manner. Blizzard admitted that the system was working as intended. I am guessing they just didn't know how well it would intend on working, or how fast it would remove the unwanted from the player pools.","

And tbh, with this restriction why should anyone avoid some awesome player from being on your team at all?2.1) Set the avoid player function on a list of ~30-50 player.This way you can't just avoid anyone for eternity because if there is someone else you want to avoid and your list is full, well then you just remove someone from your list you haven't seen for ages.OR2.2) Set the avoid player list unlimited but remove players automatically after a while (72hrs/1week/1month/1season ) this way you will be able to avoid certain players for a while but they will be ""unavoided"" after the time frame you put them on your list is gone.","

In 13 years playing Blizzard games, and the same amount of time following topics on the forums as well as Blizzard design philosophy. Blizzard has never made a change in any game ever based on the experience of one player. Blizzard has always made decisions based upon how inclusive a change can be. ""Avoid Player"" was an exclusionary option. It allowed you to not have to play with people you did not want to play with. This pretty much goes against everything I have ever seen Blizzard do.I will still defend my opinion. ""Avoid Player"", even with a minor glitch of increasing the queue time of some people unintentionally, was working exactly like it should have. The only people who do not want an Avoid feature are people who would be avoided, and probably are in every facet not just Overwatch.","

I have used controllers before so not super alien to me but for some reason no matter what settings I do on Overwatch the controller just feels bad. I feel like the controller has ""mouse acceleration"" It sometimes moves slow then sometimes moves too fast, and motion blur that can't be disabled makes it even harder. Does anyone know the best optimal settings for Overwatch on PS4 or is it just something I gotta get use too? (Also if there is a way to disable motion blur?

Maybe the motion blur is caused by your tv/monitor? I don't know much about that, so maybe try tweaking the tv's picture settings.","

"Which one do you use most often? Left click:Pros:Better dps at 0.4 sec between shots (2.5 shots per second)You can spam chokes and the battle field to contribute to team damageCons:You stay in line of sightLow burst damage (so you might not get kills)Right click:Pros:You can tuck behind a corner and stay safeBurst damage potential to one shot people and don't allow them to get awayCons:Worse dps at 0.6 sec for each charge (1.666 shots per second)Lower spam potentialBut here's the question: I have been using primarily the left click because of higher DPS. Basically, unless I am being chased or I have a particular target that I want to burst down, I use left click. Typically, I stand a safe distance away discord, harmony and just spam the battle field with left-click, at the head level (okay, I try to predictive but it is hard and I don't think I have the exact mechanical or timing skills for mastery).But I am wondering if this is the best way to do it. So my question is, assume, you are playing Zen at a safe distance and nobody is jumping on you and there is a fight going on in front of you. Do you use left clicks or right clicks?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"left click in the fight. right click for shooting at span, a genji jumping over you, a tracer, anything where you think you can burst someone. some pros have compared right click to scatter(i dont think) but right click is def more powerful than left click, its just left is more consistnt so you have to use it more","

"IMO it depends on how important transcendence is.  If the enemy is running grav-dragon or some other wipe combo, I usually prefer left-clicking their tanks in the fight to build ult faster.  If trance isn't that important, I'm more likely to go for r-click snipes.","

"Interesting opinions. The trans angle is definitely a good point. Left click has higher DPS potential and it is easier to charge up using tanks but even if I have trans, I prominently used to use left clicks. But is the sniping potential of right click that makes it better or the safety offered by being able to charge behind cover? Assume there are no snipers, otherwise, I agree charge shots are definitely better.","

"Left-click for fighting mobile targets.  Also, it's faster to stop shooting to assign Healing and Discord Orbs.Right-click for corner-peek shots, spamming corridors, smashing high HP targets.  Fully charged Right-click corner-peek shots are also good for destroying Torbjorn turrets which can generally shoot Zenyatta down faster than he can destroy it.  But avoid charging shots all the time as Zenyatta is locked in his animation and can't assign his orbs while doing so.","

If you can't kill Moira and she kills you over the course of four seconds, yes, you got outplayed.For reference, Tracer at maximum range can potentially unload 240 damage into a Moira, making the self-heal worthless. While I admit you need near perfect aim to do this, it's not unrealistic given Tracer can negate most of Moira's damage by using 'E', thus potentially prolonging the fight to 10 seconds, giving a much larger margin of error for Tracer's aim.","

More damage, though? That's not true at all. Zenyatta and Symmetra outdamage her by about a mile and a half, and even Mercy can do better damage than her if you can land headshots. And she's no tank, either. She's just as susceptible to burst damage as the other supports are.

She’s best against weak but sustained damage(Sombra, Soldier) but helpless against burst. Can’t outheal a Tracer’s clip to the head, since her pistols fire so fast. Also, all tanks have armor(not Roadhog, but he gets about half his health back when he uses TaB, so there’s that) and Moira doesn’t. I also forgot when exactly they gave her a large tank-sized health pool. She has the best consistent damage, but not the best overall. Zen and Sym melt poorly coordinated teams like butter in an oven, and Mercy’s pistol does more if you can consistently land headshots.","

The lowest dps in the game. If she has her damage orb on a target long enough, she can do 100 dps. Which only puts her above Ana in the support dps department. She then matches Mercy. However, the balancing point then comes between Moira’s soft-lock beam which can’t crit but is consistent and Mercy’s ability to crit which takes more aim. Lucio and Zenyatta our dps Moira. I will say if Moira is flanking to play dps and take out low health heroes - the other team must be makjng some really poor choices.","

"Below are some ideas that the community or myself have requested to the devs, but have never been added to the game. The following changes are sensible and well thought out, be sure to comment your opinions and suggestions as I will be updating this a lot.ChangesSombra Translocator Cancel; Ever been waiting around ages or have to use the teleporter when you could just simply hold E (or another key) to cancel it?In-game Alerts; Picture this, every time you get yourself caught in junkrat's trap, the enemy team gets notified that someone has been trapped- rather than only the junkrat being notified. This makes it so you don't have to shout it out on voice chat, and allows players who don't use voice chat or text to communicate what is happening. This doesn't just stop here; as you can be notified say if- Torb's turret was destroyed. I know that most characters have voice lines which say that something has happend; but for the competitive side it's much more convinent for the average player. This change will allow players to be more cooperative and work as a team to perform combos.Symmetra Shield Health GUI; In a recent patch Winston was given the ability to view his shield's health with a small GUI. This is a nice touch and suits the game as other characters like Reinhardt can view their shield's health. So why is Symmetra left out on this?! OK, sure- maybe it's not as important as Winston's, but it really isn't anything too hard to do and can help in some situations.Heal/Damage Numbers; This could be a toggle on/off option which allows you to show how much healing/damage you are doing. This may be useful for people who want to test stats or change settings in a Custom Game.Extended Sombra Invisiblity; If you read the title, you probably already understand my message im giving you- why does she only get a limited amount of time? You go to chase someone and.. it runs out? Or you become visible when you didn't want to? She's a stealth Hero! Not a visible Hero!More Custom Game Options; And you wonder why no one chooses the Custom Browser which you put on the main page of the gamemodes, if there isn't any settings to change within the game- then its just boring. Sure you added some settings like no gravity, but us creative players we want more options or we can't create that perfect huge roadhog boss battle that we all wanted to make!Clans; Wouldn't it be cool if we could all create a clan, lets say if you have a lot of expirence with the game you can! So like once you reach level 50 or so, or maybe a star (level 101) you can create a clan with a custom profile picture and start adding your friends to it. Sort of like a very minature village.Torbjorn's Hitbox; Nuff said.Detailed Scoreboard; Right now people just say ""4 gold m9 lol im doing GREAT im so pro"", but imagine if you could give players detailed information on how awful they are playing. (im just joking this will lead to more toxic behaviour but it would be cool to view more detailed stats).Changeable Weapons and Skins; Look ok, we all know we want Widow's Cote D'azur skin but at the same time having her Nova Skin's Gun.Updated Hero Information Screen; This hasn't change since the game launched for the old heroes, so this means that new players who follow the video instructions learning how to play Symmetra will try and give people shields by using the E key (second ability).New Training Zone; We all know it hasn't changed since.. well.. the game launched- at all. Look i'm sure Symmetra can use hard light to craft a new Training Zone.Higher Skill Cap To Play Competitive; Tired of getting matched with a guy that only knows how to place a turret as Torbjorn?","

I don't think Sombra needs extended invisibility but tanslocator cancel would be great. Sometime I throw trans to a bad spot it takes forever to get it back,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"The Translocator cancel isn't relevant unless you always put it on a health pack and expect to teleport back to it. Just save your Translocator for when you need it and then throw it, so you can stay in the vicinity of the fight, and don't have to run back and forth while abandoning your team.This is basically the same thing as the Translocator example. You're just using it without considering what you want to use it for.  Set yourself a goal, such as you have to use Stealth to flank around and kill the healer, or you have to use it to chase down Genji trying to go for a health pack. Using Stealth this way means that time won't be a problem at all, because you won't be running aimlessly all over the map.It seems to me like Blizzard is adding new options to custom games with every other update. I really don't see why this is a complaint other then players being impatient.Yes, a guild system is the most requested change in the game. I don't see how anyone can disagree with this.There needs to be a disadvantage to always running around in crouch. A taller target is always going to be easier to hit then a smaller one. Torbjorn can practically hide behind is turret.I don't see this ever happening. The weapon skins are a part of the skins as a whole. The ability to change color scheme on your weapon skin would be more realistic.I don't think a training zone is a big priority for Blizzard, even though it would be nice to have for the hardcore wannabe pros, so they can spend hours shooting dots.Blizzard are improving on the grouping system all the time, they have said this often. It will never be perfect.","

She feels like a Generalist in a Specialists body. She has a lot of different abilities and they don't feel like they line up together with each other. She's a support but really only supports by using her shield SOMETIMES and using her ultimate. (Which in my book isn't enough. You could make Widowmaker a Support for the same reasons. Venom Mine reveals a target that's affected and her ultimate reveals all targets.)She's called a defensive hero because she has the DPS for it AND she has defensive capabilities.I know you said the roles were ""guidelines"" but I truly wanna know what direction you aim to take Symmetra in.","

She is a jack if all trades, and that's not a bad thing.Sym can fill in the gaps in poor team comps e.g. Low of tanks? Sym can block damage and create space. Low on healing?

"I agree with ShinyPants, she actually has a lot of utility, it's a shame that people don't realize that. I play symmetra quite a bit, and I'd say she is actually a viable pick in many cases, both on attack and defense. She is a high risk though, when played good she can delete whole teams and carry the game, but also when properly countered she can be completely useless.The biggest problem with symmetra is that people don't know what to do with her and how to use her. She has a very odd design, unlike any FPS character, and in the meantime has developed a reputation of being somewhat of a troll pick. I get regularly harassed for playing her in comp before we even leave the spawn room. It's a shame, I really find her fun to play, precisely because she's not you typical CoD character. It was this fact, that OW is not like every other shooter out there, that has drawn me to it in the first place.","

"The game is balanced and designed for PC more than console, as well as receiving updates at the same time or faster as console, in addition to having the PTR.Also, from what I know at the high ranks on console most players use a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller with a special adapter, which gives them an unfair advantage on console while being standard on PC.So I'd recommend moving to PC if you can make the transition (like DSP Stanky did) but if console is your thing where all your friends are you should probably stay there.","

"Usually, the tactic is simple. When looking for a first pick to snowball from, the healer is your best target. The first team to kill the opposing healer has the greatest advantage for the team fight. Moira, however, is a new beast in that regard. She is not just a simple pick. She is ruthless by design. She opposes the aging tactical staple of “kill the healer first.” Instead, she is a close range healer that encourages high health pools and tight knit groups. With multiple teammates to guard her and a high sustainability she is not going to be that simple pick. That “Overwatch Old” strategy falls apart. This means tactics from this character must change and adaptation is finding new life in my favorite game. Since Moira encourages tight knit formations, the strategy changes from “kill the healer” to “divide and conquer.”  Moira, being a close range healer, needs to be separated from the majority of her team to disable her healing. If she is too far away, she cannot speed boost, Guardian angel or snipe to heal her mates. Instead, she will be forced to use her fade. If she does this, she becomes much more predictable and easier to focus down. If she does not, she will only have her healing orb to provide aid to distant allies, which is far better for the opposing team than a healing orb combined with primary fire. To me, Moira also enables Mei for the team that opposes her. Mei is equipped specifically for separating the opposing team and sometimes isolating singular characters at a time. Roadhog is also adept at separating characters from their teams. Roadhog is better at bringing Moira down than most, but hooking anyone removes them from healing range and, of course, into range of a face full of rusty bits.Junkrat. He punishes clustered enemies. Pharah. Punishes clustered enemies and can force them apart with Concussive Blast.I hope more characters of varying specialties are given to us in the future. I always love to see a game evolve past it’s own cliches.","

"Mercy and Lucio also have similar survivability to Moira, as you pointed out Moira's is worse as once she uses fade she becomes a sitting duck.Moira's real strength and the one that comes up most often in complaints is her ability to duel. No one cares that Mercy flies around the battlefield because she doesn't really hit back. No one cares that a good Lucio who can wallride and hit his shots is both hard to hit and hard hitting. Moira does basically what a good Lucio does and outheals your damage and hits you back hard. She has low dps but the almost guaranteed nature of it means it's a 4 or 2 second time for her kill squishy characters.

The survivability itself isn’t new, but she is admittedly easy to learn. On the flip side, the two most popular flankers to take down the main healer are Tracer and Genji. Lucio is not the main healer and his value from speedboost is arguably better than his healing song and also easy to grab value from as is his viability near ledges on certain maps. That said, I know Lucio needs a little buff love. Moira is easy to play with low average damage because there isn’t much else that can counter the popular flankers and still be so close to balanced as a healer. She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.","

She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.I don't think her kit should be changed. I think Ana, Mercy and Lucio need some buffs(in that order for priority). If they're not Blizzard needs to decide what they consider a balanced support is. If it's Moira then other people needs buffs, if it's Zen that Moira may need some slight number tweaks and she's head and shoulders in a higher tier than all the other supports.I can agree with that.","

Massive heals and damage.That comparison is very shallow. Allowing a similar team composition does not mean they both are countered in the same way(or not at all). Moira can be separated and her healing is diminished. Ana can snipe heal. Ana wasn’t an anti flanker. Ana had no resource meter. Ana had a better ultimate.,"

"There is another side of it too.For most of match making, this is the first time there's been a viable healer that actually has the raw healing to sustain a teammate through nearly anything a single hero can throw at them.  I mean seriously... if you stack Moira's left click and heal ball, you are looking at 155 HPS.  That's a bit insane.  Most heroes can't chop through that alone without ridiculously good aim.Suddenly... you can't handle Moira with the two ways you'd normally handle healers... Those being either kill them as you mentioned or simply land way more damage than they can heal.  Instead you need to either shoot something that Moira isn't healing, force Moira to bail, force Moira and her healing target apart, or insta gib one of them.  This is causing problems for a lot of people because I've noticed that especially around my level... they are pretty bad at target priority and if you go lower I imagine it gets worse.","

"Here's just one idea...FPS exploded in popularity (at least on consoles) after games like Goldeneye/Perfect dark... which were then followed by the huge hits like Halo1, Halo2, and then of course Halo3, which is about the time the Call of Duty games showed up and started eating halo's market share.Since then, FPS games (again, at least as far as consoles are concerned) kinda peaked... and haven't much evolved.  We've all heard of the CoD/halo clones and how generic they are.In all of those^ games, it was all about GLORY.  How many kills can you secure?  I still remember when Halo2 dropped and it was the first time I'd heard of a ""K/D"" spread... after that... it's like all my friends and I cared about were how many kills we got.  And even then, those kills didn't matter if we were dying a lot.  So anyway, shooters peaked, and companies are looking for ways to switch up the formula.  One of those ways is to introduce game play that forces cooperation and focus on objectives, rather that just going and out securing kills each. and. every. game. like the last 50 FPS titles we've played over the earlier years.I know I mentioned consoles even though OW is a PC game... but my point is... I wouldnt have touched OW if I hadn't first played those other FPS's on consoles.  Those earlier games gave me the confidence to just try in the first place, because I knew aiming with a mouse/keyboard would take some getting used to.At any rate... gamers need to adapt to OW, and those that refuse, well... they're gonna have a bad a time.","

He just kept returning to curse at me even more. I went to spectator and just repeatedly kicked him until he gave up joining, but not after a few players left, and Match chat received some of his choice P*/D*/F* words.Can we please have more control over blocking abusive players?

"As stated, Blizzard has stated that we already know or have ""met"" Hero 27. That stated, a barrage of who that may be has gone rampant with everyone grabbing at even the slightest mention of a throwaway character. This is my personal opinion of the best possible choices for a new Hero and the worst:=-=BESTBrigette Lindholm (Dragon Slayer Comic, Reflections Comic, Honor and Glory Short, Character Interactions)=One of the few characters with the most mentions and connections to other current Heroes, she is definitely a show in, especially after Blizzard created a character model for her in the Honor and Glory Short. As far as her role, I see her as a Defense character like her dad, maybe being able to fix or reinforce characters' machines/ shields, etc. Liao (First Strike Novel [CANCELED], Hero Document Hints [Ana])=As much as they redacted the First Strike comic, they still mention Liao on the Atlas News Articles as well as the documents hinting at Ana being the first new character. Be an interesting new dynamic if Liao was a duo with his/her robot companion, like the Ice Climbers or other similar duos from video games. Athena (Reflections Comic, Recall Short, In-Game Announcer)=Many people have been clamoring for Athena to be a Hero ever since they released the first concept pieces and even the cinematic trailer with a white feminine-looking robot that bears her logo. She has a big presence in Overwatch and to have a character that is an AI versus the likes of other current Omnic heroes would be interesting.Queen of Junkertown (Wasted Land Comic, In-Game Junkertown Announcer)=Another fan favorite, shows a lot of personality. Not only she has a character design as shown on posters all over Junkertown, it'd be cool to have a ""royalty"" character and have other characters mockingly referring to her as ""Your MajestyHammond (Map Document Hints [Horizon Lunar Colony])= A story arc introduced but never continued after the release of Horizon Lunar Colony, be interesting to see another animal creature butt heads against our main party animal, Winston.Olympia Shaw (Recall Short, Atlas News Articles)=She has a voice actor and character model, and she could be a news reporter turned field journalist. Concept art for her have drone cameras flying around so be a cool ability to have on the Overwatch battlefields=-==-=WORSTEmily (Reflections Comic)=Tracer's Girlfriend. She doesn't really have any shown traits and abilities, let alone enough lines to convey some kind of personality. She seem rather plain Jane and is meant to be someone in Tracer's life.Sanjay Korpal (A Better World Comic, Masquerade Comic)=Like Emily, Sanjay was just meant to be another Vishkar operative alongside Symmetra. He seems like an average Joe and doesn't even seem to possess the same powers as Symmetra does.Maximilien (Masquerade Comic)=Doesn't seem like the fighting type and his design would be similar to Zenyatta in a suit. A character that, while has a specific personality and role, is best kept in outside media, not in gameSam (Reflections Comic)=Pharah's dad. As much as I'd like a family dynamic, we barely have any info of him. We have more information of Hammond than we do of ""Sam"". Like Emily,he's just meant to be someone who is connected to a character outside of the gameKatya Volskaya (Searching Comic, Infiltration Short)=Highly doubtful she'd exists as a character within the game than a major plot point for Zarya and Sombra in Overwatch mediaThe Meddling Kids (Cinematic Trailer)=They're kids. Pretty sure Blizzard frowns upon killing kids in the battlefield, least if they want to keep that T for Teen rating. While people have been clamoring for them too, the most unlikely to happen. Sure Blizzard could age them but the timeline is messed enough to have the character retain their ages.Alejandra (Searching Comic, Hero Short)=Again, she's a child. Same reason for the above.Hakim (Old Soldiers Comic)=I've seen some posts about him but he seems more like a throwaway character than anything elseHarold Winston (Recall Short)=He's dead. As much as Blizzard and Overwatch characters love pulling the ""I'm dead but not really"" (Ana, Soldier 76, Reaper), Winston must have had some time on the Moon after the other subjects on base killed the scientists before escaping. That meaning he saw them murder Dr. Harold Winston. Gerard Lacroix (Reflections Comic, In-Game Mentions)=He's dead, like above. Widowmaker visits his grave in the Reflections comic which means there was a dead body to bury unlike the Return from the Dead trio who were assumed dead since their bodies were never recovered. Unlikely that Overwatch would pull a Zombie character on us.Mayor Nandah (Uprising Origin Short)=No.Guillermo Portero (Sombra ARG, Castillo Arena Map)=No.Lynx Seventeen (Searching Comic)=While a cool snarky character, his design is very similar to Zenyatta's and we already have a Hacker character=-==-=Let me know of your personal opinions or if there were any other characters that I have missed to mention. Of course, if you feel like someone should be or shouldn't be a hero let me know why!","

"Sanjay Korpal is one of the worst? Nope, he is probably one of the best. In Moira’s origin story, you can see him sitting on the far left of the Talon leaders’ table (and that is very clearly him). In Masquerade you can also see him at the Talon leaders’ table next to Doomfist (albeit not as similar). Why would a ‘background’ character appear in three different pieces of media?

Especially when in Asia it's a last name first bases.  Since people seem to be Liking what I've been speculating, it if is Liao, I'm going to add this as my speculation as to what his kit could be. 12/29/2017 08:33 PMPosted by TidalWavesI've been batting ideas around since the summer and i posted this in another thread and people seemed to like it, so I'll add onto it. I'll also admit that I'm writing things on AO3 involving both characters mentioned on AO3. Ideas for speculated Hero: Fan design WIP based off a pannel of the first strike panel, the blue visor guy from the recall short AND a hero concept : https://tidalwavesstudio.deviantart.com/art/The-missing-founding-Member-Blackwatch-Liao-WIP-707836001Name: Lee LiaoCallsign(s): Phantom, Lotus, Helio, Rey Leon(Lion King) Age: 48 approxGender: maleBirthplace: SingaporeLanguages: English (fluent), Mandarin Chinese (fluent), Malay, ocassionally uses ""Singlish"", Usually when annoyed and most often under his breath, Omnicode/ Omnic Script (Due to his implants). Rank: Captain/ Blackwatch Second in commandAffiliation: Singapore Armed forces & Lion force/ Overwatch and BlackwatchLocation: Went MIA prior to the Zurich event (Hiding in safehouses in Asia and South East Asia. Rarely visits Singapore unless Talon activity is observed)Specialization: Tech/Robotics ExpertClass: Tank or Def HeroHealth: 200 or more depending on classWeapon type: Modified SAR model rifle.Primary fire- Pulse Fire:Clip size of 15-20 with an average to slow reload time (again depending on class)Secondary fire -Plasma shot:Clip of 3-5 that does more damage but with a 20-30 second cool down timer.*Other Abilities: see bottom notes.Ult: 愿狮子保护我 / ""May the lions protect me""An ult in where he calls two lion mechs/ robots to his side, the male Jiù zhǔ (Savior) casts a small shield from his right shoulder while the female Yōulíng (Spectre) does something more offensive maybe, like a damage over time weapon like a flamethrower?Backstory: Liao's Pre Overwatch Life is known to few, but those who do know know that the man was a genius who had earned several degrees (in Biotech -implants for domestic and militaristic use, and prosthetics- and Robotics engineering) and opened his own company before 18. In that time he created two miniature Lion drones to preform simple scouting tasks.When he turned (**)16, he and several friends joined the SAF as reservists where they trained and eventually fought on the front lines, helping to holding down half of the island nation while trying to reclaim the other half from the Omnics. During that time he would go on to lead and form a small special forces group called ""Lion Force"", which remained operational after the Omnic Crisis. After the liberation of Singapore, Liao was sought out and asked to become a founding member of Overwatch despite being the youngest member at 18 years. His quick wit, stealth and drive to finish a mission using any means possible earned him the respect of Reyes who later asked him to help form the covert ops group Blackwatch.Sometime the golden age of Overwatch he worked Closely with Mei, eventually earning her ire and distrust when he stole Cyrogenics research in an attempt to weaponize it. This began to further go down hill with the eventual departure of both McCree and Genji. As Tensions grew in Overwatch, Reyes was deemed to be unfit to continue leading Blackwatch, but when Liao went to relieve him of his duty, a fight broke out with Reyes taunting and threating Liao, which only caused the Singaporean to stab the older man and start a fight.Both men escaped with their lives, but Reyes was greatly wounded while Liao had lost his left eye and was partially blind in his right eye after the older man had shattered his visor.Luckily he had been developing a new kind of implant/ cybernetic prosthetic to help those who had lost their sight trough various means, as well as to help the military by providing them with an ocular lense that included a Combat HUD. With the help of Mercy he became the sole test subject of his new occular implants and spent years improving and updating the combat software and rotating around safehouses while making ""hit and run"" raids against Talon. Eventually he managed to track down Ana and helped her recover as well, disapointed that she did not accept his offer for an ocular implant like himself. After recovering in Singapore, he left, returning only once durring the ""Bras Basah"" incident in late 2076 where he took down a small taskforce of Talon agents with his Lions. The only knowledge of Liao's status at that time was the two large gold Lion mechs. After the incident, Singapore's security tightened even further, making life much more difficult for Talon.In mid to late 2077 Liao was once again sighted in Lijang China, and recognized when his accent slipped while he left out a string of ""Singlish"" as he fought. His identity was confirmed when a Talon operative pulled his visor up off his face. Luckily Mei was able to step in and aid in Liao's escape.Once again his whereabouts are unknown, but based on his actions against Talon he is willing to answer the recall. It's speculated that he's close to 50 years of age.Due to his implants, he can read Omnicode, something that only augmented humans can read and understand. He's known to be somewhat shy and flustered around cute women but there are rumors that he and Mei were once involved and she helped him to largely overcome his shyness towards women. He can be spontaneous, and is a self proclaimed ""savage, Sarcastic, $#!t giving @$$#073."" He likes to keep busy and keep things interesting as he'll ""go crazy"" otherwise. Outside of a charm his mother gave him as a child, and a dragon bracelet givent to him by Mei, he wears no jewelry outside of his SAF and Overwatch dogtags. While unmarried, he wears a ring on his dogtags and gets rather moody when asked about it.It's extremely rare to see him outside of his uniform or in a short sleeved shirt. On his right arm he has a tattoo of two chinese Lions and a dragon in black white and red -basically a tattoo with no color and basic shading- that runs from his shoulder to his elbow, a sign of drunken dubachary with is Lion force Squad during the Omnic crisis.*Now As i said this is just something I've been screwing with for the last few months and I have little idea of balancing I have no idea which of his abilities would be overpowered a friend and i were discussing things and we agreed that maybe instead of both Lions maybe he could switch between Lions like Sym does with her ult, or he could command the Lions separately to more minor effect as an ability or something. It could also be possible to cancel his ult maybe if you take out one of his lions putting them on any abilities using them on a cooldown? the thread I previously posted this in liked the idea of two lions and there seems to gen a small group who want a hero that uses a flamethrower. Some people Like the idea that Liao could use his lions independently -outside of an ult- and destroying one could roleblack him or prevent him from using his ult until the Lion's cooldown ends.Again I have no idea what character balancing is, and i'm just messing about with ideas.**Long story short, Singapore has mandatory enlistment, so that they're ready in any situation. some countries allow you to join the army Reserves at 16 whereas in Singapore minimum age to enlist as a reservist is 16 and a half. In the omnic Crisis they likely dropped the minimum age to 16. i posted more in a thread titled ""whatever happened to Liao"" Trust me, I've really expanded on the possibilities of Liao's backstory, abilities and such, but I tried to keep things brief in this post.","

"I don’t know how some of these things happen but any of you die in super unlucky ways that can almost seem to unlikely. Or just so dumb ?Most of these happened when I was invis with Sombra. I was running behind a Winston and he turns around and turns on his Tesla gun instantly making me visible and then started to kill me. In the death cam it shows him try destroying his own widows poison trap and continue to try shooting it then I run by and his gun auto shoots me . Another time I almost felt like this was too impossible, but we are on Anubis and defending, their team is outside the point A enterance and I was invis going to run outside to hack the health packs. The team had no Hanzo or widow to uncover me yet a Roadhog manages to hook me. I was completely invisible since it takes a second to go invis and on the replay shows the hog just randomly hooking into the air, then grabs me, like was he just testing out his hook at the air or was he expecting someone to just come through the enterance... What are some unlucky or dumb ways you have died?","

"One of the main problems with CTF in Overwatch is that there is 2 objectives: defend your flag or capture the enemy flag. In a team based game where staying together is key, this doesn't work so well. Here are my ideas to add a version of CTF that would work even better for Overwatch.Players have to take the neutral flag which spawns in the center of the map to the enemy base, which converts it to that team's flag and can now be captured at your base. Once the flag is converted, it is basically CTF like how we have now except only with one flag.Neautral flag spawns at the center of the mapScore by taking the flag to the enemy base to convert the flag, then take the flag back to your baseUsing any ability while carrying the flag will drop the flagCannot pick up the flag while any ability is activeNo flag returns when the flag is neutralOnce your team has converted the flag, the enemy team can return the flag, which sets it back to the center of the map and makes the flag neutral againFlag pickup time: instantFlag dropped lock time: 3 secondsFlag return time: 3 secondsWhen the flag is captured, it resets to the center and is locked for 10 seconds2 roundsFirst round time: 6 minutesFirst round ends early if a team scores 3 flagsSecond round time: same as first round6 flag captures to winOvertime bar should not freeze if the currently winning team is the team holding the flag at the end of the second roundSudden death on draw","

"Massive downvotes inc as this forum love low skill ceiling heroes being able to have massive impact, like Mercy& Junkrat.First, I want you to watch this video in the time I linked it, so you truly understand the context, the engagement, and how does it feel to fight a Moira, incase you don't play DPS at all, you won't really know how it feels.https://youtu.be/lgL0Er3UAQg?t=382That video comes from Kragie, a proffesional player currently in London's Spitfire academy team, which will be playing Contenders, a league below OWL, consistently top10 tracer player, Rank1 multiple times, incase you say ""bad dps""Here we go, this is gonna be explained with plenty of details1- The first argument people say when trying to defend Moira is :""DPS players are just mad because finally a support can fight back""Wrong, it's not the fact that Moira can fight back, it's the fact that Moira has ALL the advantages and her kit sets her to win the fight vs the majority of the DPS RosterAna can fight back, she can land 3 shots on you and you're dead, or 2 and a Nade, or land the skillshot known as Sleep Dart and kill you.Zenyatta can fight back, he discords you, rightclick you instantly oneshotting you, or simply left click headshot you once and bodyshotting onceZenyattas in the OWL have massive impact, even getting 3-4 kills per fight and carrying, as shown by JJonak vs Seoul Dynasty.Zenyattas in the OWL take the 1v1 duels against Tracer and they do win them with a decent percentage, Rawkus shut down SBB during World Cup plenty of times.Lucio can fight back, he's incredibly hard to kill and since his projectile speed increase he can land headshots on you and take you down.What's the difference, all those require SKILL to win against a DPS.Moira doesn't have to aim, she has a 6s CD on one of the best mobility abilities in the game, she has insane HP drain, range, and 100% accuracy damage, an orb to fully top her if she's under pressure.A support is not meant to have THE EDGE when engaging a DPS in a fight, he should be able to defend himself and win if he is the better player, like a good zenyatta does.2- Stats, Moira has completely replaced Mercy in the top1 hero across ALL ranks.She is oficially the most picked hero in the game as of right nowHaving 11% pickrate in GM and 55.72% winrate, she's really not that far off Mercy that used to have 15%+- pickrate.Having 11% pickrate means she is close to be in almost every game, and still manages to have almost 56% winrate, as she will be in both teams the winrate can't be much higher as one has to lose.3- Excels at TOO many things and has no weaknessesAna: used to have the best healing potential, a high impact ability in sleep dart, and a high potential to make plays with Nade.0 mobility, no sustain apart from nade which is a long CDZen: very good utility with discord, crazy damage potential, best support ultimate0 mobility, gigantic hitbox, no sustain as regen doesn't work in combat, low healing outside of TransLucio: good utility with speed and boops, good mobility, good sustain.Low healing outside E, people have to be grouped up to make his healing effective, sub par ultimate as there's too much damage in the game and Trans is much better, low damage compared to other supports, slow building ultimateMoira?Best heals in the game, fastest charging ultimate, best survability in the support category, 2nd best moblity among supports, very useful ultimate specially if combined with a good tank frontline, ability to completely zone out flankers, ability to win the fight against the majority of the DPS roster, ability to finish off kills with ease, ability to put pressure with damage orb, ability to combo healing+ healing orb doing insane amounts of healingWhat's the tradeoff? basically nothing, with ana you trade amazing heals and utility for poor mobility, with zen you trade amazing damage potential and best support ult with poor mobility, a giant hitbox and low healing4- Skill needed to be impactfulZen is technically OP by looking at his winrates, pickrates, tournament play and overall utility in the gameHow many people do really complain about Zen? How many ""Genji mains"" complain about zen?Transendence completely nullifies dragonblade's impact, making it useless.Do you see any outcry of genji mains crying about it and making countless posts about it? I don'tWhy? Trans is a slow building ultimate, more or less, unless you are one of the best zens in the world and get headshots nonstop every fight, which doesn't happen and if it does, it still doesnt build as fast as Moira's.Zen trades off 0 mobility, a gigantic hitbox and low healing for the best ultimate in the support category.Zen has the highest kill potential out of any support, do you see people complaining about getting killed by Zen? I don't, why?Zen takes a lot of skill to land the shots, so does Ana with sleep darts, hence they deserve to have such impact.Moira has no real mechanical requirement, her beam doesn't require aim, just looking at the general direction of the enemy, her healing isn't exactly very mechanically demanding either, her orbs also take next to no skill, and she has a 6s CD skill that gets her out of danger and allows her to gain range to keep distance and drain HP back.5- What can be done to make her balanced?Reducing the amount of HP drain per second with the damage beam ( Most important change needed )Increasing Fade cooldown to 8 seconds from 6.Increasing the points needed to get ultimate, making it slower to charge.What does this mean?Moira will still be able to zone out/kill flankers/DPS, as she still retains her range, and damage.However Moira will not be able to duel DPS heroes mindlessly knowing she will win, as the HP drain is reduced and they could OUTDPS in an easier fashionHer ult charge would be on par with the rest of the heroes, specially support heroes.Players would need to think when is the right time to fade, instead of spamming fade as soon as there's any danger as it will be back very fast.This is basically it, now I know people are gonna comment the typical arguments, haha tracer/genji main, moira is not OP because... I have fun with her! and the rest of the poor arguments that they bringGo on, I really don't care about your poor arguments, this post will be checked by the people that matter, I'm pretty sure they're aware of the issue anyways.I wrote this as Im bored with the current ranked situation, it's pretty much a joke with the onetricks ruining games. unbalanced MM, trolls and throwers, I gained elo today and didn't even feel good about it as the quality of games was horrible.I expect Moira nerfs soon, cheers!","

"Many of DOTA 2's heroes are considered low skill, especially support heroes. Some supports like Rubick (a squishy mage who can stun and steal enemy abilities) are harder to use than, for instance, Omniknight (a straightforward, tanky support with an AOE heal and the ability to turn his entire team invincible). Funnily enough, most of them have about the same impact. Some more than others, but not always. They bring different things to a team. Rubick can copy and repeat gamechanging ultimates, while Omniknight can grant invincibility to pretty much all forms of damage. It's good. Maybe if Blizzard were good at balance, there wouldn't be threads like these made on the daily because every support (and, indeed, a good deal of heroes) would be balanced.Too bad.","

"I'll play Devil's advocate and say I agree with you (I do for some of this and agree she is a bit too versatile but overall find it to be rubbish) the nerfs you suggested are ridiculous. The only reasonable one is making her ult require more points since she really does get it every team fight. If she were to get nerfed, it'd be making her HP drain only give her 20 or 30 hps a second. This way she demands for people with proper positioning to do dmg and recharge her resource over getting careless and flanking all the time. She'd be easier to kill for DPS but she wouldn't be overnerfed. Either way, she has her healing orb or a second healer to help keep her up. But aside from that and her ult charge, she's perfectly fine and is in a good spot.","

A hero based around dodging, movement and mobility (alongside Genji) is picked in a scene where people are incredibly good at aiming, with sharp reflexes. Wonder why that could be. Guess their aim's just !@#$.I think Moira's heals shouldn't cleave an entire team (she has the reverse Ana problem- instead of being able to heal a single tank up to full, she has the ability to heal multiple tanks rapidly), probably should be limited to two heroes maximum (or require more juice for healing more heroes). I also think her ult charges too fast. That's it.","

"I think people hate him because it's easy to be on the defence, pick a Bastion, and have people almost instinctively pick Reinhardt and/or Mercy to complement the pick. From there, the plan is easy, defend the Bastion while he defends the point.When you're on the attack however, coordination seems a bit more scattered. It's difficult to rally everyone or utilize counter picks to dislodge the defence.That said, he is fairly weak. I have a lot of trouble with him, personally, but I've seen better players deal with him with ease...","

"Bastion is a really good counter pick when you're in the middle of the match and lacking a good defence against tank-heavy or flank reliant comps. Most players don't see him coming, and by the time they adjust their strategy he already has his ult up and support backing him up. I've changed the course of many payload games by pulling out Bastion and he can absolutely decimate teams when unsuspected.The problem many people have is with the low skill ceiling involved when playing Bastion, because he hits like a tank. However I disagree with many people when they say he's a complete face-roll,  I believe he takes a certain amount of map awareness and decision making to be decent. A good Bastion will never go turret mode in the same place repeatedly, he will always be running around and setting up in different places constantly to catch enemies off guard.Basically to summarise, he guns down your tanks, catches your flankers by surprise, and forces you to re-think your strategy a lot of the time.","

To reach somebody for a rez that died on a roof or something that I can't reach.

"Even after the nerfs to Mercy I find myself now forced to play Moira :cI know Moira is balanced, and Mercy has the stigma attached to her still, but there's one other character who I ADORE and wish I could play. Ana.Probably one of my favourite characters EVER. I adore her story, and I love her character. Protecting the ones you love really fits with who I try to be as a person, and I love how the devs even managed to get that feeling across with her ABILITIES. Something really special that they totally nailed on the head here.Though I wish I could actually play her again WITHOUT being a liability to my team :/Ana is STILL struggling to find a place in the game after all the nerfs, even the MUCH needed damage buff wasn't enough to really bring her back. The game has just changed and evolved so much since she was last really in favour. I would like her to be a viable pick along with Moira and Mercy.So for that I offer TWO buff ideas;Increase her Ammo count to 15; make it less punishing for Ana to miss, defend herself, or healing targets where 75 hp would be a ""waste"". Ana is still the only support with as much downtime on healing. Moira's regenerates passive AND is refilled by helping attack; Ana's is used up for healing and attacking. Reloading is Ana's BIGGEST weakness for healing that gives her these weird periods of not being able to do anything to really help the team in a meaningful way. It wasn't as bad when her Grenade gave 100% heal bonus and she did 80 damage because the risk of missing and reloading were rewarded with more power. (Though they did need to be nerfed, there needed to be compensation somewhere else in her kit to make up for the 50% and 20% nerf)ANDGive Ana a healing passive based on her theme of being a ""mother"" and ""protector"" where she heals hp based on the health of the target she is HEALING using only her rifle (Grenade doesn't count) so she isn't better in 1v1 duels BUT can at least heal up chip damage and stay in fights30 hp for healing 200 or less hp targets20 hp for healing 250 to 300 hp targets10 hp for healing targets with more than 400This way it rewards skill hitting smaller targets, giving you more health AND spamming into tanks doesn't make your health regenerate super fast spamming into them. Plus it will only work healing MISSING health, not just standing there spamming into a Sentry Mode Bastion to get your health back.I think that would help sort her biggest issues of survivability and consistancy; which every support has 0 issues with. They can still be killed, but they're not just free ult like an Ana is currently.Hopefully someone up there in the sky sees this and chimes in, but I really do miss playing Ana without being threatened every comp game","

You'd think with Moira and her massive aoe healing Ana's nade could rule supreme, but with it only lasting 4 seconds now and it's long cooldown, I don't think it will be enough. Her sleep dart is simply not reliable enough to rely on it to make an impact, and her ult is lacking to say the least. Ana needs help!Make Ana great again!#maga","

(I'm also not saying Moira is overpowered, Ana and arguably Mercy lost too much impact)The problem with buffing Ana to heal tanks more is that she's already SO good at it. It's healing the lower health, and smaller characters she struggles more with that Mercy and Moira don't with their lack of aim requirements.Moira can spray and use her orb, and Mercy can triage forever. Every time you shoot as Ana you're getting closer to loading and downtime so it's MUCH harder to keep up more than 2 people even WITH her grenade in the current way the game has been balanced.And your English is spot on :P","

Ana was the only support who could keep up a lot of high health targets, now Moira can do that with less effort. Ana's ult struggles as well with mobility since it's easier now to escape from the boosted target, and when Discord is a guarantee to give someone a 30% damage reduction, why bring an ULT that is only a touch better.If they came out and said; we're waiting to see what happens to Ana after the Mercy nerfs settle, I would be okay. However it is still a sad though that Ana was SO bad for almost a YEAR before she even got her damage buffed to 70 :/I kinda get this sad feeling they're SCARED to really buff Ana because of how salty people got when she was good, without realsing that the game is 100% different from then to now. Lucio, Mercy, andBastion have been reworked, Roadhog and D.va aren't the same characters, Zarya and 76 were nerfed, Reaper, Sombra, Junkrat, and Orisa were buffed, and Doomfist and Moira were added to the game.You nerfed Ana in the perfect spot when you took the heal bonus down, and the duration of the Grenade. Now please fix her core issues so I don't get screamed at for not playing the current best support. I want to know my pick has a 50/50 chance of winning, not knowing that most games end with Ana being on the losing side 40/60","

"02/08/2018 07:20 AMPosted by GollyWizif they give her a better rate of fire and her nade can heal over time like moria she should be fine. also maybe a faster reload or a slightly bigger clipHer rate of fire keeps her healing balanced; Her current healing is 90 hps, the highest in the game. Buffing that would put her a touch too goodHer grenade is perfect the way it is; it got the much needed nerfs, and doesn't feel like a total ""Oh I win"" button like it used to. Plus can't say no to that 100 bust health. Plus I don't want every support to overlap, I like how they each have their own ways of bringing something to the table; why I want Ana's passive healing to be tied to her healing done, no other support has that effect.The faster reload or bigger clip are what she REALLY needs. Either less downtime on her healing OR to be less punishing for ""over heals"" and defending yourself.","

Unless you quick scope as Ana, because her unscoped primary is a projectile, the hitbox on it is JUST big enough that it will tend to hit a barrier rather than a friendly or enemy target","

"02/17/2018 11:33 PMPosted by Tophershe can 1 shot tracer and 2 shot any 200 hp hero and he pellets are rather large.1. only in close range and only if you headshot twice and only if the target does get healed or shielded. On a range of 55m you need 5 headshots or 9 body shots to kill a target. By 0.8 sec per shot it would you take atleast 4 sec, if you only hit headshots on that distance. And if we now also think about accuracy on that distance. Yeah. there is no way you gonna kill someone.Hanzo can 1 shot every hero 200 hp hero. Is he a good dps? Take away his scatter arrow. Is he still good?""Yeah Mei is not a sniper you idiot!"" Yeah. So you have to be pretty close to an enemy, less than 26m to deal full damage or less than 10m to freeze someone. While having no escape ability, no movement ability and the worst selfheal ability in the game.Soldier heals in a area of 5m 40 health per sec for 5 sec. Can still shot, move, ult etc. (15 sec cd)Bastion heals himself for 75 health per sec. Can still move. (no cd)Tracer can heal herself back to full health and get out of the fight/ sticky situations. (12 sec cd)Roadhog heals himself for 300 health in 1 sec and still move while taking 50% less damage. (8 sec cd)Ana can heal herself instant for 100 hp. (10 sec cd)Moira can heal herself for 75 health per sec using orb (10 sec cd) or 105 health per sec using orb and secondary.Mei only heal herself for 37.5 health per sec in a duration of 4 sec. sure she cant take damage while doing this, but she also cant move or do anything. 4 sec not doing anything and just gets 150 health back.","

"So for clarification, I wanted to emphasize beforehand that I am using Zarya in this situation. I am getting so tired of getting yelled at by my team for holding my ult. It's not because I don't want to use it, but rather when I spam ""group up"" and ""ult ready"" together, only maybe one person ever shows up (usually a healer). I had a Genji today who got furious at me for holding my ult practically the whole game, even after I tried to explain that I had repeatedly messaged that I wanted the group over a period of about 5 minutes. Only ever did Ana show up. I never knew where he was and didn't want to squander my ult. The same goes for the rest of the team I had in that situation. Everyone except Ana kept just kept doing their own solo thing. Same thing yesterday. Only my friend (playing Moira, mind you), ever really wanted to capitalize on my ultimate. I don't want to waste my ult-- because Zarya's is amazing when used correctly. But if it's wasted, it takes quite some time to get her ult back. So am I in the wrong? Should I do something else?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If you keep finding yourself waiting for a moment that never comes, yeah, you're wasting your ult by not using it. There's not much you can do to make your teammates group up better. So work with what you've got. A few two or three-man gravs is better than one that gets four.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"I mean, in most cases, just having at least one other person that can follow up on your ult effectively is enough to turn a game.

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
Yes and no. Its right to save ult but after awhile you might as well use it since in the time you hold it you could have built another. Dont be afraid if you see the chance to grav 4-6 ppl. Plus you can capitalize on grav by yourself if you are 80+ charge. And in most cases people here a zarya ult and look to find it. So just get into the mentality of I can build this back up so as long as i can use it to kill at least 2 or so its good. Dont waste it on solo though. Imo,"

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"Most flanking dps (especially Genjis and Tracers who benefit from Zarya's ult) cannot join the tank because of their positioning. They are flankers, and if you are playing with an aggressive player, they might not be able to make it to your tank's position safely.In short, it is too much to expect your entire team to group up behind you if you are not playing a Reinhardt and running a deathball comp.Instead, when you call out your ult, your Genji/Tracer should call out their ult in response and tell you if they have it (or what %). You can then coordinate your ults that way. Assuming you're not using voice and can't type to ask for someone to tell you their ult status, that's about the best you can expect.If they're not responding, hit tab and view your team's status. It will display their ult status as a checkmark below their name. You can track ults that way and hope they are paying attention to your ult line.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If nobody is coordinating with you, then figure out a plan B. If you can't orchestrate a big teamwipe (or even a couple of guaranteed kills), can you solo ult/kill a high value target? Can you pull people off of an objective or off of an advantageous location? Can you save your supports by locking down the flanker who's trying to kill them?Basically I find for me that it's helpful to not just know what your ideal circumstance is for getting max value out of your ult, but also having some options for working around unhelpful teammates. Hopefully you won't need to call on that option too often, but in solo queue you're probably gonna need it now and again.","

"1100 hours on Mercy (almost all those hours are from comp on PS4) taking a break from the game for a few reasons.1) I haven’t asked for a revert on Mercy. I thought she was OP with her double insta res during ult and needed tweaking. However, I find her so unfun and underwhelming to play now. At least with old Mercy when you pulled off a sweet res you got to feel like a badass. She’s more balanced now and still a great healbot, but there’s no longer a moment to really shine. 2) The toxicity in game is another reason I’m leaving. It is terrible on PS4. I find it amusing that people get instantly banned for a week on the forums for saying something silly like “so dumb” (no joke), yet I report someone in game for telling a 13 year old to go kill themself and nothing happens. With all the Mercy hate lately it’s been even worse. I dropped from high masters to mid-diamond, I’m female, and I have a platinum boarder...you can only imagine the crap I’ve had to endure.3) The smurf problem on PS4 is the last reason. I’ve posted extensively about this, but according to Jeff, smurfs aren’t as big an issue as we make them out to be, Mercy is fine now, and toxicity has improved...and unfortunately from my perspective, I disagree. I still enjoy watching OWL and will continue to do so, but for now I will enjoy being just a spectator.","

"02/10/2018 02:54 PMPosted by EquinoxIf only 25 other heroes and a mute button existedI like playing Mercy (obviously), and I do mute and block people. It still ruins the experience when it happens as often as it does. That isn’t Blizzard’s fault - it’s crappy human beings. I was in skirmish the other day waiting to get in a comp match and some guy asked if I was a girl then said oh you sound like a whale. That happens all the time. Sure I mute them and chug along, but the damage is already done.","

I would love to come back if Mercy gets the changes she deserves (and I agree that is not a revert), but I don’t see that being any time soon based on what Jeff has said and historical evidence.I would also like to add that OW really needs an evidence-based report system. I used to take the time to make Twitch highlights of throwers after games and include the link in my reports. It was pretty frustrating to find out no one reads the reports and punishment is based off of # of reports.","

"Hello, I'm Robo. My favorite hero in Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support is Tracer, Hanzo, D.Va, and ZenyattaMy main is TracerMy favorite ability is Pulse Bomb, its so satisfying to stick :DFavorite skin is a tie between Cadet Oxton for Tracer and Soldier's Alpine. I would like to learn Widowmaker.My tip for playing Tracer would be to never be under 120 HP. Ever. 125 if they have Hanzo. I think having a meta is okay, but I would rather it not be there. It doesn't have as much of an impact in the matches as people think. My favorite OWL team is probably NYXLI watch KarQ and Erstadan, KarQ is my favoriteI think people play tank the least. I think people don't play tanks as much because there's not too much feedback, like with DPS you get the elims and with support you get the healing, utility, and saves, but with Tanks (not D.Va, Hog) it just feels like doing nothing half the time in my opinion.

Sanzang (i think thats how you spell it) for ZenyattaWhat hero would you like to learn? Moira or WidowmakerIf you could give someone a tip to playing your main what would it be? Please for the love of God remember to use Fortify. It can stop a lot of things and if I remember correctly it cuts down the damage you take.What type of hero would you like hero 27 to be? I'm guessing a tank that screws up the dive meta. Right now the only tanks that do that are in the dive meta themselves.Do you think having a Meta is a good thing? Kinda of i suppose, I mean I don't like how some treat the meta as a sacred text that must be followed.What is your favorite Overwatch League team?

"Favourite hero in each category: Sombra, Mei, Dva, Mercy Main: Mercy favourite ability: EMP least favorite ability: Tactical visor Favourite skin: Zhuque (think it’s spelt like that) for MercyWhat hero would you like to learn: AnaTip for main: Never Rez during Valkyrie, it’s a waste of time when you could be healing and you get melted. Hero 27: Defence who could be a solid counter to high mobility heroes e.g tracer, Sombra and Genji Is meta good: yes becasue it helps you win and no because it excludes a lot of heroes Favourite OWL team: London spitfire and Houston OutlawsDo you watch Overwatch Youtubers: Bro you wack and Guzzo Least played role: support and tankWhy: Supports are constantly nerfed or ‘changed’ to the pontiff where they are either underpowered or unfun to play and tanks don’t feel rewarding to play as well as they don’t have a objective other than stand and bloack damage which is dull when’s you could play dps I met a girl called Kayleigh and we are now pretty much best friends, we play overwatch together and we play other games with eachother, I met her in Comp and she added me becasue she’s liked how I played mercy and how nice and chill I was in comms. I made most of my monumental changes on overwatch with her; climbed to diamond with her And I climbed to masters with her. Got through every mercy nerf patch with her and she’s reassured me it was okay to play and she’s was still playable. We made even more friends playing together such a a girl called molly who was the nicest reaper main I had ever seen. And we’d met jake (unfortunately no longer talks to us as he doesn’t like us) but he was the most amazing dps/ tank player ever. Soon we added Ed to the list the dva main who climbed from silver to platinum. We met Gabe the most amazing Mei player ever with god Wallasey that would change the fight and save us all. I have made these friends and we are close as close could be and I woudlnt change it for the world. We grew together as players and as friends even though living in different parts of the world. Belgium, Sweden and the UK. I thank the overwatch team greatly because I would never have met these people without this game and I cant imagine life without them. We pick eachother up when we are down and even though we aren’t as close we all know when it comes to the weekend it’s ps4 party and overwatch time. We have the greatest times and Kayleigh’s laugh is contagious, jake’s jokes left us all in stitches, gabe’s sarcastic and evil comment he’d make when murdering the enemy team as Mei, Ed’s killer tunes that would pump us up for the fight, molly creativity and strategies that would get us cheesy victories and finally me, I don’t know what I did for us but they say I’m the glue that keep saying us together, I resolve disputes and make sure everyone isn’t on and has op haopy  what they are doing. And I made them laugh with my panic screeches walking back from spawn trying to get back in time to Rez or heal or something. They changes my life and it’s because of this game. I sincerely thank the overwatch team, the community for everything’s as I wouldn’t be here today as the confident and strong person I am now. I hope you all find friends and make the best memories on Thisbe game because I know I have and I wish people could to.","

"The big hooplah mostly come from one (or more):- Mercy's ult feels like it is does not have any impact in any way. Apart from flying and being able to chain within 10m, it's the exact same thing that Mercy does for the rest of her kit all the time and it cannot save a team if they're losing a fight unless it's a very very close fight.- Mercy's ult is boring to use. Same reasons above: it's just basically her normally, but flying. - Rez feels wonky to use. It makes you feel like you're moving through sludge when every other part of your kit is designed for mobility, you can't heal while using it, and you can't use it in the middle of a fight unless the person you're trying to rez died in the very back far away from the fight or they died behind a wall.Almost none of her kit requires any thought or planning now. Any. Whatsoever. It took away what little bit of decision making Mercy once had. Are you starting a team fight and a few people have low health? Okay, use Valk and stay in the skybox for 15secs. Is someone dead, no one on your team is in need of healing, and the enemy can't see you? Okay, use rez.","

She now has a niche and its not always useful.Which is bad, because everyone mained mercy because she was always viable with and aggaints every comp, she rewarded good players and punishes those who didn't know how to play her (except for the sr exploit).Now she lost that and its sad to see how she is useless in ult form.","

There are multiple heroes who can shield you while you res. I've seen it done before with my very own eyes, shielding Mercy while she res's. Teamwork!

They'll be targeted even while glowing, and they won't be able to react on time once they can move.-RIP Tire. Hide somewhere safe, then go for the kill.-Rocket Barrage. Normally a suicide button, against a team that's standing still and can't react on time, you have the element of surprise.-Self Destruct.

"Correction, only her standard kit is in a good place (e.g. healing, damage boosting, pistol usage although very rare, guardian angel with bunny hop) but her ultimate is no where near in a good place. It's simply a spectating ability and must be one of the most boring and least impactful ultimates in the game at the moment. It doesn't even deserve to be called an ultimate. Resurrect as a standard ability, in its current state, is pretty much a suicide button if your team doesn't defend you near a fight.","

"Let's look at it like this: do you ever dread having to use recall? Deflect? Defense Matrix? Boop? Because that's how a lot of people feel about rez; it incapacitates you to the point that you spend 2 seconds wondering will I survive this? The only ones I know who feel anything similar are Hog and Pharah mains who uses their ult, and those players often avoid using it because of the vulnerability. However, the risk of them comes with the potential to more or less team-wipe, and they still do damage and can somewhat defend themselves. Mercy players lose all agency when they rez, and the reward isn't even that great since if the Mercy dies immediately after the rez is completed the rezzed person often dies as well. And, unlike a Pharah or Hog that doesn't use their ults, Mercy players are often subjected to hate when they decide it's not safe to rez and get called throwers. Nobody should have to fear using something that the devs apparently envisioned as part of her regular kit. If something has to be put on such a long cooldown and have so many restrictions it's just not meant to be an ability, period.","

"#1. We should have Save (overwrite) and Save As as separate options.It's great that we can save configs now. However, I find it really weird and awkward that when I need to edit a config, the only option I have is 'Save as' (even though it's called Save), meaning that when I edit a config and save it, I'm offered to save it as a new one.90% of the time I just need to edit an existing config, not to have a new one. It's only natural that we should have separate Save (overwrite) and Save As options, because Save and overwrite would be used much more often.#2. When I edit a config and choose Save As, the suggested name for the config should be based on its current name, it shouldn't be my nickname.In addition to that, I find it very awkward that when I edit a config and then save it as a new one, the default name for the config is my nickname. When I'm saving from an existing config, it would make much more sense if the default name would be derived from the name of the config I'm editing. I.e. if I'm editing ""FFA Random Heroes"" config and choose Save as, the suggested name should be ""FFA Random Heroes (1)"", not ""Jekyll"".#3. Do not allow to have several configs with the same name.The game should NOT allow to have several configs with the same name! It only creates mess (especially since without save/overwrite option and with the default name being your nickname you're bound to accidentally create configs with the same name). The game should always offer a different name and should not allow the same name.I know it all might seem like minor things but when you often practice or have fun in custom games alone or with friends you often have to introduce small adjustments into your configs, and the current system makes it really awkward.","

"02/18/2018 04:42 AMPosted by RaymondWhen you save an edit of a config in custom games there is an option to make a new save or to override it to an existing one.No. There's an option to select and apply a saved config that will overwrite the currently selected settings only (which essentially isn't even an overwrite, it just applies the settings from the selected config), but the saved configurations are not altered in this process whatsoever. To alter configurations you have to use the Save button on the right. Which functions as a Save As button. When you press it, you indeed get a menu that lets me select a config to be overwritten, but it's an exceptionally weird and awkward way to do that. Why would I need to manually select a config I want to overwrite, then manually enter a name for it (because it suggests my nickname) instead of just having a ""Save"" option that doesn't ask me anything?In other words, all three of my suggestions seem valid for me.","

"Sombra isn't being buffed against Reinhardt, so this is just about her being in more games, right?Well, if she does show up more often, she'll be replacing a DPS. That DPS may be the Junkrat or Bastion who's been shredding your barrier recently. Or it may be the Tracer or Genji who's attacking your backline, ignoring your barrier entirely.Sombra can only hack one hero at a time, so if your barrier does get hacked, your off-tank can step in with their abilities. You can also body-block damage with your large, heavily armored health pool. Sombra's weapon has not had its damage buffed, merely had its spread reduced, so it isn't any stronger against tanks. Her rounds are also in just the right range for your armor to mitigate its damage. Most likely whoever she's replacing on your enemy team would have had much higher DPS than she does.To be honest, if I were tanking against a Sombra, I'd rather be a Reinhardt than an Orisa. A smart Sombra (dumb Sombras won't get much done) will hack Orisa right when her barrier needs to be refreshed; this leaves her with a barrier that's about to break, a smaller health pool than you, no Fortify, and a primary fire which is less suited to shooting agile heroes at close range and which slows her down when she's using it. I think you're going to be more effective hacked than she is. And a hacked Winston is a giant, lumbering hitbox with a tickle gun.","

"02/18/2018 03:29 AMPosted by LafMy real issue is that he can’t heal tanks well at allWell yeah, that's kinda his big weakness.But to be fair, what other weakness does he really have ?He's faster then Tracer, more mobile then Genji, has crazy good self sustain if you know when to amp up, and if he has all of his team around him - he out HPS Ana or Mercy without even needing to Amp up.Even his damage is decent now - a full hit of headshots + melee + boop can burst down a 200 HP hero.He's not really a good pick for a solo healer if your team is Tank Heavy, that's true - but on a team that is less heal intensive (I.E, you've got a Hog as a tank) you're gonna do fine more or less.","

"I started playing him too last night and he is a blast to play.Yes, I was having issues at first with maybe 3K match heals but towards the end of the night I was getting 6-7K'ish(of coarse length of match plays a role).  Maybe with more practice I'll get higher.I noticed the tank healing issue at times.  One thought is that his heals could be based off of a proximity box.  Stick to the tank like glue and he heals a lot quicker?  Outside that proximity box and things heal as normal.","

"The issue is more with the map design of Junkertown as opposed to Bastion. People try the pirateship here and there on other maps, but it is easy to break with a smart engagement (e.g. on Route 66 first point defense), thanks to the map allowing for it. If you get the Bastion off the cart literally once, you've beaten it. If they try to force it when the cart has rolled up far enough already - they are essentially throwing. (Since the walk from spawn to cart will be too long).I have had good success on Junkertown playing a Hog on defense. I've gone on a flank and hooked the Bastion (or Mercy) from the right side house, before they have set up (but not showing myself too early), and getting that initial kill while still having the access to the cover of that house if need be. Their team will sit on the payload and push it for a little bit before they are taken out in the teamfight, which ideally makes their subsequent setup really hard since the travel to the cart is longer and your team can play corners better without them pushing the cart.Of course there's other ways, but yeah.","

I can see where it may seem unbeatable. But it isn't. It's a team effort to do it. It takes more than YOLO trickling to break it.

"Hero experience and proficiency aren't taken into account when the matchmaker assembles teams, and this is a big problem.  We might have a single SR/MMR score but the unfortunate fact is we don't play all heroes at the same level.BTC does a great job of summing up the biggest issue in matchmakinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtMr1IjQ_E4&t=345s (go to 2:18)I don't quite agree with his proposed solution as it seems too complex for this game and would require overhauling the player experience.What I think instead should happen is, when the system is putting a team together it looks at the heroes each player can play at or near their level.  It then filters out problematic team compositions based on this and doesn't let them form in the first place.  The matchmaker system needs to ask itself one simple question before it commits players to a match, ""Can these guys put together a workable team?""Is it about to put 2 Mercy one-tricks in a team?  NOPE, pull one out and swap in someone else.  5 DPS-only players?  Pull 3 of them out and put them back into the pool.  (You could at least swap them for one of those Mercy one-tricks from the other game!)Tired of playing your hero, want to switch and don't want the system to assume you're permanently a D.Va main?  Play alternate heroes in quickplay and improve your stats on them.  Then when you queue up for a competitive game, the system knows you're good on heroes X, Y and Z, and takes all of them into consideration when it puts teams together.","

A good example is, How often are you in a game and someone clearly is not good at what they are playing but wont switch? I would love to see an option to OPT OUT of games that will have grouped people in it.

"I really feel that instead of changing RP entirely, all they need to do is look at DF as a combo character, instead of a one-shot character. Somewhat like this:-Rocket Punch: wall damage changed from 50-150 (depending on charge) to 25-50. When hitting a wall, the enemy is stunned from 0.5s to 1.25s depending on charge.-New addition to his passive: when hitting an enemy with an ability, the cooldown of the other basic abilities is reduced by 1s / 1.5s.With this changes, he becomes a character that is able to use more his abilities and combo them. He would also have more survivability, because of the extra mobility and shields he would get. He wouldn't one-shot people anymore (except Tracer), but he would have the reward that is stunning the enemy and being able to finish him off with his gun or other ability. The fact that he wouldn't one-shot ppl would also make it easier to increase a little bit the hitbox on the punch without causing an uproar on the crying babies of this community. Much better overall, more fun and less frustrating to play against. In addition to this, if he happened to be too strong, just reducing the damage on his Uppercut or SS slightly would be enough. Also, his ultimate should reset the CD on his basic abilities, or atleast activate the passive.","

The problem is, it gives a small push, its and ultimate that doesn't really do much. You yell I WILL WATCH OVER YOU and then you watch as your team dies if even one enemy uses an ult.-It lasts too long so it can't be buffed without becoming over powered.-It automatizes her teams hp management -Its healing is substandard for an ultWhat I'd like to see is either1. Reset cooldown on res, no other changes to res, no lowered cast time, no double charge, only reset the cooldown on res.or2. Increase healing/damage boost the closer she is to an ally.

Remember Platinum is still above average.Obviously further nerfs is something we all want to avoid. If she were to revert, I'd want to keep a lot of the positives of the rework with her, and try and avoid a full revert. I don't want to bring back the days of hide and seek Mercy, ""Kill her 1rst or kill her 11th"", and the old rezzing an entire team from the next room over.I propose:Ultimate (Rez) gets a cast time and a LoS requirement.New ability is Valkyrie, granting Mercy the ability to fly on her own and increasing the speed of her guardian angel.OR Valkyrie could chain heal or damage boost. When healing, the first target is healed for a higher HPS.Even if my ideas end up being bad or poorly balanced, I'm still afraid I have to side with the people that want her reverted. You can't balance a 30s rez without nerfing her into the dirt, and I don't think that's a situation anyone wants.","

She would still have the extended beam and GA-reach, but she would have to actually fly to the bodies to rez them, making ""hide n rez"" impossible and easily countered by either focus fire or an ult like Tac-Visor or High Noon.Her new E could be a high jump (similar to Pharah's rocket jump, but slower) with a small knockback that Mercy could use to get to high places (and boop unfortunates off cliffs), while split beams are put on her reload key and on a fairly high cooldown (15 seconds or more).

Enabling her to heal allies in danger even faster while potentially damaging the enemy going after them at the same time.Valkyrie though? It just gives you the ability to fly and make your general gameplay have a chain effect. It lacks the focus other ults have which results in everything being diluted.

						Feb 18
					",,,,,,,
"I'm not a Mei main, but i've put a lot of time into her over the past couple months. A big thing is working on those headshots with alt fire. Anyone can hit a frozen target, but if you can land one on someone pushing the supports, they're gonna back off. Tracer especially will have to be careful around you, because you can 1-shot her.If you're gonna ult, stack your freeze from your primary on Zarya first (So she cant save anyone else), then worry about heroes with Mobility. If you can stack it on Orisa then great, but if she's got fortify then there's really no point in trying. Make a habit of breaking walls quickly when using them to get to higher places, as if you die they're stuck there the full duration of the wall.Oh, and you can wall off Torb Turrets and Super chargers (as in placing the wall directly on them, not just in front of them) to stop them from functioning. (You can just use your primary fire to freeze a turret, but the wall is faster and safer, especially during molten core)One more thing: As far as I know, Mei's wall does NOT block her ultimate's LoS. So you can surprise people by throwing your ult at your wall where it cant be eaten by a defense matrix.Edit: As of right now, Moira orbs still do go through Mei walls, so just be aware of that when you wall yourself in somewhere on low HP. A Moira orb may just materialize and kill you if you don't have cryo-freeze available","

"I had put some time on mei too although im a Dva main. I can give some suggestion about habit.1.) Always use icicle as primary damage rather than secondary, because i saw a lot of mei player try to use freeze spray to chase down enemy but got themselve kill instead.2.)Wall is ur most important skill during war#teamfight. Walling off tank and other during choke point, while walling dont aim for ground but aim for side or top of door it will reduce mistake of walling too far or too close.3)Wall can cancel junkrat trap so always try to use it when trapped.I got more minor tips on mei's habit if you wish to discuss with me. you are welcome to add me.","

"<--- Top 50 Mei player w/ 200+ hours in MeiMei is a hero that needs her team to play around her, much like other niche heroes. She works best in deathball compositions (deathball meaning you have a 2 2 2 including Reinhardt and Lucio).First and foremost, do not be trigger-happy with your Ice Wall. People will try to sneak round corners and then quickly pull back in order to bait it out of you, which you do not want.On certain maps such as the Numbani point A upstairs choke point, you can get the enemy suck in the ceiling, which is actually ideal, because they're completely immobilised before you've even frozen them.If you feel that you're too far away from the enemy to get a good Ice Wall in, then save it. There's nothing worse than a wasted Ice Wall.Your cryo-freeze should mainly be used to bait out CC abilities such as Roadhog's hook, McCree's flashbang, etc when you find yourself in a 1v1 scenario. There is however a bug which causes Mei to sometimes be pulled out of cryo-freeze by these CC abilities, which gives you an even smaller window of time to predict when they're going to try and stun you.Mei's ultimate is best used for zoning, since it can cover entire objectives. It takes 3 seconds to freeze people, but can be sped up slightly by stacking with your primary fire. Try to steer away from using your ultimate when your Ice Wall is on cooldown. You can wall off the side of the ultimate that the enemy is closest to, to minimise their chances of escaping.It's possible to achieve a 10 second freeeze by freezing someone, and then dropping your ultimate straight to the floor as soon as they're frozen. With the Mei buffs on the PTR, you no longer have to completely freeze the target with your primary fire to achieve this.When you eventually find yourself against another Mei, it mainly comes down to who is more accurate with the primary fire, and who starts freezing the other first. If you start freezing first, you will force out their cryo-freeze. You can use this time to reload, as they have to remain inside their cryo-freeze long enough for the slow effect of your gun to wear off. Before they come out of their cryo-freeze, start using your primary fire on them. By doing this, you will be the first to start landing the primary fire again, giving you the advantage. When you headshot her, make sure to melee immediately afterwards to finish her off, since Mei has 250HP. The same applies to Reaper.","

I'm not proud of it. But the dumbest reason for someone to throw comes from yours truly. I dont know why i threw this game...maybe Because it happened multiple times in the last few months on comp.The reason I threw was because my team refused to communicate. Hold up I make it bad.Every game I joined someone had a mic (I know how lucky) But they never used it. Unless someone on my team also had a mic. I did but it chose when it wanted to work. This kept pissing me off game after game if we win they said nothing. But they complained if we lost.One game someone had a mic but they weren't using it. Even though there was six people in the chat. Then a miracle happened. My mic started working so i could communicate with them. They communicated back. Then my entire team put in there nice and started doing callouts. I dunno why I got triggered but I did and left them to 5v6. They apparently lost thanks to a message from a teammate.I feel bad about it and this is the only match that I have thrown. Please don't ban me:(,"

"Anchor Tank is the official definition for Reinhardt and Orisa, which partially corresponds to what we call ""main"" tanks. Together with Winston, a dive tank, we have only 3 primary tanks (4 if you want to count D.Va), which makes the situation a little stagnant. Winston in particular is by far the preferred choice in the current meta. Regardless of the next hero's identity, be it Junkertown Queen, Hammond, Liao or Mama Hong, I seriously hope it's going to be an Anchor tank with an anti-dive AoE knockup of sorts. After all he / she is rumored to be meta-changing, so it has to be a Winston / D.Va counter.","

Some people want a defense character just because we haven't had a new one since release, but true defense characters are hard to balance. Look at Bastion, Mei, and Torbjorn. Hanzo, Junkrat, and Widow are more offensive than Doomfist even is.But basically it boils down to their being about 16 dps and only 6 tanks, and 5 healers. We could always use more tanks and healers, the more there are, the more tank and healer mains there should be which is good for the game.","

"Before you start trying to attack me, it is not the reason you think. The reason I do not ship Tracer and Widow is because of one small headcanon I have: Tracer knew Widow before Talon got to her. Now you may be saying what does that have to do with anything? Well sit down my friends while I tell you a story.According to the Wiki Lena (Tracer) joined Overwatch in its early days and the age of 25 or 26 to be a test pilot for them. Then all the stuff with the supersonic Jet happened and Lena became - quite literally - a woman out of time.Now before we go any farther, let’s look at Amélie (Widow). Her bio says she is 33 but it isn’t that hard to assume that whatever is keeping her heart from doing its job may have also have stopped her from aging. We also don’t know when she was kidnapped but I suspect it was within 10 years Overwatch being founded. To be honest I have nothing to back this theory up other than that my gut tells me it was when the world still viewed Overwatch as amazing.So, with Tracer being established as one of the central agents and her proclivity for getting in people’s faces, it isn’t that hard to imagine that there would be a connection there.Now, if you don’t know Widow’s lore this is the short version: she gets kidnapped, brainwashed, “rescued” by Overwatch agents, and then murders her husband two weeks later. Overwatch thinks that the story is Talon came and murdered her husband and kidnapped Amelie again and has no idea where she is.Since I’m done with the lengthy backstory, let’s get into it.  Any good young adult knows the best food is free food. Tracer, I believe would be no exception to this. So with the wonky side effects from being disassociated with time, I believe she would probably hang out with / mooch off of her co-workers. And who better to mooch off of than a young married couple in their early thirties who are sympathetic to Lena’s case? No one that’s who. So years later, when Lena is practically another member of the Lacroix family, Amélie gets kidnapped and you know what happens after. After seeing the death and disappearance of the two family members, Lena begins to hate all forms of death and vows to do her best to never take a life. (Remember the game is non-canonical. Also if pay attention to both the Alive and Museum trailers, Tracer is never trying to actually hit. In Alive especially, it is obvious she is buying time.) You can see the anger on her face when Widow succeeds in hitting her mark.However, why does it turn to horror? Is it because of the fact that  it is a really unsettling laugh? Maybe so. But then why didn’t she fight back at all? Was Widow to fast for the girl who controls time?I think it was something more.I think in that moment her face changed to one of horror because she knew that face. Lena remembered the smell of pizza and the sound of laughter echoing through a small apartment. Of countless games of monopoly. Of Uno, poker, any game really. And of a young woman who loved her husband enough to deal with the chance of him never returning from the fight but knowing that he was doing it to make a better world for everyone including her. A young woman who make the best pastries Lena had ever tasted. A woman who was always super competitive and had an evil chuckle that both Lena and Gérard loved to imitate. A young woman who never failed to send Lena off with a breezy “Adieu, chérie”. A young woman Lena had spends months of sleepless nights searching for. A young woman who she finally found. A young woman who pretended it was business as usual. And the young woman who disappeared again.The young woman who would be Tracer’s biggest regret is staring her in the face and Lena hasn’t even recognized her. Remember the line from towards the beginning of the Alive trailer? Tracer says something to the effect of “Here to crash another party love?” This isn’t the first time they’ve met. I’m sure that even with Overwatch gone Tracer is still trying to prevent what she can. Since Widow likes to go around ventilating heads, I’m sure she’d be high on the priority list. And now she figures out that the woman who she has been trying to find any trace of is here in front of her but completely different.So I don’t think that Lena and Amélie would at any point form a romantic relationship. They might become friends again but that is unlikely because of how distorted Amélie has become and how much pain and guilt Tracer would go though just seeing her again. Also - though I haven’t confirmed this myself - Widow remembers enough of Gérard to call for him occasionally when rezed by Mercy. IN CONCLUSION:	Do I have any evidence for my theory/headcanon? Not for the bulk of it.	Do you have to like what I say? Nope.	Do I read way too much into the lore of this game? Most definitely yes,	Do I think I’m right? I very much hope so. But more than anything else I want to think that Tracer had a family. Maybe not by blood. But I want to think that she was the annoying younger sister to a group of people who loved her. Because I’m sure she had a terrible bout of PTSD after all she went through. 	So a young couple invited her over for pizza and Monopoly.Nothing was the same again.Welp that’s enough of that. Sorry for the long read and any feels this might have caused. I’m gonna go hang out in the corner now with the rest of my headcanons. Feel free to ignore me completely.","

"Damn, I've been uploading a chapter by chapter fanfic (no erotic contents) about the events leading upto the Slipstream failure and Amelie being kidnapped, and it's based on the exact same premise as yours. Here's the link and  summary: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12081678/1/Slipping-Through-The-FingersGerard Lacroix is heading an investigation that may lead to Talon, a mysterious terrorist organisation. Overwatch command has placed young Lena Oxton in the care of the Lacroix couple, and the three soon develop a family like bonding. Lena, a dull lonely girl, starts to regard the Lacroix couple as brother and sister and learns to enjoy her life day by day. One of the founding member of Overwatch, Gabriel Reyes, believes Jack Morrison is taking Overwatch in a wrong direction. In the meantime the Slipstream, a very expensive and highly publicized project, approaches its milestone.There's an error with your age calculation, though.The game is set 5 years after Overwatch disbanded. Lena Oxton is 26 presently which means she was 21 when OW disbanded.At 21 she was already a gun totting field agent with the time thingy on her chest. The OW HQ was blown up when she was 20 and I don't think any organisation would run a project the scale of Slipstream when their HQ is blown up. So Slipstream incident must have already happened when Tracer was younger than 20 years old. Again, I assume OW would not let a minor to testpilot a prototype time travelling airplane, so we can guess that Tracer was picked by the Slipstream project when she was 18 or 19. I'd go with 18 because it gives enough time for her to pilot the Slipstream, get lost in space and time, come back, have the thingy on her chest installed, and operate as a field agent. A lot of life changing !@#$s happening within 2 years.","

"Something else I would like to add. The reason some people don't mind back filling is probably because they don't experience it often. If this change were added, then the number of matches people who didn't have back fill disabled on, would see an increase in the number of matches they get back filled into, since other people have  now avoided it.","

That implies that backfilling really is something no one likes to do?Also there is the xp penalty system as mentioned previously, which works in deterring most people from leaving too many games.I don't mind backfilling from time to time, but I would like to mostly be able to play games from the beginning, y'know? I'd like my arcade time to look like something other than queuing for a minute to lose a game after 30 seconds.That's why I said some players mind it and some don't. Those who don't mind it could have this option turned on, those who do mind it could turn it off. Would you suggest something else to prevent this backfilling issue, like increasing the xp penalties or adding some other type of penalty for consecutively leaving games?

"The worst part about backfill is that it normally happens 10 seconds before the end of the match, and the enemy team has a huge snowball going. You've definitely lost.What then happens is the whole of your team will leave at the end of the match, and you'll most likely be forced to requeue.","

"While I do agree that backfill currently is extremely terrible, I don't think it should be disabled. If that happened then when someone ragequits you might as well too, because nobody is coming to fill that empty slot. I think the bonus should be granted based on time. If you backfill a match at the start of a game, then you get a small backfill bonus + match XP. However, if you join into an embarrassing stomp with 10 seconds left, then you get a massive backfill bonus. Maybe even give the backfiller the XP of the quitter.","

"I don't play much Reaper, but from what I can tell he's about as underpowered as Mei, and they are giving Mei minor buffs so Idk why Reaper wouldn't get any. -Increase his speed in wraith form by a bitWhy? Because it is incredibly easy to just chase him down if he doesn't get any healing. An increase in speed could allow him an escape or a better chance to find either some healing or his teammates.-Decrease the time it takes him to teleportWhy? When he teleports there are 2 seperate moments where he becomes a sitting duck and can easily be headshot by a number of weapons. Decreasing the time it would take for him to teleport would decrease the total time he is a sitting duck and the likelihood of him getting killed or very damaged. Its not an amazing ability in the first place so it probably shouldn't be countered so easily.They could put this on the PTR and see how it plays out. I'll try to imagine a number of reasons as to why they have not done this yet:A. They are still brainstorming ways to buff Reaper and they aren't quite ready to share them yetB. Their focus is on other heroes right now, Reaper is farther down the listC. They don't think Reaper is really underpowered, just that the meta doesn't favor himD. Their data implies that Reaper is fine how he is, so they would need more community feedback to sway them to look at potentially buffing himE. Something else entirely. Its most likely E or a mix of different things, but it was fun to think up these scenarios lol","

I really hate all the arcade gimmicks. I just want to play the regular game. So naturally weekly lootboxes are only rewarded for winning arcade games....This is really ruining the game for me. After I suffer through all the arcade matches I am just burnt out on the whole game and don't even want to touch it until I have to do it again next week.This needs to stop. Either make it so I can get the lootboxes in quickplay and comp or make it so both wins AND losses count so I am not stuck doing this BS all day long if my luck is bad.This seriously needs to be fixed,"

"There's no rush. You get a week to do them. Play your QP and comp games first, and then hit a few arcade games before you log off. Leave the arcade games until the end of your play time to avoid the burn out. Do the same thing everyday and you'll eventually get all the wins way before the week is done. I do 1 arcade game to 3 QP games. So if I play for an hour or two, I'll usually get 2-3 arcade wins per day.","

It had a huge pay off- yes. But it’s capacity to work was largely on darchig people out of place, or placers with slow reactions. The thing with rocket punch is nearly EVERY hero doomfist can KO with rocket punch- has a direct means to avoid dodge disrupt block interrupt or otherwise ruin rocket punch over and make it not work. And these are all things they can do AFTER doomfist begins his wind upThings important to keep in mind about rocket punch:It takes a minimum second to full charge the ability. It’s range and damage are based on that charge time. It slows doomfist to a crawl while charging and holding the ability.While altering his posture, lowering his head making it easier to land critical shots against him And makes him glow like a Christmas tree. And he screams like an autistic child in the middle of a REEE moment- it’s one of the loudest abilities in the game that lets you HEAR not only that he’s charging the ability, but let’s you know EXACTLY where he is while doing it. The majority of its damage requires him to knock you into terrain Specific terrain- as not all surfaces with work. And at specific angles. Because if it’s too wide of a shot, it also won’t work. And if the day happens to be a day that end in a “Y”, the doomfist player is required to roll a D20 against a picked at random skill check value to get the bonus damage. And the ability can not be aimed on a vertical axis Instead doomfist can only fire it on the horizontal.All coupled to the largest DPS hero in the game. With absolutely the most hard counters. So even when the hit box WAS generous- the ability was not not that powerful. Slam and uppercut combos to secure take downs were still the best bets- with RP best suited for escapes. The “problem” for RP- is its one of those things that frustrates poor play, and suffers against good play (like stealth characters in MOST games).  RP could “quickly” KO a player who didn’t know how to react to it. But against good players who DID? Game sense went (and still goes) a long way against doomfist. Being aware of your surroundings, and simple positioning with your team and it’s tanks are the biggest. Heroes run at 5-6 mps From the time he starts winding up. You have a literal 10-12 meter bubble of mobility you can use to reposition and break LoS. Be it terrain, or a team mate. Even hog suddenly makes a great meat bag nody blocking tank.If you can’t get around that- use your abilities. Seriously everyone has one short of like zen, even ones that seem odd. There’s obvious ones like reaper going into shadow form, Mei blocking or walling. But even odd ones- junk rat (who is also a hard DF counter, largely because of this), can toss a trap when he hears the sound. That trap will place and arm before DF can fire- and it’ll catch him. This is true for all hero’s who place things, I’ve literally seen symmetras drop a turret on the ground- and DF plowed into that. Emphasizing again these are all things they can do reactively. Rocket punch should NOT be difficult to land. It ALREADY has more draw backs than ANY other ability in the game for the most part. That’s NOT to say it needs to be the size of a freight train, but for the most part of you get hit by RP, even at launch- it was largely your fault. Doomfist is omen of those heroes (ok, like most) where if you have trouble with him you’d be benefit BIG time from playing as him to see and learn how to play against himThis wasn’t largely why I picked him up originally. It’s the same for many heroes on my list- such as tracer and Genji. I found I liked his kit so he’s me most played now overall, but I still have more hours OFF him than on him. These are all things I do often to ruin his day when I play against him. So take it with a grain of salt.","

"Rocket Punch is:Mobility, allowing Doomfist to quickly travel 20+ meters on a short cooldownA stun that goes through barriers, useful for interrupting enemy abilities and ultimatesA potential one-shot, if you can line it up with terrain A combo tool, letting you get a quick 50 damage out at close range and setting the enemy up for an easy finisher with your Seismic Slam + Uppercut combo.It isn't as buggy as people think it is.

Similiar to last year, but this time it takes 1 second or less and can take damage during pick up. My reasoning is this will make it more of a team effort to pick up the flag instead of someone swooping in grabbing it during the chaos of the defense fighting off the offense when they go for the flag. You have to work together to get it. The only time this isn't applied is in sudden death.Just my thoughts on the matter.","

I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers.

"02/18/2018 02:27 AMPosted by DløadMy friends were really curious about overwatch because of my stories. They joined this free weekend to try it out. They were not amused by the toxic community. As I played with them every game (after the first two) had a (genij) smurf wrecking my newb friends and after winning they started provoking. My friends did not enjoyed the overwatch experience. I tried to convince them that these were smurfs, but that would not hold back their decision for leaving the game. I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers. As the matchmaking queue takes an average of 4 minutes(including skirimish), which is long if you compare it to other games.Oh well, I guess your friends will just have to play some other FPS game where there is no such thing as smurfs...you know...as soon as a game like that actually exists.I would also wager a bet that not all those ""smurfs"" your friends were tearing up about were actual smurfs. You know...Overwatch isn't really a hard game to pick up. Some people, have been playing games like this since the original Quake son.","

"Just to let you know, I have posted this idea before.  But for some reason, I couldn't delete my post on a certain thread.  So this will be the second time I posted the same thing.I thought of a very rough concept a a while back on how Symmetra can increase her and her team's survivability with shields. But I didn't think it would really fair well enough on PTR. Even if it was tweaked a bit. So I thought that I should lay my rough concept here and see what you guys think. Remember Symmetra's old ability Photon Shield? How about bringing that back but rework it as a Passive Ability? Let's say for now it's called Photon Field. In short, have Symmetra technically act as a mini Shield Generator. It still works like the old, but less of a chore. Speaking of which, I'm certain that one of her utilities needs a change, but the one that I see that needs one for the time being is:Photon ProjectorFor starters, her Photon Projector may need a nerf but not by decreasing the beam's length. Rather, when the beam is out of range, decrease its extended time by half or more....And that's basically it from my point of view. Now describing the Photon Field. Have it work in conjunction with the Photon Projector and her Ultimates. What I mean by that will sound very complicated. But I still like to here your thoughts on it:Photon FieldWith Photon Projector: Within 5 meters from Symmetra, when the Photon Projecter reach maximum, her team gains 25 shield health.With Teleporter: Only when her Photon Projector is at maximum, all allied hero that passes through Symmetra's Teleporter gains 50 shield health. With Shield Generator: If Symmetra is alive when the Shield Generator is destroyed, all allied heroes within 10 meters gains 25 shield health.Pros: Unlike Photon Shield, Symmetra doesn't have to continuously give her team shields one at a time. Unlike her Shield Generator, the meter rule does not apply to Photon Field.Cons: In general, Symmetra needs to be alive for her team gain shield health bonuses.Photon Field does not stack with Ultimates.That's what I had in mind a while back. But again, it is a very complicated concept that I don't think it could work in the PTR. But I would like to hear what you guys think about this.","

"Given that she has been slowed down, lost 3 rez charges in total these past months, beaten, witch hunted, nerfed, reworked, gutted and the lot, would it be so bad if her now only 1 rez was instantly casted?For me, the main thing that makes Mercy unfun to play as at this point is her lack of feeling like you make an impact, and the consistent interruption of fluid gameplay that is her staple-to-the-floor resurrect. Making her resurrection instant at the least makes for smoother gameplay, and I don't feel it would make her much better pickrate wise because A), she still lacks utility and offers minimal contributions besides healing, and B) her ultimate is still lackluster compared to other Support heroes.And with this, it would even return to the 1.0 times of continued movement, crossing the battlefield countless times, topping off players, micro-managing your team and all without having to stop and risk your life by being sniper candy every 30 seconds. This would be warmly welcomed by most, I'm sure.

Right now, with Mercy being slowed and having a cast time, there's much greater opportunities for interplay between Mercy and her foes.

And if they are so out of position and picked, rezzing them again would only get them killed again+puts Mercy in a bad spot momentarily.If that was the case, why was this not consistently happening when Mercy had instant resses? People complained a lot about how Rein could just charge in recklessly, die, Mercy would GA to his corpse, instantly revive him, and now there's another 500 HP tank in the middle of their team who, very likely, was able to secure a kill with his own death.Even if it doesn't work, the mechanics encouraged it. Res people as soon as they're dead because Mercy can regularly get back out. This also lead to frustrating situations where Mercy would res anyone, including people who will just die, and hey, not surprisingly, people don't like to die, wait to respawn, get ressed, and then die immediately again for another respawn. Forcing Mercy to consider the weight of ressing someone avoids a lot of these incentives, either because the res won't be worth it, or she'll die in the process of bringing someone back.Resurrect is perfectly balanced where it's at. Mercy now requires coordination and positioning -- key skills, mind you -- to bring someone back from the dead, much like the killer of that ally had to work to bring that enemy down. Instant res just isn't healthy, and there's a very good reason why no other video game of this genre has instant revives. It almost always requires one player to be disabled and vulnerable for a brief period while bringing the teammate back. That system works for a very good reason and it's only natural Overwatch would adopt that for Mercy.","

They only take -5 damage against armor.Increasing his damage by 10% on bodyshots only doesn't affect TTK or HTK, so it's also a useless buff quantity.Buffing McCree is probably down to his mobility more than anything about his gun.  He's just so damn slow, and this can be really punishing if he's caught out of position by a fast moving comp.On the other hand, increasing his mobility means he needs to take a damage penalty, because he can't 1v6 a la Pine or Linkzr and be able to combat roll everywhere like he's praising the sun 24/7.","

Personally id give him roll with 2 charges and have his ult be able to be cancelled without losing ult charge but give it a 10 sec -15 sec internal cd if its cancelled so you don't get spammed with *its high noon* ALSO you only get 1 free bluff so it must be consumed on the next use.I would not buff him,"

The AoE damaging abilities of Rip-Tire, Self-Destruct and Meteor Strike just work off of exponential graphs where the exponent itself dips below 0 in order to actually hit 0, and the cutoff point for damage dealing isn't aligned properly, which could likely be due to the system rounding. That in turn produces a negative number and in turn heals instead of damages.","

"Here's a few reasons why:1) Everyone likes and respects him.

He is the literal embodiment of knightly values.5) He has the most amazing hair. Sigh.

"He is inspired by Don Quijote, likely had PTSD or at least hallucinations, and often overestimates his limits. plus, his kit in his world wouldn't always be very applicable. Ana had a thing for everyone she was an empowered woman and got her a piece of whoever she wanted. While he is the embodiment of knightly values, that plays into his unrealistic view on the world. His size is negligible in a game like this, but need I remind you this a game that is about superheroes, with ninjas that can summon a dragon probably made of hardlight and a sick best can make you heal over time.","

"I think if you're going to nerf the ult you should pick one thing about it instead of stacking multiple penalties. I'd fix its gravity, it's weird and floaty. Sure it can get places but it's annoying to control too.Junk's mine bounces its target. It's not even really a boop since they retain air control. Making it difficult to get a kill with the mines gives them even less utility since bouncing your enemies around just gives them free mobility. Maybe if targets couldn't move or use movement abilities while in the air it would be a sane change.Junkrat's trap is even more inconsistent since it requires a blunder on the enemy's part instead of your own ability to hit and the higher an opponent's skill the less likely it is for it to ever work. Forcing junk players to rely more on the trap without buffing its usability and calling that a buff is borderline cruel.","

"100/100 on the exponential ramp curve and 0 aim assist. I tend toward 0 aim assist and maximum sensitivity anyway, because I'm an old git and I was playing these kinds of things long before things like aim assist even existed (so playing with it just feels bizarre to me), but with Pharah you genuinely do want to keep aim assist either low or off entirely. Pharah needs to lead her shots, so having aim assist dragging your aim back to where targets are, and not where they will be once your rocket reaches them, isn't much help.edit: That said, my skills on console have dropped dramatically since I picked the game up on PC; it's really easy to go from console to PC but very hard to go the opposite way. So I acknowledge I may not be the best person to be giving advice on Pharah these days. That said, I used those same settings even when I was strictly only playing on console and tearing it up as Pharah.","

"Hi there! So I was thinking last time about maybe something that would make Valk less boring for us Mercy players and res less annoying to deal with than it is now (aka, feels like a chore/breaks the flow for the Mercy, and negates some important picks for the enemy team). I know a revert won't be happening, and I don't mind that much bc free flight can be fun (just not as it is now), so I tried to think of something that would allow Mercy to earn her reses and feel powerful when she ults, while still leaving plenty of counterplay for those around her. Before you read further, I know I'm no dev so ofc I'm open to critics and suggestions, and I'm fully aware it won't make it into the game, but just bear with me for a lil while lol Here ya go: Normal kit  Remove res from E abilityRes on E is a chore and goes against everything Mercy is designed for (mobility and engagement). It stops the flow, and is more frustrating imo to play against than mass res because Mercy has it every 30 seconds, no matter if you focus her down or not. In defense maps, this single ability can bring back that tank, that Symmetra, that Bastion guarding the gate/choke. Every 30 seconds there’s a free res potentially going off. With old res, if the Mercy had her res every 30 seconds, you knew she was quite something. Now it’s free. Removing E as a base ability rewards Mercies who work better (aka res is earned and not freely given) and doesn’t deny picks so easily. I kinda liked the fact that I had to think for my reses because of the cast time, because it was partly counterbalanced by the free reses I had during Valk. Now, the problem was that the previous version was OP, dragged matches on, but removing the insta res makes res feel like a chore and goes against the primary purpose for the rework (making Mercy engaging and eliminating hide and res)Keep bunny hop GA The mobility adds a layer to Mercy’s skill (and is really fun to use lol). I personally love it. Add either a mobility, utility, or heal burst ability in her E. A lot of good suggestions have been made on the forums: - Vertical hop- Temporary shield - Short aoe healingYou can find them by either reading the Mercy Megathread or searching for Mercy E suggestions. I can suggest for an E something like providing a defensive “angel cloud"" around a selected player to absorb a certain % of damage. Kinda like a reduced armor. The cooldown would be sth like 12 seconds. The cloud shines around the player, who then loses for example only 70% of what they should lose for 1 second. It works like a soft armor in a way that it absorbs 30% of damage. If used on a target not taking damage, there is no effect. Animation could be Mercy swinging her right arm and extending her hand toward the player, thus sending a biotic cloud toward them. Note: the ability can’t be used if there’s no one, and Mercy can’t use it on herself. It targets people like GA or Nano Boost aka you can’t launch it into empty space. (An alternative would be for it to be launchable into empty space, like Ana's nade or Moira's healing, aka the hitbox is generous but you can still waste it somehow) Valkyrie Duration reduced to 10 seconds 15 seconds is fine for the ult as it is now, although it feels boring. But if you add res to Valk, 15 seconds would be too long/OP.Speed nerf is kept Infinite ammo is kept (useful to defend herself while going in for a res or taking down pharah/widow, but it's not all that necessary either) No more constant self-regen (Mercy could have the angel cloud around her for a small period of time if it's not enough) Beam range reduced to 35-38 meters to avoid Mercy sitting in the skybox Chain healing: base target gels full 60 hps; surround teammates have half that value  It encourages prioritizing, rather than just sit and hold left click to heal/bost everyone at the same time Res: sits on the Q buttonThere are as many res charges as there are teammates down when Mercy activates ult (one charge per teammate, usable only once per teammate). If 3 teammates are down, Mercy has 3 charges and not more when she presses Q. No cast time/slow movement, but the range is the same aka 5m + LOS needed. So if 3 people are down, she gets her 3 charges, one for each player, and she has to press Q as if it were her current E. (imagine the number of charges in the middle of her ult while it's activated, like Sym's TP charges). If someone dies during the ult, they are not granted any res charge. That way, you can’t res the same guy 5 times since each teammate has one charge, and if the teammate respawns before Mercy saves them, she loses the charge accordingly. That way, a 5 man-res will be a lot harder to pull off, and if pulled right will show great play from Mercy. No more unkillable moth sitting in spectator mode; you get to have your impact, and you have to stay close to your teammates to work well. Counterplay will be to kill Mercy or keep ults, like for the old res ult. Since Mercy has to dive in and individually res, the res-ed teammates have to fend for themselves in the meantime and can be killed again of focused down. Also, if Mercy is hacked, she can't res, obviously. And she's not invincinble. No self regen -> focus fire on mercy. If she pulls of 2 reses out of 5, kill the last two for free ult charge.Mercy can now choose whether she wants a reactive or proactive res. 5-man-res will be incredibly hard to pull off with focused fire, but tempo-reses will be rewarding, all the while keeping the Valkyrie chain beam setting and encouraging prioritizing and decision-making. It’s more active overall, you don’t just ult and sit in the skybox, and you encourage enemies to save ults instead of blowing them all up → slower, more organized fights, and less “who can blow the most ults” fights with 3 people racing for potg. Typical counterplay would be to either keep D.Va, Mcree, or Soldier ult when Mercy ults, or a good Widowmaker waiting for her to res, or Sombra. Contrarily to old res, you won't have 5 people back at the same time; they'll come back as fast as Mercy can res them. Without the healing she provides during a res (and since the chained beams are only 30 hps), a newly resed teammate can be focused while Mercy goes for a res. If the Mercy pulls it off, she played well, considering she has no regen and doesn't go at the old valk speed. Early picks also won't be denied, and getting that important pick on a tank will feel significant again. Feel free to comment/criticize, as long as you remain polite. I'm not a high level player nor a developper, I'm just wondering about a solution that could potentially satisfy everyone aka feel fun and good and rewarding for Mercy while still not being frustrating for the enemy team. I can understand how old res was frustrating (although keeping a few ults can save the res, or baiting the res, the enemy team was often weakened after the fight) even though I personally loved it. It made me feel heroic, which I rarely feel now with Valkyrie. But I feel like this could work to raise the skill ceiling to Mercy (while still making her accessible, she's not supposed to be a 3 stars hero) and make her fun while still being counterable. Now, it would also mean that ""atmosphere-wise"", it wouldn't be safe to rest if Mercy isn't dead after a teamfight. It would mean that you have to stay on edge for a res like with old res or old valk. But I personally think it could work...Thanks for reading through it and have a nice day guys!

I believe there’s an issue with deflecting orbs if it’s not coming straight at you when you deflect. It happened to me where I tried to deflect it sideways just to see what would happen in a custom game and the animation and sound went off but the orb stayed Moira’s.,"

It famously happened to xQc. It’s a different issue entirely. Reinhardt’s Earthshatter has a lingering hitbox. You need to hold your shield until the hitbox is inactive, and then you can drop it. It feels weird, but you can easily play around it. If you are missing your shield timings, remember that Reinhardt’s shied also has a small startup window where he actually moves his arm for his shield to come up. Earthshatter can’t just go through a stable Reinhardt shield as far as I’m aware of.","

If he got buffed like this it wouldn't allow him to one shot baby dva or tracer and it wouldn't take three to kill a 200 health character. 250 hp characters would still have a chance to get in do damage and get out. Doomfist would have little to worry about with this change and all the tanks would still be able to go toe to toe with him as they currently do. I understand he's suppose to be a defensive tank, but in order to make him viable it would require such a boost to his shield or hp/armor it would probably be more broken than a slight damage increase would be.","

It's not like orisa's shield is that much stronger than rein's shield. I've seen people who block way more with orisa than I have but I've also seen rein's who have blocked like 70k as well. So I feel the shields are very comparable to each other.  If rein got a defensive buff it should be to his life points with more armor being added onto his crusader armor. Seriously in honor and glory those suits take way more than 300 health and 200 armor points worth of damage from the bastion and OR-14 units.","

"the most frustrating thing about rein is his ult, it feels so broken in the way that it either 1.) just somehow doesnt affect anyone in the range on it (basicly negated without any interrupts because of some sort of invisible structure) 2.) in some cases you try to ult, get flown away by a knockback ability, but the ult is still used without affecting anyone either. everything else about reinhardt feels fine (except for the sombra buff maybe). i have mained him for a few seasons and found no problems except at his ult.","

Lucio just does a jump, Zenyatta literally ""does nothing"" and Ana doesnt even have an ult for herselfYeah but during their ult they do something more than what they do outside of their ultimate. Mercy has the same thing except it’s a short AOE chain between everyone. That isn’t fun at all. People are mixing up what people are trying to say. Like initial rework was super fun for Mercy because she did a lot of stuff and she would swoop in and Rez and do all this crazy stuff but it was broken af. Then the fun factor got ripped away and we were left with this weird state where Mercy is punished really hard for using an ability and not punished at all for using her ultimate and it became boring and repetitive because there is no actual thinking of when to use her ultimate as there was with Mercy 1.0. It’s the same thing rinse and repeat every game with Mercy 2.0 and when a heroes kit becomes stale and boring it becomes unfun and people will complain. People will still pick Mercy because she has that really strong solo heal potential still. It’s just she’s not impactful whatsoever. You can see on Overbuff clearly where the difference is for Mercy. Mercy has a high pickrate in low tier because in Plat and below Mercy can successfully solo heal if you have stubborn teammates that won’t want to switch to a second healer. That’s why her pickrate is so high nothing will change that she has a strong consistent heal and she will be picked, it’s when you look at high tier that Mercy’s pickrate has dropped below Ana that her impact is completely gone. So it shows that you can still have consistent healing but your inpactfulness and what you bring is next to nothing. Also you can see that Mercy doesn’t make any huge impact with how pitiful her on fire rate is.","

"Well I only play competitive now because I'm close to my second gold gun and I don't care about winning so it exists.Will clarify though, I am not saying I throw or troll and I do try my best. It's just that there's so many of those people that its hard to care when you lose anymore.","

"I'm also one of those people, but my situation is a little different. I used to be really into playing competitive during the first few seasons but after that I stopped enjoying it because of all the negativity in comp. So for the past several seasons I only play my ten placement games during the last week for the points bundle and to prevent decay since I'm in masters. Don't think this is how competitive is intended to be played, but I know I'm not alone in doing this. I think competitive rewards really need to be reworked so people aren't forced to play a game mode they aren't interested in to get cosmetics for their favorite heroes.Don't get me wrong though, even though I only do placements I still try just as hard to win. I'm a support main and all I want is to keep everyone alive <3","

"This new version would work like this: ►Drastically reduce the time that reaper puts to teleport        ►Pressing ""E"" shows where the reaper will teleport, and releasing that             button teleports to that location.This would allow it to use this ability to escape very quickly or to engage a fightTo cancel just press the right click of the mouse when the ""E"" key is pressedFor example you are in combat and you have to flee quickly, you aim stealthily a height and press the E key which would teleport you almost instently, and if you want to be more precise you only have to leave this key pressedSo basically replace the confirmation of the left click by releasing the ""E"" key and greatly reduce cast time.","

"Moira needs a nerf on either her close-to-unlimited range or her damage. She makes Symmetra a unnecessary character and she does more damage than Doomfist and 1/4 of the roster. Moira should be more focused around healing, but still able to survive and get some kills in. Moira should NOT be based on damage.Moira is not balanced.In my own opinion and this is separate from the subject at hand and has no correlation to her needing a nerf; this is just a personal statement. I think that as a character, being a hybrid is very problematic for her. There will obviously be more future disputes about what her kit should or shouldn't be based around in the future and it will either be changed to be around damage or heals one day.Every hero gets changed over-time by Blizzard and it's only a matter of time.","

Non-issue2) But... she does lol. Who has lower DPS? Tell me. Saying ""everyone who plays Overwatch knows this"" is not a valid point. Mei doesn't count, since she has alt fire and can freeze enemies.3) See point 2. Her damage is already very low--it doesn't need to be lower.4) Unless everyone is standing in a fairly narrow cone, its AOE sucks. She's better when she uses her Biotic Orb to heal, but because of the way the ability works, a lot of the time you're not going to be able to get maximum effectiveness out of it. She's not horrible at it, just not some amazing god-tier healer even when you're basically putting most of your focus on healing.","

"Just a little positive feedback on Mercy currently. When she got reworked back in September I wasn't too enthusiastic about the changes. I tried her for a while and didn't like it but overtime I got used to it and ended up enjoying her again. The problem I faced that prevented me from enjoying her was I could not for the life of me figure out what to do with her ultimate. It never felt like there was a time to use it. Granted she could rez again after the cooldown reset but then I just felt like I was flying around watching my teammates scatter and/or die all over again. When she got the rez nerf to her ultimate I had to figure out a way to make use of her ultimate all over again. I think my main problem was that I relied on using rez too often. She should be built on keeping her allies alive. Her allies themselves should not rely on Mercy for a free get out of jail card. That's also what's been building high toxicity against mercy. Players are hypocrites when it comes to rez. They want rez gone because of the enemy,  but the moment they have mercy on their team, they expect her to rez them at all times and get pissed when they don't. I finally figured out a way to make use of her ultimate after the nerf. When charging into capture points like hanamura or temple of anubis, I pop my ult and keep my allies from dying during the push. I probably should have figured that out a long time ago. Because I don't have to rez anyone anymore during ult or not as often as least, I don't have to swoop in at close range risking myself getting killed and then everyone else dies in the process. I can focus on keeping them alive from the start. The movement nerf during ult I don't even notice. I still move faster than walking so any speed faster than that is still good in my book. I have noticed that ever since the movement changes, she gains a lot of momentum when using guardian angel and then hopping. I love that because it makes me harder to hit when I bounce unexpectedly. Whatever nerfs they throw her way I just need to adapt to. Granted tweaks could be made but as long as they don't nerf her healing output, she should be fine. Bad Mercy players and good Mercy players will be easily distinguishable when you notice their playstyle. I am a hypocrite though. I have on multiple occasions asked for her to be reverted but now that I'm used to her, I don't mind the way she is. Any F tier characters can be made viable based on the creative use of the player. Sometimes it may not work but there are those golden moments that picking this character was the right choice. Stay positive, Overwatch players.","

"IntroductionSo I want to make it clear that I think Overwatch is a great game, and this is not a post to hate on the development team as I know that they put a lot of time and effort into creating the best game and community they possibly can, I apologise in advance if this post comes off as aggressive as I do not mean to offend anyone and I merely want to get my ideas across. As a Torb main it has been becoming increasingly difficult for me to enjoy the game due to the current reporting system, that punishes off meta choices and creative strategies, due to the large amount of mistrust members of the Overwatch community have with one another.Flaws with the current reporting systemIt is to my understanding that the idea behind the current reporting system is to get rid of bad behaviour such as, throwing, being toxic, hacking etc, by having players get banned after they have been reported for these offences a number of times. In my opinion there are major issues with the way that this system is designed. Firstly the current reporting system will miss out a large amount of players that should be banned, but aren't because they do not consistently behave badly. For example if someone obviously threw 1 in 20 games that they played they should be banned, but because only 1 or 2 people might report them in that game and because they do not throw very often, it could take them ages to get banned. In my opinion if you actively throw games you should be banned as quickly as possible, but because a thrower might not throw games consistently it could take them ages to get banned, One tricks on the other hand (playing off meta heroes) are far more likely to get banned than actual offenders, as one tricks will consistently play their hero of choice whereas an offender may only throw 1 in 20 games for example. This means that if you are one tricking a more controversial hero (like Torbjorn or Symetra) because you are consistently playing that hero every game you are likely to receive a lot more fake reports from people that dont trust you, than a thrower receives actual justified reports. There are plenty of examples of players getting unfairly banned because of people abusing the reporting system and whether Blizzard accepts it or not the game is currently a very hostile environment for those who enjoy playing the off meta heroes a lot. In my personal experience I know I have received tonnes of fake reports for playing Torbjorn even though I always try to win every game of competitive that I play. This season I began asking my teammates if they were ok with me playing Torb, to try and avoid getting reported, however even when my team “lets me play Torb” I will still sometimes end up getting notifications saying I have been reported for throwing games / being inactive, which I have never done. I was infuriated by these false reports today when I logged into my game to find a notification saying that I have been reported for inactivity / griefing in my recent games, which is complete garbage because I have been suspended for the past 4 days so I have apparently been inactive or griefing while I haven't even had access to the game. I haven’t always been a Torb main and I never had any issues before I started playing the hero and so it is obvious that I am being reported based on my hero choice. As far as I know it is not Blizzards intention to ban one tricks as it has been stated that it is not a bannable offence here https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761616812#post-2 I do not know if Blizzard is trying to improve their reporting system or not however if they truly want it to be safe to one trick a hero, changes to the reporting system need to be made.Ideas to improve the reporting systemNow I don’t work for Blizzard and I don't know if they have plans for the reporting system or not however I have spent some time coming up with several ideas which I feel would make it far more difficult to abuse the reporting system and yet increase its effectiveness for banning actual offenders at the same time. I think that to avoid people getting falsely reported a “vote to report” system should be added in. This would work as follows. Step 1. Person A is throwing the game and being extremely toxic.Step 2. Person B notices this and decides to report person A and so they click report, chose the category and type in a description of what person A is doing (like the current report system)Step 3. Person B’s teammates get a notification on their screens showing them what person B wrote about person A and can decide whether they agree with person A being reported or not. Step 4. If the majority of the team agrees with the report, person A is reported.I feel that a system like this would prevent toxic players from falsely accusing their teammates of whatever they feel like as they would require the majority of the team to agree with what they said. Sure there would still be ways to abuse this system but it would be far more reliable than the current reporting system today. If you implemented a system like this you could also make it so that a player requires less reports against them to get banned as the reports would be more reliable, and this would make actual offenders of the competitive system get banned faster. Another idea I had would be limiting the amount times you can report someone a day. This would reduce the chances of someone abusing the reporting system and falsely reporting someone as generally people would want to save their reports for actual throwers or griefers. The issue with this idea is that if you used your reports up and there was a thrower you would not be able to report them however coupled with the vote to report system I feel it would work quite well as only one person would have to initiate the report on your team and the chances of everyone on your team using up all their reports would be very low. My final idea to reduce the chances of the reporting system being abused is to introduce a way for players to commend a player of their choice at the end of the game for good teamwork, and this would award the commended player with a certain amount of reputation points. To avoid farming these points you would not be able to commend yourself or people in your group. You could then use these rep points you earn to maybe unlock an exclusive weapon skin or spray and this would incentivise good teamwork and behaviour as players would want to be commended at the end of their games. You could enable people to see how many reputation points someone has earnt on their career profile and this could also help the issue of people not trusting off meta hero picks because if someone is playing an off meta hero but  has a lot of reputation points then you may be more willing to trust them. I feel that by introducing these features if would greatly reduce the cases of false reporting and make the reporting system more reliable as a whole. That is just my opinion though and I don’t know how difficult it would be to introduce features like these. Final thoughtsIn the games current state it is very difficult to one trick an off meta hero without receiving a tonne of hate and reports and I don't think that this is ever going to change, but I do think that it is definitely possible to improve the reporting system and make it better than it is now and I really hope that this is something that is being looked into. This was kind of a long post so congrats if you made it to the end, it would be great to hear what some of you guys think about this.","

"1. No hero stacking. There are 26 heroes in the game, I’m pretty sure it would be a mystery still with 20 other choices AND perhaps raise morale knowing you’re not the 3rd Ana. 2. You change characters if you suicide within 15 seconds of being damaged. This stops tactical suicide to keep your character. 3. Ultimate charge is kept upon death UNLESS the player dies with it in pocket. This mode is entirely too reliant on selfish self preservation more than teamwork and who can cast the most ultimates. These changes should keep the mode fun yet take out the coin flip factor.","

"So, it appears the next patch to the game a few Sombra buffs are going to be introduced. Blizzard's reason for these changes are understandable. Currently Sombra is basically used as an ultimate machine, with a little bit a pick potential as well as a solid tactic to draw the enemy away from their current positioning (which has huge potential). However, The way she builds her EMP has been deemed a little unbalanced as she can rapidly build her ult from teammates getting her hacked healthpack. When a team works with this properly, this can result in an EMP during almost every major fight. Which isn't really fair considering this particular ultimate has almost 0 counter play potential.So during the next patch they are going to  do the following buffs in order to make her more of a dps than an ultmachine-10% spread reduction on gun (let her do a little more consistent damage)-Translocator time duration increase (Let her flanks have a little more time to them so goals can be accomplished)-hack time decreased from .8 seconds to .65 seconds, (This one concerns me a bit as far as counter play goes. Hacking things like Reinhardt's shield is a HUGE deal. Hacking that shield can win a team fight and if there's no time to counterplay the hack (stop it by turning shield) thats a 2000 health barrier gone in under a second.) Hack as it is can be devastating in the mid fight when of the enemy team is focused elsewhere so i can't say im fully behind this particular buff.-Hacked Health packs no longer give Sombra ult charge (this change is to kind of cement her more as that dps role instead of an ult machine)-Finally, Hacking Heroes now disables Passive Abilities. THIS IS THE ONE THAT CONCERNS ME (From one view point, Yeah, now you can finally deal with those pesky Genji, Pharah Flankers a little easier. On the other Hand, THIS WILL DISABLE LUCIO'S current song so no aura will be produced.)As it stands Sombra's ultimate shuts down EVERY SUPPORT ULTIMATE IN THE GAME (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MERCY, BUT THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN THE PATCH HITS BECAUSE SHE WONT BE ABLE TO FLY)Where is the counterplay to this from a Support Perspective? Support ultimates (Moria's, Mercy, Lucio, Symmetra) are disabled if they have been cast. And its already almost suicide to run Zen into Sombra, because her Ultimate, that has almost no counterplay, wipes 75% of zens health to where he can die from a Melee.From a support's Perspective PLEASE DO NOT LET HACK DISABLE PASSIVES, IT WILL COUNTER EVERY SUPPORT IN THE GAME AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

"As a Mercy main I'm super bummed because GA/AD is the only fun thing left in her kit anymore (I'm not saying she's underpowered, just that Valk is a toothpaste ult and GA/AD is the main reason why I love playing Mercy, that incredible mobility).When this buff goes through for Sombra, it will mean that if the enemy team has a competent Sombra, it's going to make playing Mercy even less rewarding. This is entirely from a player engagement perspective though, so I'm not sure what it's going to do to balance.","

I think 0.65 is too fast.   Especially since hack is stronger now.  On the ptr you are almost guaranteed to get hack off now.  I don’t feel sombra should be entitled to a hack the same way I don’t believe mercy should be entitled to a res.   .70 would be more fair. But to be fair lag on the ptr is terrible which is probably contributing to my hack never being interrupted or me never interrupting hack.  I remember the recent junkrat changes feeling terrible on the ptr but much more fluid on live so maybe that’s what is going on,"

I really like the idea of mystery heroes and having a chance to play them all but right now the only mystery in mystery heroes is how much you will stomp or be stomped. You can go all game without a healer while the other team gets double Moira or the dreaded double Mercy and they are keeping their ults charging while yours gets reset every death.this can result in some incredibly frustrating game play where it seems like the better thing to do is just leave and find another game Perhaps could there be a guarantee of your team having at least 1 tank and 1 healer,"

"I think it'd just be better if they made a 1 hero limit. Currently, if the enemy gets 2 bastions, 2 Torbs, a Rein, and Mercy, there's no real chance of you winning.

"Now that you can't suicide and change heroes, they should make it so you keep your Ult charge as you change heroes.Also, I'd consider 1 hero max too.

"Coming from someone who has over 100 hours in competitive play with Moira.   To start, every team needs (or should have) 2 healers. Simply put, a single healer cannot heal 5 people. When there are 2 healers, each healer is then effectively responsible for healing 2-3 people instead of 5 which is more manageable. Every team needs at least one main healer and while I’ve found it not to be mandatory, a defensive ult is something that is desirable. This means a team composition should consist of either Mercy/Moira/Ana + Zen/Lucio. Most people know by now Ana isn’t a good pick for a multitude of reasons that I won’t get into in this thread. This means you are effectively left with a choice of either Mercy or Moira, one of which has just been nerfed. This explains the high pick rate. Prior to the Mercy nerf, if you picked Moira people would definitely tell you to switch to Mercy. People didn’t want Moira on their team. Isn’t it interesting though that 1 month later without receiving any buffs, she is suddenly “OP”? Here’s why she’s not and the constant struggles she faces in every game:   DVA eats your orbs. Your orbs are about half of your power so a single champion alone reduces your effectiveness by that much just with a single right click. If your fade is on CD and DVA decides to pounce on you rockets-a-blazin, you are dead just like any other squishy in the game. Orisa’s shield blocks your grasp. You need the grasp to recharge your heals as they will run out fast without any recharge. You can’t just go behind the shield to get the charge as you will instantly be deleted. Winston will jump on you and cockblock you with his shield too. He usually won’t kill you if he’s jumping in alone, but he will zone you away from your team who will die without your heals. If other people are jumping in with him to target you, you’re done. Tracer deletes you in 1 clip. If Tracer isn’t deleting you, she is at the very least pre-occupying you so you aren’t healing your team. She will however eventually delete you if your team does not turn around to help. Speaking of flankers, Doomfist will also delete you in 1 hit. While he’s not as common, I’ve had plenty of games where my team could not handle an enemy Doomfist as he wrecks the entire backline. Unfortunately you are helpless against him as he can delete you but you cannot delete him. Speaking of deleting, there’s a ton of other champions who will do the deed. Hanzo will delete you in 1 hit. Widowmaker will delete you in 1 hit. Junkrat will delete you in 2 hits with random spam. Roadhog will delete you with a hook. Pretty much everything in the game will delete you actually. Even a Torb Turret will delete you if you aren’t careful of its position. Your DPS is extremely low. It’s so low that you won’t be able to kill anything that is receiving any type of healing at all. Even then, whatever you target can turn around and kill you before you kill them. She’s a support. She’s not a “duelist.” Any champion that is not in the support category can and will beat her in a fight if she engages. The only thing she’s actually good for is cleaning up low HP targets and adding supplementary damage to assist other people on your team. Your primary role is to provide healing, not be a damage dealer. But there are limitations:You cannot heal a dive comp, especially when they dive on to high ground. The best you can do is throw a healing orb at them which will bounce away into the skybox after the first thing it hits. You cannot heal people spread out. Your healing is 15m range and if you use the only movement ability you have to get closer to heal your teammate, you no longer have an escape and you will die to anything that shoots at you. Your pee is hard to aim. People will try to dodge your pee and waste your meter, even when the enemy team isn't present. Your ultimate doesn’t save anybody from enemy ults. In fact, it makes you even more susceptible yourself as you lose your ability to fade away from danger. Even a simple flashbang + headshot/hammer combo will delete you if you are too close or he is flanking. There are a myriad of other dangers that exist once you hit Q. And of course, Genji will come after you first once he gets dragonblade. You will be deleted if you don't have a Zen on your team to save you. If he's nanobladed, you will be deleted anyway. TL:DR: Moira is a support that can easily be killed by everyone and her upside has limitations as well. She is only popular because there’s only two viable choices for a main healer which your team needs, one of which was nerfed heavily.","

"In case this isn't a joke post, here's why:Placements basically have no effect on your SR. After your 10 games, you will be placed at almost exactly where you ended the previous season, give or take maybe 50 SR. Instead of ""placement matches,"" think of them as ""warm-up"" or ""pre-season"" matches.","

What was your previous season?Don't care about your rank. Play to have fun,"
						Feb 15
					",,,,,,,
"It depends on the placement matches you get matched into, and that depends on your hidden MMR which is from quickplay.So you've been playing quickplay, and the game has a MMR rating for you which is roughly where it thinks your skill level is. This is calculated so it can try to match you into even games when you play.When you do placements for the first time, your MMR is used to determine what level of game you get matched into initially. So having gold medals means you outperformed your team on those stats, but if your team are at 600 SR average then your SR will end up slightly above theirs.That's simplifying it a bit, and there's a fair amount of guesswork involved because I don't think Blizzard has ever officially confirmed it, but generally speaking this seems to be the community consensus.Don't feel bad about your rank though, the first season I ever played on my main account I ranked in Silver, not too much SR away from you. I'm now at 2800 SR. It's possible to climb, just work on getting better. Let's face it, most of the fun of competitive is the process of getting better.","

"you're placed based on personal performance vs everyone else playing those heroes, you're also ranked heavily on your hidden MMR, which may be low. Silvers and golds dont necessarily guarantee you're gonna rank high, gold and silver is just your performance against your team , not against everyone. Also some tanks like Dva its expected you get gold/silver elims. It sucks you got ranked where you did, but you can climb, Ive taken two accounts to plat, one from low gold, one from high silver. Just put in the practice and you'll see improvement!","
						Feb 15
					",,,,,,,
"Placements don't actually affect your rating much, it's just a fine tuning thing.All those games you played and did well in would have been against other people of a similar MMR.For example, I've never played comp until season 7.  But before then, I would occasionally look at the SRs of people in my Recent Players and found that I was often matched with people between 2500 and 3000 SR. Sure enough, once I actually did my first placements ever with 5 wins, 1 draw, 4 losses, I was put as I believe 2736, exactly where I expected to be.","

"Dear Overwatch Team, I know it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see this forum, but I have an Idea about how to solve the issue with lost players in competitive matches. (hang tight, this is a long post)I had just played an Assault competitive match in which my team was soundly defeated (wrecked). However, in the second round of the match, there is always a chance to force the game into a draw. But my teammates must have been pissed about the fact that we didn't even reach the first point (we were attacking first) because, by the time the second round had started, they had all left. I was the last man standing.The opposing team was sympathetic about my misfortune, but they still kicked my butt as I at least attempted to stand my ground. It wasn't until the endgame stats had popped up that it hit me. What if you gave players the choice to jump into a competitive match mid-game?Now I know what you're thinking (hopefully), but I believe it could work (hopefully). I propose, that you add the option to be able to join competitive games. You would give players a preference to either search for a Competitive game, or volunteer as a fill-in for those games that have people leave. To hopefully prevent players who simply jump in to get easy rank points from joining the game, players who volunteer as fill-ins will not be rewarded with Rank Points like a regular competitive game. Instead, they will be rewarded with the competitive points used to get the golden skins for weapons. To make the Idea of being a ""Fill-in"" sweeter, you would give a bit more competitive points than the usual amount when fill-in's help competitors win games.To make sure players don't join the games simply to throw them, every loss results in the player losing half or less the number of Rank points regular competitors lose. But fill-ins will still get at least Some competitive points for volunteering. Basically: If fill-ins win, they get extra Competitive points to spend on their next gold gun.If they lose, then they lose a few their Rank points, but still get a few Competitive points as a reward for volunteering.In order to be a Fill-in, players will have to complete their placement matches and get a Rank.Players who volunteer as a fill-in will usually be placed with games containing competitors of similar rank, except for those times in which similarly ranked games needing fill-ins are non-existent. Now, there are a few exploits in this Idea.Problem: Those pesky smurfs could possibly volunteer as fill-ins, and help lesser-ranked competitors win games. Resulting in a vast amount of competitive points for them, an easy win for fellow teammates, and screwing over the opposing competitors.Possible Solution: you could try an make it more appealing to be at a higher Rank when players fill in by adjusting the number of competitive Points rewarded based on their personal rank and the estimated rank of the games they join. (higher ranked fill-in players joining lower ranked matches earn fewer points; lower ranked players joining higher ranked games earn more points)Problem: Smurfs could party up and join lesser ranked games and proceed to completely annihilate opposing lesser skilled competitors.Possible solution: Deny parties as fill-ins, have the option be solo-queue only....those are the only exploits I can see right now, but come on! I want to say goodbye to lost competitive games due to lost players.Doesn't anyone else?","

"DPS really can't carry either.Widowmaker only has 200 HP. Doesn't matter how good your aim is if the enemy widowmaker has an orisa barrier in front of her and you don't. You're still dead eventually.The difference is DPS heroes are punished more for lacking mechanical skill. Whereas tanks and supports are punished more for lacking game sense and awareness. In a sense a team of 6 can have the exact same mechanical skills, game sense, and awareness, and the DPS will always underperform compared to the other two roles. The DPS have to have outstanding mechanics to match the supports' outstanding awareness and the tanks' outstanding game sense. If the tanks and supports are actually braindead, and the enemy's tanks and supports aren't. That's GG. There are times when I have to swap off DPS and show my teammates how to support. Or swap off support and show my teammates how to tank. Not saying that doesn't happen, tanks and supports can be the problem. But it's much more common to get underperforming DPS than underperforming supports and tanks because of that mechanical difference.","

"02/16/2018 02:34 PMPosted by SquidbarrelCan you carry as Tank - Support or not?yes and no.. The game dosn't really allow for a pure carry role when you are near your correct over all SR/MMR. No mater what your role it's going to be possible for a decent team to shut down that ""carry"" level player with better team work. Unless you're playing on say an alt etc a few tier below your current skill set.So what really passes for a carry with your average player is can you impact the game enough to put your team on the edge of winning? Like no mater how cruddy the team can you by you over all game play get them 90% of the way to a win. Now you might still fail as a team but over time a player with more impact in game will win more games. the tricky part about this for tank and support players, is you will get less shots at huge game turning carry level play than a DPS player will get. It's what makes it a bit harder to get your team to the edge of winning any given game if you're support or tank. Tanks and supports also suffer more when the team comp is cruddy. All of that makes it a bit harder.","

"D.Va's added missiles and reduced Matrix time shifted her playstyle focus away from being a burst damage defender who occasionally hunted down low-health runners or out of position opponents. Now D.Va spends less of her time burst shielding her teammates and herself and instead is more of a front-line space maker who dives in and out the barrier granted by her team's shield tank and bursts down low-health, lone, or poorly positioned opponents much more often.Any D.Va that charges in attempting ""the D.Va combo"" (boosters+missiles+guns+melee) greatly imperils herself should she mess up her timing or her intended target sidesteps the missiles or melee attack since she just blew all her cooldowns minus her measly Defense Matrix and lacks immediate escape. The counter window for her doing this is larger now than was pre-rework. Once D.Va stops by meleeing or ends her booster flight, she must wait 5 seconds before she can boost out. She can shoot back, without the protection of her matrix, or use her matrix without dealing damage, but only for up to 2 seconds. This leaves her open with a 3-second downtime with no abilities whatsoever. Previously, D.Va would charge in and shoot, but if she realized she made a mistake, she had up to 4 seconds of matrix to guard her front with while waiting on her 5-second boosters to be ready again, or a 1-second downtime where she would be easily punished.So again, comparing boost+flee D.Va gameplay: old D.Va had a minimum 1-second vulnerability window. New D.Va has a minimum 3-second vulnerability window. Old D.Va gameplay focused on either a ""follow and assist"" mentality (e.g. diving with Winston) or a ""poke, defend, and flee"" mentality. New D.Va gameplay also works with follow and assist, but ""poking"" now must be played riskier and focuses on boosting in, either making chaos for her team or attempt killing something under 200 hp and preferably away from protection, and then escaping back behind her team's shield. Old D.Va had a harder time securing kills on her own but was played safer. New D.Va can secure kills more easily, but it now comes at a cost of having a greater risk of failing. Old D.Va could use her her Defense Matrix more freely to protect her teammates in more situations. New D.Va's defense Matrix is so short, she mostly uses selfishly it to protect herself. Old D.Va had a hard time as the team's solo tank, but could wing it when played very well. New D.Va needs a barrier granted by another shield tank to play around or she's toast against all but the most uncoordinated opponents. In that sense, new D.Va feels more versatile and powerful, but is more limited in the team compositions she is effective in.","

"How exactly does matchmaking work in Quickplay/Arcade?

I've been in games with bronze players queued against master players. The master/gm players noticeably out skill the rest of the players on both teams. I'm not talking a little, I'm talking a complete stomp.I know quickplay/arcade use different matchmaking but it seems entirely unfair to see a bronze/silver player vs a diamond/masters in the same match. This isn't only one match, I've been looking at the ranks nearly every game to see how/why the matchmaker is doing what its doing.tldr;If you are a master or grand master in comp, how is it possible that they are queued with/against me in quickplay/arcade?

Only custom.  In all other modes the game will try to match you with other players at roughly the same skill level.Note that different modes have different MMRs.  So a GM comp player might be a bronze QP and a platinum DM.,"

"Yes, but like your account stats it takes snapshots periodically to update the PTR account close to your live account, so it will be pretty close to your current hidden MMRs for all game modes.","

"Another event, another time my favourite arcade mode (Elimination 3v3) is gone. I really dislike the ""6v6 No limits"" or ""Mayhem"" (and please don't get me started in ""Mystery Heroes""); it's really tedious and cheese-intensive for me. Barring that the intention behind this move is to make the farming of three loot boxes not so appealing (I doubt it is the case), I don't understand why Arcade can't hold more modes, or all of them.So my suggestion is that, more of a petition: Please allow all the game modes in Arcade, at any time. Put the spotlight on the event exclusive ones like Lúcio-Ball or Capture the Flag Competitive, but don't hide the ones that people enjoy in exchange for others that they outright won't play.We have 35 million players, I'm sure we all know that options that keep everybody happy won't split the playerbase in a substantial way.Thanks in advance.","

"Have Torb buffs center around his capability of aiming his gunshots and you get a buff that does not affect lower level play, if thats what they are so afraid of.

No more Genjis and Tracers 1v2 crushing Torb players in higher rank matches, nothing changes in lower level matches since lower level players can't aim.See?

But for 15 seconds. If you worked together as a team you can easily kill the flag bearer with only 60 heals per second but a sound barrier or trans, even though a shorter time, is harder to penetrate. Moira also puts out a lot of healing on the flag bearer but also damages people chasing the flag bearer. Mercy's ult is currently the weakest support ult in the game overall and if Blizzard keep nerfing her they might as well remove her wings and make her as immobile as Ana, make her ult rez herself but just die again straight on the spot because of how immobile she would be.","

"I haven't been able to find a list of all the heroes and what you can do in response to their ultimate ability so I decided to make a list.  Each ultimate has been broken down by shutdown (flat out stops the ultimate), diminish (doesn't stop the ultimate, but negates at least some aspect of it), and end (stops ultimate once started).  The reason there is shutdown and end is for ultimate abilities that have a ""casting period"" and the ultimate effect itself.  Ultimate abilities without end have no ""casting"" period and happen instantaneously.  Some abilities I'm unsure if they have a tiny ""casting"" period or not, like Bastion's or Tracer's in which they could be hacked, for example.  I know from personal experience Mei's can be interrupted in the time between it leaving her hand and hitting the ground.Status is any loss of control ability (stun, sleep, pin, frozen, hooked) but not control impairing abilities (Junkrat trap, Mei's slow if not frozen, Zarya ultimate).  Hack is separate as there seem to be at least a few instances in which a hack and the listed status effects don't work the same way on someone's ultimate.The other terms used are matrix (D.Va's defense matrix), reflect (Genji ability), invulnerability (Mei Cryo Freeze, Reaper Wraith Form, Zenyatta Transcendence, Moira Fade, Mercy's resurrection target), shield (Reinhardt shield, Winston bubble, Zarya bubble, Mei wall, Orisa shield).  I'm unaware of any ultimate abilities other than Moira's that interact with a Mei wall differently than with a tank shield, save for ones like Genji or Winston which they can simply walk around the wall like any other cover.Unless specifically noted cover negates all offensive ultimates.  Zarya's still pulls through walls and I have died to Pharah's with a floor between us (may have been a bug, not sure).  Also, unless specified otherwise, all damaging abilities are diminished by damage reducing effects (Nano boost, Fortify, Configuration: Tank, and Take a Breather).OFFENSEDoomfist:Shutdown - NoneDiminish - Shields, invulnerability,End - NoneGenji:Shutdown - Eliminate, hackDiminish - StatusEnd - Elimination, hackMcCree:Shutdown - Eliminate, hack, statusDiminish - Shields, invulnerability, reflect, matrixNOTE: Does not appear to take damage reduction into account, or healing received after initial lock on.

"For the first time after reading your post I agree with 100% of what you are saying.Here is my issue, and what I feel is an issue many others are facing.If Blizzard completely guts another support, after gutting every other support save Zenyatta, I will lose people to play with.I am a tank player. We require supports to be effective. If everyone I know, who plays supports, will stop playing Overwatch if Moira gets nerfed, then I am against Moira getting nerfed. I don't care why. I don't care if the pro META is 5 tanks and Moira. I do not want to see 4-5 of my friends stop caring about a game when the devs clearly don't care about them.A Moira nerf will be bad on the game simply because of principle. I do not like it, but that's how it is now. Blizzard has nerfed every support in the game. Zenyatta has been buffed, but his buff was for one instance concerning Widowmaker and body shots on a hero with zero mobility. Beyond that Zenyatta has never been a true top tier support. Always playing second fiddle to Ana, Mercy, and Lucio.I guarantee if Moira is nerfed, deserved or not, the player count will drop dramatically. Blizzard has no one to blame but themselves at this point.","

Lucio feels lackluster and only as a secondary healer. Zen works if you've got good aim. Moira is the only support that feels fun and impactful. Nerfing her would be sending the message that supports are not valued heroes in Blizzard's eyes.

"I wonder how Doomfist would do if he had lower damage and couldn't oneshot but had somewhere around 400 HP, focusing more on disrupting the enemy front line with his CC. In essence a squishier, smaller Primal Winston.With all the knockbacks and knockups built into his kit he'd probably excel at that, and with more than 250 HP he might be able to initiate a fight without being extremely reliant on a Zarya bubble.In his current state he is a 250 HP melee hero with a rather massive hitbox, even bigger than McCree, and the list of his counters is quite long. I believe his biggest problems are also tied to his survivability, and making him an off-tank might solve that issue.On an unrelated note, it's quite ironic how they show him in his cinematic as this towering indestructible monster that can tank 10 full clips from Genji and Tracer, and then he's the complete opposite in-game.","

Just curious as to some thoughts people had for a new hero. Played out as this forum concept may be I believe it's always like to see what you all think this game is lacking. I'd personally like to see long range tank to hopefully coax some people away from dps roles & one tricking. Something that can really crank out dps over a long distance perhaps use deflection as a damage absorption toolkit? I envision some sort of grav defense matrix grenade with an effect similar to orisa shield but duration based. Deflection ensures players cannot cross and walk out like dummies in front without just plain ol' suicide. Same result as walking in front of rein shield but perhaps people might actually stay behind it.,"

Just me saying that it would be cool if the characters who needed love were basically buffed so they could contend with the top characters roughly evenly. Again: Best characters are left alone. The rest are buffed to balance with them. I call it balancing upward. Is that negative to people? The first comment was someone telling me they are glad I am not on the balance team. The next from that person was saying I show favoritism. This place is nuts. I can’t have a single conversation with anyone here. I’m out. Good luck with your bickering.,"

"SombraEMPNo longer blocked by small objects (e.g. sign posts)HackNo longer gains ultimate charge from health pack healingCast time reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.65 secondsNow disables the following abilities:Genji—Cyber-agility (cant doubble jump)Hanzo—Wall Climb Pharah—Hover Jets (if get hacked in air will fall down)Lúcio—Healing Boost and Speed Boost (turns off current song entirely), Wall Ride (can only fire)Mercy—Angelic Descent (will fall from air if hacked even if holding the air same as phara)Machine PistolMachine Pistol spread reduced from 3 to 2.7 OpportunistNow activates when enemies’ health bars are at less than 100%, up from 50% health (sombra vision can now see every target that have lost health.)TranslocatorDuration increased from 15 seconds to 20 secondsDeveloper Comment: The goal of these changes for Sombra is to remove the necessity for her teammates to take damage and heal themselves with her hacked heath packs to try to get her ultimate charged up quickly. Her ultimate will now come up less often, but there are more abilities that are disabled by Hack so it is more effective when used. Previously, Opportunist would only activate when an enemy’s health bar dipped below 50% but now the passive will reveal all damaged enemies which should help Sombra identify targets to pick off. Overall these changes should make her more effective and less reliant on her ultimate.I have earlyer complain that they nerf more then buff, but now it seems like going to right directsion when giveing 5 extra sec on her translocator, that gives sombra time to actully reload and fire some more bullet before escapeing. and that means she can regen more ulti charge, and that will balance the nerf.Also I manage to get into PTR and try her, i cant say that i felt any diffrent with those spread changes, the gun feels the same. but the hack and translocator makes a valid balance for the healthpack nerf.overall i think all those changes on sombra is neither buff or nerf, it's more of a change. she is more usefull in a way and less empbot.if Blizzard plans to change more stuff on her i recomend  them to be minimum changes so she dont end up OP, even tho i would like it since im a sombra main but i think overall the game. never fun with a overpowerd hero.","

The reduction to her spread will do wonders for her and allow her to be more effective at cleaning up kills and actually duelling enemiesHack and EMP being stronger by disabling the abilities shown above as well as Hack being faster and EMP going through signposts are more great changes and will allow Sombra to be more effectiveFinally, the Translocator changes don't seem too big but will easily allow her to be more useful in a fight","

The fact that her healing economy is tied to her ability to actively attack/engage the enemy is a perfect concept for a support hero.

Not just managing her healing economy, but also being sustainable during the mid and late fight makes her extremely fun to play.

They DO have an argument.Most of it is 1) Shes a main healer alongside Mercy and Ana. 1 out of the 3 havent been nerfed while the other 2 is boring to play and the other is UP.2) She has no utility outside of damage and healing to the team. Every other support has utility, Mercy has damage boost mobility, Zen has damage and discord, Lucio has speed boost, Symmetra has turrets and her ult, Ana has grenade (does anti-heal and burst heal) with sleep dart. She has fade for herself and damage/heal orb and spray healing. Thats it.3) She has counters and it is tanks and burst damage heroes.4) 50 DPS, the lowest in the game. Winston is even higher.5) Orbs can be countered by D.va or grouping up or just disengaging from the orb.6) Though her ult charges fast, it doesnt do as much damage as it does but its mostly useful for pushing or sustaining heals for her team for a push.A lot of counter arguments bring do bring up her weakspots, what shes good at and what she isnt. Saying they dont have an argument is saying you dont bother reading or listening to the other side of the argument at all.","

So I was roaming around the forums reading about DPI and Sensitivity other people use and stuff and was rather surprised. I myself use 1600 DPI and 8-9 sens. in game and thought that most people have it. But I keep seeing that people with same DPI use something like 2-5 sens. in game so I decided to check it out since my aim isnt good and I thought maybe low sens will help a little at least. But I just dont get it how people play on such a low sensitivity? I don't really have that much desk space so with sens like 3 or 4 I just cant simply do a proper 360 or even 180 without lifting my mouse. What sensitivity and DPI do you guys use?,"

"Lower sensitivity helps with better tracking. However, you can't just immediately deduct your sens in half and expect results.If you want to reduce it, Do it slowly. My DPI is 800 so i reduce by 0.5 . Yours is 1600 so you can reduce by one. See how it feels. But in the end, it's all preference. People get used to different senses. We got Babybay with 1000 DPI and 9 sens.We got Ryujehong with 1000 DPI and 1.13 Sens. It depends on how you feel. Don't worry about the numbers that much. But if you can't track properly, it's best if you slowly reduce it.","

it has to depend on your mousepad/how much space you have to move around. i used to play on 17.34 sens with a generic mouse with no dpi settings. i believe i have a medium sized mousepad and i now play on 1600 and 3.16 (41 scope) and my aim is way better than it used to be (regardless of what my trash rank tells you i just did placements for the first time in several seasons and havent had time for climbing). when i get good fps i almost always have 70+% accuracy with ana.,"

"If I understand correctly, high DPI/Low sens allows for a much easier window in terms of tracking.  Think of it like moving the mouse 1 inch doing a 180 (higher sense) VS like 45 degrees (lower). In theory, the lower sens player will be able to track targets on screen more consistently ( good for heroes like Zarya or Soldier who have sustained fire). The higher sens will be a bit better for players who are proficient at flick shots (McCree and Widow) because they'll be able to snap over larger distances, assiming their numbers are calibrated so that they won't overshoot on their movements all the time. It also depends on space. I myself don't have room on my desk for a triple-wide mousepad, so arm-aim is out for the most part. I do alright using like 6sens 1600 DPI on a larger-ish mousepad, mostly with wrist movement. My tracking is a bit better, but I can't do snap-180s anymore, so there is a LOT of give and take. I hope at least some of that helps.","

"I made a thread about this earlier today.I recently moved to PC and I've been trying to dial in my sensitivity.From what I've been reading about it, it sounds like the in-game sensitivity is just a modifier for your dpi.  I think in a perfect world you would dial in your dpi to exactly what you want it to be and not have to use the in-game one at all.  But since most mice don't allow you to dial in the exact dpi or maybe you have a cheap walmart mouse, the in-game sensitivity allows you to fine tune it.  The downside would be pixel skipping.I would take this with a grain of salt.  It's just what I've gathered and came up with after googling it all day.I'm currently using 3200 and 1.  It's the same as 800 and 4 but according to this site (https://pyrolistical.github.io/overwatch-dpi-tool/) there would be no pixel skipping at anything above 1080p.  This is kinda what makes me believe that dpi is your primary sensitivity and the in game one is just used to fine tune.","

"1) You get used to it. I used to play at a very high sensitivity and now play at a very low one.2) There's nothing wrong with sometimes having to lift your mouse. You don't need to do 360s either, just 180s and it's fine that being wild to do.3) At as low as 1800 dpi (for Razer mice, 2100 for other) even with the best sensor (3360+) smoothing comes into play, or from what I gather a delay for the motion of your cursor to be smoothed. So you do not want to be exceeding 2000 dpi. I've heard of jitter as well, perhaps they both come together (go figure). Furthermore, recently I've been reading some suggestions that there may be some mouse performance improvement to play at an even lower dpi- 800 being what many fps pros play at, even OW ones. So recently I went down to 800 from 1600 and doubled my in-game sens. That still keeps me on the border for pixel skipping with most heroes but as soon as I go to a higher than 1920x1080 resolution, especially if I go to 4k, pixel skipping will occur. At this point I'm ok with that. Seems most pros and highly ranked streamers don't mind and their performance is good.","

"Hey,I have played with a high sensitivity in the past, but then changed to a much lower sens. Currently, I'm using 1000 DPI and 3.25 ingame sens, and my accuracy has been improved since then easily by 50%~.A friend of mine didn't believe me, he didn't think it could work either. But I told him he should try it at least for a day or two. Now his accuracy has improved dramatically too. Don't get me wrong though. It doesn't mean it's impossible to work with high sens. There are some pro's who use a very high sens, but I don't think it's optimal, at least if you're playing heroes where pixel perfect aim is required.BTW., I didn't just randomly came up with my sens. Instead, I used a method to test which sens would be optimal for tracking. It just happened naturally that I went down A LOT (like 5 times slower than I was before).I used the method of following video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRFWLJazYYo&t=3sIt takes time and it's boring. BUT, I can honestly say that it was really worth it for me. I encourage you to try it out and see for yourself. Maybe you do well with higher sens anyway. But don't rush it, otherwise it won't work.","

"1600 DPI, 6-8 (depending on hero) sensitivity. Higher for Winston or Reinhardt, lower for D.Va or Ana for example.Can't really change my DPI since I play Osu with that DPI and I'm so used to my DPI that it would take quite a while to get used to a different one and.. I've made a good bit of progress even though I've only really played it for 3-4 days, I'm up to 3.5 stars, so that DPI just seems to really work for me.Yes, yes, ""just switch it when you play OW."" I would but my mouse sometimes stays on default settings, sometimes it uses my own, and they're obviously different which.. makes things difficult. The sniper button with my settings is like, 8x the default 400 DPI for example, being 3200 for me.","

"I'm at 1800 DPI and 2.3 sensitivity. I've been lower and I've been much higher, but now any higher feels very weird to me.It has helped my aim significantly since lowering it, but it does take some time to get used to being able to 180. Having a large mousepad and using your whole arm to aim helps.If you want to try it out, get a mousepad the size of the Steelseries QCK+ (It's huge so make sure you have room for it) and download Aim Hero on steam or something. Set the FOV in Aim Hero to 71 (equivalent to 103 in OW) and match your OW sensitivity then start hitting the targets.It won't make you better at OW mechanically (in my opinion), but it is perfect for getting used to a new mouse sensitivity and increasing your general dexterity with a mouse.That said if you are happy with the settings you are using, just stick with them.","

"Set your sens gradually lower, don't make a sudden, steep drop.Play for a few hours with the new one so you'll get adjusted.I went from 15/1600 through 10, 4 and ended up at 3.It's much better this way.","

"I haven't seen the term eDPI, which is basically DPI x Sensitivity. For reference, I used to play at approx. 8000 eDPI (800 dpi, 10 sens), now I play at 4000 eDPI (800 dpi, 5 sens).It all depends on where you feel comfortable. One of the best OW players right now, Ryujehong uses very very low eDPI (roughly 1200 eDPI, I believe), while people like Shadowburn, or other Genji mains often use 6-8000 eDPI. The standard eDPI seems to be around the 4000 mark.I would personally lower your eDPI to around maybe 8000 and see how comfortable you are coming from around 13k eDPI. I wouldn't go higher than 8000 because a) its actually not good for your wrist to only aim using wrist movements, and b) the ultimate goal is motor learning or muscle memory as most people call it. Basically at the end you want to be able to turn every degree of 360° fast without having to think about it or slow down your movement to adjust your aim. And this is proven to be easier to do with whole arm movements with lower eDPI as you use bigger muscles which improves your motor learning.","

Also quad tank would probably kick in even more effective than ever. What I'm trying to say is that if you're a tank or support main Blizzard probably isn't gonna help your situation ever.

If you let yourself get angry or stressed or anxious AT ALL you will FAIL. Being on tilt will always cause you to play worse.If you realize you're on tilt, immediately stop playing. Turn the computer off, get up, go outside. Don't keep playing on tilt because you'll just lose and get more tilted.If you're staying positive and, more importantly, making sure your teammates are staying positive, you will win more games.

"I'm an older gamer, I don't have those high twitch snappy reflexes I used to have. I'm 100% happy there are heroes like Reinhardt, Winston, Moira, and Mercy in the game. I'm happy that I can still compete at a decent rank (Plat) playing these heroes. And you know something. There are a lot of gamers who are getting older and these kind of games (Overwatch) are a godsend to us. We still love gaming, we still have exceptional game sense, and we still enjoy competition, we simply lack those MLG reflexes. Look at the tank roster, those are all amazing heroes that take exceptional game sense in order to take space, secure kills, and defend the  support/backline. The fact that Overwatch had a place for a gamer like me is why I was attracted to it in the first place. This game would not have sold as well as it did if it didn't take into account all demographics of gamers. So before you are ready to toss me aside as a gamer, just know I have booped, peeled, body blocked, hooked, bubbled, DM'd, and shielded all of you DPS and Support players. Know that I have pushed you up with my shields, shot called targets with Winston, Know that I set you up to get that awesome quintuple kill with my Zarya ult/Reinhardt ult. I'll still be there to compliment those great plays you make, but if you don't want to return the favor because you think ""we"" play ""no skill heroes"" that counter your ""skilled"" hero, then I don't know what to say.

"01/26/2018 04:51 PMPosted by RichCI'm an older gamer, I don't have those high twitch snappy reflexes I used to have. I'm 100% happy there are heroes like Reinhardt, Winston, and Mercy in the game. I'm happy that I can still compete at a decent rank (Plat) playing these heroes. And you know something. There are a lot of gamers who are getting older and these kind of games (Overwatch) are a godsend to us. We still love gaming, we still have exceptional game sense, and we still enjoy competition, we simply lack those MLG reflexes. Look at the tank roster, those are all amazing heroes that take exceptional game sense in order to take space, secure kills, and defend the  support/backline. The fact that Overwatch had a place for a gamer like me is why I was attracted to it in the first place. This game would not have sold as well as it did if it didn't take into account all demographics of gamers. So before you are ready to toss me aside as a gamer, just know I have booped, peeled, body blocked, hooked, bubbled, DM'd, and shielded all of you DPS and Support players. Know that I have pushed you up with my shields, shot called targets with Winston, Know that I set you up to get that awesome quintuple kill with my Zarya ult/Reinhardt ult. I'll still be there to compliment those great plays you make, but if you don't want to return the favor because you think ""we"" play ""no skill heroes"" that counter your ""skilled"" hero, then I don't know what to say. No... Check that.. I do know what to say. You disappoint me.This thread is in an unashamed response to this thread:https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760877793Everything i wanted to say but couldn't. thank you.","

You telling me snapping my shield around to juke a RIPTIRE to block it isn't skill? You telling me that baiting out a Reinhardt Earthshatter to block it isn't skill? You telling me that Mercy player with exceptional positioning to follow in behind a dive but zip out and take cover to avoid a widow bullet isn't skill?

Reinhardt is a perfect captain hero role in this game. I support you my brother.

"Edit: Don’t bother commenting if you won’t read the whole way through. My first two paragraphs don’t explain the rest of the paragraphs...Nerf Moira? Nerf Genji? Nerf Tracer? Why would you want those heroes to fall when playing them feels so good? Isn’t that the point. To make great characters? Here’s the thing. D.Va, Winston, Genji(other than the one deflect problem) Moira and Tracer all feel great. Mercy before this last patch was overkill, but she deserves better than what she has. So do the rest of the heroes. Sombra looks like she might be heading towards balance with the heroes mentioned above. I’m excited for that. I have no idea why most of you want awesome characters that you don’t play to take a fall when it would be better for everyone if your own mains were reinforced to maintain a balanced presence. The bickering and moaning is so pointless. Moira is fine. Tracer is fine. D.Va is fine. Someone earlier said Doomfist is OP. I coughed my burritos out of my nostrils. No, Doomfist isn’t, but I hope he ends up where Moira and D.Va are, not the other way around. I hope someone can switch off D.Va one day to play Torbjorn and his team feel it’s okay. I know that’s a bad example because D.Va and Torbjorn fill two different roles, but you get it. Buff more where needed. Nerf less in general. Pray Mercy never unleashes her true power again.","

The word “balance” means they tangle with the other heroes without breaking anything. That’s why we have that word...right? I know that the forum is pretty negative but I assure you I do not favor any hero in particular. I don’t want Moira and D.Va to be more powerful and have higher pick rates. I’m just saying I’d rather have the rest of the cast buffed up to balance out(balance being key)with them than have D.Va and Moira fall. Yes, it’s more time and work, but it’s an overall better decision in the long run, provided it can work out that way.And your insult. It provided nothing to the discussion. It’s just...an insult from some random person on the internet. Like...why?","

Is there any way we can get the color changed to green for allies?

						Feb 9
					",,,,,,,
Also Genji's ally color is green so I think it would fit.,"
							 (Edited)
",,,,,,,
"Notice that Genji's dragonblade has a light blue color to it and has new voice lines for both friendly and hostile i think. the skin itself is cool just like the others, and it really makes you question why the other skins don't have their own special effects as well. You can see a lot of the changes they made to characters and their skins especially in Halloween Terror.This event is honestly a really special one. The skins themself are really good, but so are ones from other events. For this event, they make certain decisions with some skins that you wouldn't see in any other event. I'm sure that the design and the work put in to make these are supposed to compensate for those small extra things.On the other side though:     You know they have made plenty of custom voice lines for skins and some with their own unique sounds. For example, Tracer's Jingle skin makes the sound of bells when blinking, and some puns after a kill like ""I think I heard some ""slay"" bells!""     I can probably name a couple from every event except uprising since that event was more about the characters' backgrounds, not really making them something that they aren't in other events.     Summer Games gave Mercy's Winged Victory a new resurrect voice line,as well as mccree's lifeguard outfit got flashbangs turned into water bottles i think? And soldier had plenty of easter eggs and summer themed items hidden in his Biotic Field, Heavy Pulse Rifle and i think a previous voiceline he had that was for his ultimate: ""Tactical sunglasses activated!""This has existed even before the reappearance of events, but some might have came later in an event sometimes I'm pretty sure. You also have Mercy's Witch skin having the voicelines ""My servants never die!"" and ""I'm on fire! But this witch doesn't burn."" The wings are also changed up a bit to have slightly different coloring and are cut-out a bit...Junkrat's Dr Junkenstein skin one for his riptire....and of course the datamined voice lines that also never hit heroes...Some did come to heroes too, and they got removed afterwise! I think this was shown in Grillmaster: 76's ult and i think the voice line got removed for that... then Zenyatta's Cultist skin which had i believe ""Experience Nothingness."" and he used to say ""Zenyatta is everywhere,"" on a hero change. It got reworked afterwards.It showed up more between the repeated appearances of the Summer Games and Halloween Terror, but after that the small special effects and voice lines kind of died off.I basically expected all those special effects on the Overwatch Anniversary since it was such a special event to everyone, and there were so many skins too!I'll say this: The skins are still amazing, but it really does make me wonder what they're doing with the rest of the time they have on their hands.I'll make an example out of Mercy since I've talked about her a bit: Maybe you can change the yellow light that spawns on resurrecting someone to a red light, with the Chinese symbol of Life attached to it. That would be a start.As mentioned before, the Zarya beam should honestly be green. You can literally see the skins revolve around these certain colors, but they still have the ordinary visual effects in game. You see: You have basically more than 6 skins for all the other events each since anniversary (I think), then you have the epic skins which seem to be discontinued for events. They were in the cosmetic update though, and i'm not gonna count the OWL skins. I like that, but they've been able to launch a whole bunch of legendary skins AND some epic skins some with their own cool effects like Reaper's skin from Winter Wonderland. That probably should have been legendary, and Mei's skin should have been turned to epic if anything.Now I shouldn't expect too much from Blizzard because they've probably been working on other events like Uprising, Anniversary and the previous Cosmetic Update but a little more dedication for this event would be nice just like Hanzo from Winter Wonderland. You even have the victory poses Sombra and Bastion had from the last event that never even made it to the game until after the actual event where they were made for. Then you have it so for every new hero that enters the game, They now need a sitting emote, a dance if they come before anniversary, a laughing emote, and now their own section of sprays, which are small but important things to a hero. Let's not forget The Overwatch League skins they'll need, and after seeing the results of the cosmetics in this new update, I feel like the events are just going to get worse and that trend will continue.Come on, hero balancing and reported players too? I would get upset trying to manage all this and that's probably why i'll be thankful for anything we get at an event at this point.This is just my take on it, and seriously I would enjoy it a lot more if every legendary skin had their own special thing about it like many other basic legendary ones that have been in the game. Some are just super special and come with the effects like Rime and Avalanche Sombra and Bastion had on December. This is unrelated, but since we brought up the topic on cosmetics: Can we all agree that Reaper could feel more awesome to play if his guns started to flow with energy (and it would increase) the more hero damage he dealt for a certain time though? It could also possibly be a decent indicator of how much you're actually getting off with him. Hmm.. a small visual effect that represents Reaper well as a ""Soul Hunter"" I call him and shows just how much you're doing with him.. Kind of like Symmetra's gun a little bit. They also tried representing him and his obsession with death by giving him a new skin from Halloween Terror as Vampire and they actually made it so only his R.I.P. Victory Pose dropped from loot boxes since it describes his character and all the others you had to buy... I want to feel closely related to a hero (not specifically Reaper, just bringing up him as an example) but I don't want to throw away every other hero in the game. I honestly don't know how to feel at this point, I've been at this for way too long.But you (might) start to see a trend in the effort made to an event go down.Edit: Honestly there's no reason events couldn't be better, they're just spending a lot more time doing other stuff like CTF which is probably going to die out with the speed of matches and a competitive mode that is trying to get players on it more often when it is very clear ctf will see very little play time after the event imo. The map currently isn't usable for anything but ctf and you aren't going to be guaranteed it every match after the event. It's weird why Ayutthaya doesn't have a deathmatch mode when some maps give you access to half (or more than half) of them. Same would go for it having an elimination mode. There's a really good chance it'll be added to these modes especially when ctf isn't always around and the new map will clearly gain the least played time without that change.","

I even put up new personal highscore stats for the season I tried so hard to secure the win.The next game our team got steamrolled in 8 minutes and I lost 24SR.I tilted very hard after that.https://i.imgur.com/FqAov7B.jpg - Pic of the game if you don't believe.,"

"Ghost Reload isn't a thing.It's simply filling dead time after the reload goes through with a melee/dash/deflect.Same thing Reaper does with his melee, it takes the SAME amount of time to reload (if not longer) but allows you to put damage down immediately after it.Ghost dash is just a party-trick, it has no use in-game other than saving a few frames and looking cool.","

"As he is right now. His bugs are his biggest obstacle.

"02/14/2018 12:00 PMPosted by Geoff GoodmanThe way we have his leap working right now in our internal builds is that its a double-jump, much like his brother, but with a couple key differences. Firstly, it is mostly a horizontal leap (and its pretty fast), unlike Genji's vertical leap. Secondly, it has a small cooldown, which is necessary considering the amount of mobility it gives Hanzo now. Also, to clarify, you will leap towards the direction you are pressing, not the direction you are facing. This is the exact same control scheme we use for Tracer's blinks, so think of it like that.For his new ability called Volley, we're still iterating on it. For example, we've already changed the numbers of arrows fired from 5 to 6 and lowered the damage per arrow. Currently it lasts up to 6 seconds, and allows you to fire about 3 arrows per second (up to 6 total). Each arrow fires at ""full power"" but deals only 80 damage (instead of his normal 125). There is no charge time while in this mode, if you hold the button down you will fire the arrows in a full-auto mode. This has been really fun so far in playtests. He has a lot more options during combat now, and deciding how and when to use your Lunge ability is really interesting. You can use both ability to leap around a corner and fire a bunch of arrows into a key target, but then you're leaving yourself really open to counter attack. You can also save Lunge when you know there is an enemy Winston looking to jump on you to make a quick leap back while firing tons of arrows into him and his barrier.Both of these changes sound like they are ripped right from Sha Lin (Paladins bow wielder) as he can do a vertical leap (with the main difference being its only backwards and he goes invisible) and can rapid fire 6 arrows within around the same span of 2 seconds. I'm not complaining about these changes as I feel hanzo will be more fun now to play as and against but I just felt as I should just point that out.","

Your tears are delish.As much as I enjoy the tears,  the nerfs didnt really impact him and prevented him to be OP because they didnt touch double jump (other than the wall reset part of it) My aim is not the greatest but its never been an issue with almost every other characters in the game.  Genji and Tracer break the flow of the normal game and force players to need much higher skill at aiming than their counter part genji needs at spamming spacebar.     This is why Genji breaks the game and this is why he will continue to break the game.  His ult is also stupidly strong and the 2 second nerfs may prevent team wipes but it will not prevent his first 2-3 kills of all your squishies and maybe a tank.   Nobody else has such a strong consistent ult...except maybe zarya. So 2 weeks in the patch, people will be back at ruining games with genji in full glory..which may be a good thing because it may finally force blizz to nerf his movement.","

"Most people who hate on Genji are people who can't play high skill ceiling heroes and can't comprehend that the reason they get killed is simply because they were outplayed. And I'm not even crying about the Genji nerfs. Sure, I think they went a little too far with all three at once (I think they should give triple jump back). But I've been playing Genji on the PTR against people between 3500-4000+ MMR , and have a 62% win rating with close to 50 games played with Genji. He is definitely still useful, although certainly weaker than before and requires an adaptation in play style. His ultimate is mostly a tool to force Zenyatta ult, and maybe a couple kills. Team wipes are still possible, but much rarer.","

"My second and last option which i looked into that QP affects it now, before it was just about last comp rating and your performance in placements.Now it looks like it depends on QP mmr even if you played seasons before, for example imagine if you were 3500 last season and now you “tryharded” QP and tried your best only with your main and then played comp, it would throw you in games slightly above your rank. But if you were just messing around and trying new heores in QP it would throw you in games under your SR and that affected your result.In both cases its broken and really needs to be looked at.

"Seen it’s suggested QP helps form your MMR that equally affects competitive MMR and thus SR. Suddenly “It’s just QP” doesn’t sound so fun anymore, knowing you’re causing yourself to be kept with lower tier teammates and never climb, or you’re subjected to everyone else treating it lightly also affecting your chances at winning and in turn, your MMR, especially if filling roles, playing heroes you don’t want to or worse, not allowing the room to play your respective heroes in optimal conditions. Sounds like a damn good time.","

"I've been playing since Season 1, the following are my personal opinions on how competitive has played ever since I started at low/mid gold. Most of this will be pertaining to playing Solo.Solo comp is never a fun feeling. Even if I am winning several games in a row it's more often attributed to the enemy team having a DC, rage quitter, or just all around drama destroying their ability to play. I would honestly say 1 in every 7 or 8 games I get a real match where both teams play legit and aren't yelling at their own team. It feels great when this happens... but doesn't happen as often as Blizzard would like to think. This is what your MOST COMMON match should be like but it simply isn't. When your most commonly seen comp match is angry toxic players ruining a team or when one team has a person burping into the mic and making obnoxious noises while demanding heals, what fun are we having here? Where is the competitive nature here? Why is this the de facto NORMAL game play competitive experience? This is not something any company should be proud of. I truly hope Blizzard understands how intensely mixed bag it feels to play this game in their ""Competitive"" game mode. I feel like I have learned more about how to practice self-restraint and handle talking to children than I have at learning how to play the game at a higher level.TLDRComp in this game is utterly toxic and needs overhauls, things people have been saying since at least season 2 or 3 even. Blizzard has tweaked how SR gains and losses work, how reporting works, but this could be helped further by pushing more drastic changes that have been sorely needed, in my experience with other games.1. Solo queue separated SR from team queue like almost every other game, to include other Blizzard games. Why is OW all grouped up when the playerbase is so big? How does HOTS work fine with that model for example if OW can't try?2. Potentially role based queue so you are rated according to your chosen role.  Top 500 being an account thing and not how good someone is on one chosen hero just feels odd to me since the beginning. Also favors team queue players heavily. Separated solo top 500 players and team top 500 would also work. People like to bash the idea of roles but it would lower toxicity and help chisel to anyone how good you are with your chosen play style. You wouldn't be in a position if you hate to tank or heal for example if you just want to DPS. You wouldn't be in a position to DPS if you like to tank or heal. You will be rated FAIRLY at what you want to play and how good you are at playing it. You will not be forced to play something at your current rank that you know you are not as good at or simply do not want to play.3. Something more done to people who throw games / DC and ruin other team mates SR. They are slowly doing more about toxic players but when people DC or ragequit the entire team you are on are simply screwed over. I don't care how many people suggest this can be manipulated if they make the guy who did it take all the loss, because if someone truly wants to buy accounts just to enable throwing for the team they gonna be spending stupid amounts of money for something so stupid like that. Not to mention time to get up to whoever they play with. I'm sure they can also be reported too, meanwhile, you are not suffering from one persons toxic behaviors / incidental internet problems. Being penalized for some other players actions is mind boggling and I feel bad every time an enemy team loses due to a leaver.4. Golden guns was implemented poorly. I suggest doing something in the future where anyone can earn them from any mode and make Competitive have just special flashy character portraits or something if they must have something unique. The rank flashyness for example when someone looks at your profile pretty much already suffices. Could maybe have a permanent account marker showing your highest attained rank or a spray of some kind. I only bring this up because truly a lot of people do play comp only to place and then never play until season end to do it again. This, or they play a little bit but are inherently angry at how the toxicity works in competitive play which makes the overall game worse because they don't want to play for competitive purposes, they want to play for golden guns. They therefore trigger more easily, hurt people trying to rank up (mostly affecting lower ranking players), or simply aren't trying like others in the team are. Please try to address this by giving what they want more openly to capitalize what competitive players should be expecting in the team mates they are given on any match.5. Decay system. Ever since I got Diamond back in Season 3 I've had just about no desire to play competitive because of this FORCED attitude toward upkeeping your rank and making playing the game a chore rather than something you want to do. Only the top 500 in my opinion should be affected by rank decay, or perhaps just anyone over 4000 rating in general. I lost 166 points when I was in Season 3 as a military deployed member and had absolutely no desire to do anything up until this very season to finally push to Master. Nothing is more demoralizing than losing your rating to nothing, nothing at all. Your time just being thrown out and wasted and unappreciated. My friends mostly left that I group played with due to this, we just didn't want to get together and act like this is a designated raid time from an MMO kind of mentality where we gotta play X and Y days to upkeep it. You basically want us to put life on hold. so again, only the people truly dedicated to getting and obtaining top 500 should be decaying because they should be working to earn, upkeep, and deserve it. Anyone else shouldn't be forced to play at that level of play, in my opinion. Smurfs wouldn't be an issue, as was originally the cause of this decay system, because they would be affected by the top 500 rank decay. Infact, more seems to be needed to ensure people with multiple accounts aren't holding top 500 still to this day, so you know already that this rank decay system isn't working as intended regardless.Thanks if you have read this far, I just wanted to make this post fundamentally different than most players who get excited about ranking up and saying how amazing it felt / what anyone can try to up their game like they may have done to obtain higher rankings. I wanted to instead provide the ENDURANCE it took and PATIENCE through the suffering and misery that is the system instead. I truly love this game but am fundamentally confused why the game is in such a limbo state of affairs when it comes to the overall enjoyment factor and what has been done to make things more fair, less toxic, and more accessible for players.","

I was in a match for example yesterday where 4 of the 6 players were support mains. Is this fair since they have to play outside of their preferred hero class? The enemy team has to be in an equally unfair position for this to be considered ok such as 4 of the 6 players being tank mains so some of them have to also play outside of their norm and preferred position. *I feel like an odd ball TBH that is ok playing any role. This is the way the game was supposed to, in theory, be made for as the devs declare. Switching heroes as they are needed except the majority of the player base does not want to do this. They want to play one specific role generally, let alone 1-2 heroes they specialize in. Competitive play does not support this currently, even though this has been the main numero uno issue to toxicity in my experience the game suffers from. If anyone can recall the game was originally ""designed"" with the mindset of having duplicate heroes like 3 Zarya and 3 Winston on your team which was debunked extremely early as a bad idea for competitive play. I wonder why hero switching is still considered core to this game when it is instead a core toxicity problem.*On the other side of this, I have also seen people fight over ONE hero to play such as a Junkrat, Genji, or a preferred support. So much so that the team will throw if they don't get that one specific hero and say that it's not their fault that they aren't being allowed to play at their best so they don't try. Weird mentalities, but also weird how the game is in a position to not fix this or encourage one tricking / encourage multiple hero picking in any shape or form. The current system is promoted to where you just deal with the drama of what is likely to occur every single match and hopefully your team is adult enough to swallow it.It usually isn't.","

"02/15/2018 01:40 PMPosted by Mizzerellawhat is your reason for only playing 5-6 hours the entire season?Not exactly on point here, but I'm playing to maintain my rating with maybe an extra game or two thrown in when I do. As I mentioned above, being forced to play is inherently unfun in itself when I don't get to choose how I want to spend my time on a game. When the game mode isn't exactly fun and usually a bad experience what else can be expected? I enjoy playing QP mostly, I would like competitive to feel more competitive if I was going to care more about it on a more ""I can't wait to play tomorrow"" mentality like when the game originally launched.Playing in an environment that feels like a daycare half the time is not exciting, competitive, or enjoyable. I do my weekly games in a competitive focused manner, for the required time as enforced by the game, and I then feel relieved until the following week. What a way to promote a game if someone asked me how does competitive mode feel in the game!*EDIT*When I go in game it says I have 9 hours played for the season. I'm sure I'll end up with 10-12 by the end of it. Does it really matter though how much I have played this particular season to iterate my experiences from climbing gold - master? I clearly played a lot back when seasons started and I play much less after becoming Diamond due to decay and the problems that linger within the competitive system leaving it undesirable for me, as documented above.","

They need to have harsher punishment for players who often disconnect and reconnect more than once during the match or who leave matches frequenly. My last three comp matches had leavers who left and did not come back. On my fourth match we had a player on our team who disconnected three times and then re-connected 30 - 45 seconds later. We lost because he was not in the game for half the time.After losing all of those matches I get into a match where we could not capture the first point on a payload map. When it was the enemies turn they captured it in about 15 seconds and our entire team was dead. They did not even need to use any ULT's. The highest Gold elims on our team at the end of the match was about 5 elims and half our team (tanks and dps) had only 1 or 2 elims. It was a totally unfair match and I ended up losing 27 SR even though in the last match we almost won a 5 vs 6 due to a leaver on our team and I had 4 Gold and I only lost 17 SR for that loss.I think this is some BS!,"

This system alone has helped people climb or drop much more than they should. I have personally won 3 or 4 games I can recall because the enemy team gets a leaver. This is not competitive, this is not fair, and the other team is wrongly dropped in rating because of things outside of their own control. You can't say the competitive system treats people fairly and ranks you where you are supposed to be when this occurs much too often still.","

"One thing that has always bothered me greatly about Competitive is the fact that the system is very unfriendly when it comes to losing. Aside from experience, if you lose a Competitive match you get NOTHING. No Competitive Points towards gold weapons and you lose rating. Essentially, losing a competitive match means you've wasted almost half an hour of your time.Now, I know what some people are likely to say...""get good bro."" Okay, but even some of the best players (and no, I am not counting myself among them) can't always carry five dead-weights. Additionally, you cant always control how your teammates are going to play...I've played comp matches where people legitimately throw the game because someone else picked their favorite hero, or because someone picked the ""wrong"" hero. Also count in leavers (intentional or otherwise)--and, of course, simply poor comps or players. A lot can go in to the game that determines whether or not you win that's not always 100% whether one solitary player out of six is a good player.Take World of Warcraft for an example. Yes, a completely different game...but in that game, you are awarded Honor whether you win or lose. Winning certainly gives MUCH more honor than losing, enough to the point where it could mean getting a flashy new piece of gear in a few days or a few weeks, depending on how often you play or win.So, I would recommend that you get at least ONE Competitive Point just for playing. That way a loss, while still negatively impacting your Season Rating, doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.","

"I don't like comp because of how SR works. This game is a team game, however, you have your own personal skill rating to help you match with others of a similar skill rating. Sounds good simply put, but it's quite terrible to be honest. There are way too many variables with SR that pushes the consideration of your actual skill to the back lines. Your SR is based mostly around you winning or a losing a comp, with either random teammates or your friends. If you're doing well, but your teammates aren't and cause you to lose, you get punished for that, and vice versa. I think SR really needs to be based around solo performance, at least in solo queue. Now I'm not saying solo performance should account for all of it, but it needs to be somewhat of a factor with winning or losing still playing a major factor into how much sr you get. Imo, this would eradicate boosted players from a skill rating, and your teammates would be more evenly matched (minus smrufs unfortunately).","

I have started recording my games recently because I was getting a thrower/troll every game.I might make a Youtube series on all the crap in comp.

"So many good points already made. With all the gripes, frankly we just want the game to improve. The experience is so inconsistent right now.Man, solo in this game just isn't fun though. I've tried to have fun with it, but too many times I just ask myself: is this fun, what's the point?OP's First point is pretty key, it hurts, cross-matching groups and solo was never a fun experience. So many times that maybe it could work, it just ends in frustration. Lack of roles is pretty much why I don't like playing OW anymore. I can't play what I want, I don't have fun being forced one way or another because of what either my teammates or an enemy is playing. It's decidedly anti-solo. The system that seemed so interesting at first reveal, that the game completely depends on (hero-swapping), turns out it's something I can't stand. I didn't realize at the outset I was the kind of person who only wanted to play one way. Turns you OW definitely helped me learn that. Too bad I still never played the character I liked in Comp, it was never the right pick after all. In fact it's that system that keeps making me think that even a free to play game like World of Tanks would be more fulfilling. You select what you want to play, then are placed in the match. And yes, stats end up being tracked per thing played, as well as overall, leading to better personal improvement when you can see what types of things you do better/worse in. Sometimes I wish OW was World of Overwatch. Then shurg and think time to go to an FPS for old people.What's crazy is that I generally like team based shooters, but only when they've got setups that allow solo players some flexibility in how they affect the match. So much of OW comp is tied up in being Seal Team 6 with 30 seconds of time to get to know one another, that being the kind of person that would do better with chat and voice turned off completely doesn't matter. I think I could go on for hours. Mostly because there's such a great game in Overwatch, but man, Comp destroyed my ability to enjoy the game. Especially when I could just go and play some tank shooter with accurate stat tracking, queueing for the role you are good at, the ability to influence matches with strategy, Chat Off not affecting your play, and a MMR in standard modes, while still being ""good"" in those modes additional does translate well into the more competative/strict ones. Never expected to be spoiled by how well done certain aspects of other FPS games are done, and wishing OW would overhaul a bit.Because I'm done with comp. Last time I seriously played I rose hundreds of points and gained two ranks. Didn't feel like I was anything more than lucky. And I'd group-queued. If a bunch of people at the same rank can spend a couple days grouped together and all rise a couple ranks because now they are winning by playing against mixed and soloist groups, the system has some explaining to do.Game doesn't have many incentives to play more than required to keep up rating once you get to a #### you're comfortable with. After all, the game doesn't offer much achievement/progress outside of collecting shinys and raising your comp ####, and the rate at which that #### can fluctuate in a day is insane. It's tough to take it as practice when you're a solo player with a single account and a day of ""practice"" could end up a losing streak you don't seem to recover from. The system doesn't incentvize playing a huge quantity. Shame.","

I would love a solo queue/role queue. This doesn’t force meta at all. It shows you will have an even 2-2-2 and it does not lock you to a role but you have people who have the ability to make a proper comp.I love to tank. And backup heal as zen. But if I get 4 dps I’m gonna struggle with should I stick with a tank or a healer? Because at that point I feel I am not gonna be able to do either effectively since covering for 4 dps and a lone healer seldom works out well in my elo.,"

Because at that point I feel I am not gonna be able to do either effectively since covering for 4 dps and a lone healer seldom works out well in my elo.From my experience, if role based queue had to be forced as 2-2-2, it would still indeed be better than what we get right now playing solo. At least you go in knowing what to expect and that your team is ready to play as those roles. Team queuing could easily still stay as the game is currently and people just pick whatever because the game is centered around rating you as a team which makes roles not required. If you play with someone or an entire group of someones then I'm assuming you know what people can play / what people can switch to if things are getting rough.It's just a shame this game considers the most popular way to play this game as not as important as 100% supporting the premades, solo players will always be more numerous in almost any game you play, especially for shooters. It's just weird, maybe an oversight on their part similar to the original idea of having duplicate heroes on the team being ok and balanced.02/16/2018 08:37 AMPosted by PlayerTfw you think rank in a game allows you to comment on the validity of statistical systems.You clearly didn't read the post. I decided to give an overview experience of the climb / day to day game feeling vs. telling people how to rise higher in the ranks and how great of a feeling it was to finally be at X. Most people who get Diamond and above want to say how anyone can get to where they are by just doing X, Y, and Z. I wanted to give the reality check of what the overall feel is for the common solo player that I see time and time again in my matches. I wanted to convey how frustratingly silly your SR is dictated by luck and not your own skill in a good chunk of your matches, too big of a chunk in your matches even. If I get to Master this season I get there knowing I won at least 6 matches so far because the enemy team had a leaver, that I had to be good and flex when the general group players cannot or will not. I'm not in any shape or form gloating how ""good"" I am.Thanks for stopping by.","

I agree with you it feels like it favors some aspects of the game. My overall consensus of the game is that it does not feel like they are adding enough to the game or keeping up with the growth of the community. I feel that if you had more game mode options that were not rotating in the arcade but stand alone like qp; you would see more balance in the community. I see teams getting flamed for going “try hard” in quick play. So already a large majority think if you don’t go there to mess around then you’re playing that game mode wrong. I get that game has a lot more leniency in mistakes vs consequence because you don’t have an enemy team playing their mains all the time. But now you lack a place to be able to learn because I like playing against the try hards because they give me a situation I need to find a good hero choice for. We have to face it the game needs a lot and the devs probably don’t know where to start. But a better alternative to how comp is now would be the better choice I feel.,"

"02/15/2018 01:24 PMPosted by KrytonDoes anyone have stories they can share with competitive play? I would be interested to hear how other people feel about the general game to game experience others have had since the incarnation of this mode.Sure. I don't feel the competitive system is perfect, but I'm pretty happy with it overall. I'm Master rank, for reference.There's a lot of variety in how games go. Occasionally there is some toxicity in chat, but almost never before the team is demoralized or losing, and even then at my rank most people will try hard to win until the very end. Some games people are pretty focused, and you have constant call-outs on targets or ability cooldowns. Some games people will suggest particular strategies, like quad-tank, or have a specific plan of attack to deal with a problem. I've personally formed a plan for Numbani A based on walking a deathball onto point, pointing Reinhardt at their hitscan, and relying on Reaper to murder anyone jumping down to contest; it worked very well because we caught a McCree with his pants down on point, and despite the outcome being fairly lucky people were quick with praise for the plan after the quick victory there.There's often excitement in comms when someone lands a big ultimate or kill. Some games there's a lot of humor in general; a couple people are chatty or witty. I've been trying to save a nearly dead Reinhardt from Genji and he shrieks that Naruto is going to kill him. There might be much chuckling over someone on either team making a boneheaded mistake. Sometimes people are just having a good time, and if someone is popping off there's often praise for them saving the day.On the negative end you get comms regarding disappointment. Often ""oh no"" if Widow picks someone, or ""we wasted ultimates there"". At Master rank this sometimes shifts into tactical discussion like an analysis of what ultimates remain on either side, or calls for retreat. Sometimes chatter will be along the lines of ""widowmaker is wrecking us"" or ""soldier is uncontested on high ground"" and then discussion of who can deal with the problem, whether it is changing characters or just changing strategies. And yes, sometimes people get very demoralized and seek to lay blame or moan about it in chat. After a loss there's sometimes insults thrown about people being uncarryable or a thrower.On the personal gameplay side of things, there's still a ton of variety there as well.As Zenyatta sometimes I feel like I'm outputting lots of damage, but we still lose key fights or I stop popping off eventually and we lose, though certainly sometimes we just win and I feel like I did a lot. Sometimes I feel like I'm superfluous or not having a big impact, that I die very quickly to flankers but we still win fights. Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing much, but teammates later praise the orb placements or my main contribution was surviving a Tracer's attention all game. Sometimes I kick myself for not saving Transcendence, and sometimes I just save the day with it. Some games I feel like I'm getting absolutely wrecked by a Genji or D.Va, and chide myself for letting them kill me so easily, while others I spend the whole game stomping on a Tracer and feeling good.As Zarya it's more feast or famine. Sometimes I can play aggressive with a Reinhardt and just roll over the enemy team. Sometimes I get disintegrated over and over and try consider if I need to swap or if I'm doing something wrong. Some games it seems to go well but all the squishies behind me keep dying. Lower near Diamond I found I could easily bully opposing teams with charged up Zarya, but later on it's more common that there's no spam character and I find I just can't get energy.Overall I rarely feel like the game was hopeless from the get-go. Some games are hard-fought, going to 2 or maybe even 3 rotations through attack/defense. Some games we just lose and lose each fight, but afterwards I ask myself what was going wrong, and I can almost always identify a different approach I could have taken that might have worked better. Sometimes it's a pretty painlesss win; we take an early lead and never let go of it.But perhaps more importantly, I have fun. It's a fun game. Sometimes I have fun because I'm winning. Sometimes I have fun because I'm personally performing well, or winning some satisfying duels. Sometimes I have fun because the comms are very positive or humorous; those are often the best games for me. Sure losing can suck, and some games really are demoralizing even for me, but the good far outweighs the bad in my opinion. Ignore toxicity, and there's always the next game; on the whole the other players are fun to play with.","

"I kind of wish Blizzard used all their hidden stats more. Like if I get a team that has historically an 8% win rate because it is various heroes not mixing well, then it would be nice if it didn't take so much of my SR on the loss. Because it was very expected with the people I was handed.If I get a nice team composition that has like 80% win rate, I'd honestly not mind losing and losing SR because then we deserved it for being worse than the other team. But as the game works, with a good team composition you almost always win.","

"[edit : I loved reading your post, Arzoo. Thanks for taking time to share]I think the soloQ problem lies on ""bell"" matchmaking. I'll try to explain myself :How OW's matchmaker creates its data :* Overall playerbase, from worst to best* The worst players, as well as the best players, are much rarer than the average player. Put the best player at the lowest rank, he will not stay long. And vive versa. Climbing from below is very simple, Fall from above just as common (decay).* The majority of players are therefore ""in the middle"" (high silver, gold, low plat), with less players as we go either to worst, either to best. (i.e : a bell)Consequences of a majority being in the middle:* As differentiation of personal skill becomes much more vague (because quantity), the same SR can be : an excellent player but had no luck on his previous teammates picks (bad teamplay), or a rather average player who won the MM lottery (mates who pick the right guy, play team > good teamplay). This problem happens less above a certain rank, as a majority already knows how to flex, communicate in voicechat, and globally have better skills. From mid diamond and above, a victory will be decided mainly on the teamwork, and less jeopardized by picks, or skill.* Since everyone is not exactly same SR at team composition, matchmaker tries to avoid the drama of putting you against too stronger players by distributing all 12 players, and will be satisfied when it gets an average between all SRs. Ex : If a 2800 SR gamer is paired with a 2600, it will find a mirror 2800-2600 on the opponent team and put you, 2650, into the match. Matchmaker then assumes both teams are balanced, except they're not ... If the 2800 SR finds the opportunity to jump on you, you have high chances to be screwed. According to matchmaker your team's 2800 SR guy should be able to jump on opponent's 2600 and balance it all ... except it's absolutely not guaranteed. Opponent 2600 could hide behind a shield, stay at distance, be protected by an ult, etc. This mechanic is used in all ranks, but as the ""diamond and above"" SR win/loss is static, these higher tiers fluctuate less, and SR gaps are way more important in the middle.* the matchmaker will also make the decision not to make you queue for more than 3 minutes. If for example he did not find 6 players at 2400, he will put one at 2300, and one at 2500.* Finally, to avoid wasting too much time, the MM does not try to absolutely find roles that suit yours, that is to say the one you prefer. That's why we can often end up with 5 main dps, or 5 main tanks. Once again excellent flex players who master all the roles will be more ""above"" than in the middle.* Now pick up these 4 big principles* shake it all* cook for 20 minutes over low heat* put some salt* and that's the big mess we all know as silver, gold, plat, low diam. (or should I say .. the lottery)Add to that, ""tilting"" : if we are too low, we smash everything, easily imagining ourselves in higher ranks. Once at our season high we say ""wow I did it"", focus on higher, until we get a bad matchmaking (a dps main that ends up having to heal, a heal main that must dps, etc, or just a strong opponent). Then we fall back in the middle, from where it is much longer to get out. We think it's not deserved because we have already been higher, tilting ensues, fatigue ensues, catching up to where we think we belong becomes an horrible experience.The competitve environment is a set of interrelated problems that create new ones on their own. The solution is not simple and would require several adjustments, that can also have interrelated consequences. But hey, I guess Blizz is working on it (I hope)._________________About the ol' saying : ""just be good"". Well yes and ... no :)- Yes: if we pick heroes that do not really need teamwork (typically, some dps). A Tracer for example will not wait for a shield to charge a healer, or a healing orb for recall. But ...- ... no, when ""being good"" means more oriented towards strategy, team synergy, so typically support and tank (except roadhog of course). Because precisely many are fed up with believing in good matchmaking, many decide to focus on being strictly dps (some even strictly one hero). Except Overwatch implicit rules are clear : tanks are vital, healers aswell, and each role needs the other. Classic example : a 3rd dps painfully agreeing to fill the 2nd heal. Picks Zen. Focuses on shooting. Tank gets rekt, he gets rekt. Returns to dps. Loss streak.TL;DR : for most people, bronze/silver is easy to get out of, diamond/master is comfortable to stay in, everything else is a rollercoaster of interrelated problems.","

Where Hanzo can just outwait your wraithform to Headshot you at rapid speed Instead of you baiting out scatter and moving in for the easier kill.

Please note that there will be loopholes as there is with casinos but this will limit the ""freedom"" games has at the moment. I suggest you all read it.What are your thoughts? Do you want regulation on lootboxes?According to the article (can't get reddit to open on phone), these are the laws that are incoming:1. Games that have microtransactions can only be sold to those over 21 years of age. 2. They must mention that they have gambling in the rating content of the game. 3. The publishers must publish the drop rates for items. Apparently there's a 4th. May have missed this. So let's go down the list:1. Overwatch has 30 million copies sold in 2 years. They aren't getting those copies taken off players. That just means newer versions of the game will be harder to buy in store. But anyone with a PSN, X-Box Live, or you know, a PC can just buy a digital copy. Because you can just lie about your age. So this law just hurts future, physical sales, and nothing more.2. This does nothing. At all. People who are old enough to buy these games themselves don't look at the warning label. Parents who are buying a game for their child who is under 21 (and let that sink in that you still need parental consent to buy a game at age 20) already don't care about the rating, otherwise they wouldn't be buying it. 3. Blizzard has already published these. Twice. For 2 different countries. They do it again. *shrugs*4. ??? Ultimately these laws just affect future sales of physical versions of games. Doesn't affect Overwatch. None of them ban microtransactions outright, just restrict the sales of physical versions. All I expect to happen is a spike in digital sales, and they aren't going to police that. So what you end up getting is a hurt in retail stores, which escalates to them being non-profitable because they aren't selling enough copies. Big business like Target or Wallmart or BestBuy make up for their loses elsewhere, or they just see them as unprofitable and drop them all together. But non-chain, mum-and-pop stores go out of business because they don't have anywhere else to make up their lose of sales because now they can only sell a huge portion of their games to a fraction of the market. So... Cool for Hawaii.","

"If i were you i wouldnt want anyone to touch OW-s lootboxes because anything that can happen will negatively impact everyone. Lets summarize shall we:-If anyone under 21 cannot buy boxes,it means they have to make up for the loss of income, lootboxes will be expensive.-When that is coming,they HAVE to make lootboxes more rewarding,because no one is gonna buy more expensive lootboxes for the current droprate.-This leads to the already existing ""Golden Lootbox"" and the idea behind it.-Bought lootboxes will have increased chance of getting epic or Legendary items, OR always guarantee at least 1 item you dont already have. While normal earnable lootboxes remain the same.I dont even need to explain how that will impact the ones who dont spend money.The second option is that they remove lootbox entirely from the shop(which is unlikely) and you can only buy currency.Which can end up being too expensive for low currency,or extremely profitable,making ingame lootbox and currency income from them obsolete.I believe,Blizzard already adapted in China to lootbox regulation in a genius way,which is:You can only buy currency (VERY LOW amount,like 15-30-50 etc) BUT you get lootboxes for free for your purchase,according to how much currency you bought. This means technically,you didnt pay for lootboxes,hence not gambling,while the economy remains the same.","

Not like you get free samples waved in your face all the time to keep ya buying or anything.Not like people have gambling addictions more than people have alcohol addictions.It's not like kids are developing these behaviors as early as 13, the behaviors of spending money on a random chance with no real world value or benefit.Well MTG and YuGiOh are random packs. Well you can buy any card you want in specific and not from some devalued not real currency. They also retain a real world value, trading value and lets say a ban happened on a player? You still have your assets. Sold a foil cavern of souls for $125 couple months ago. A friend sold 4 revised dual lands that he paid $15 a piece for in the 90's and payed his rent. (I am sure a lot of you understand the blessing of basically getting an extra pay cheque on a hard month.) What do you get from loot boxes these days in terms of value? To see a weapon skin? Trade value? Actual worth? It's just spending money on something that can never benefit you...","

We have several mom-and-pop video game stores in the Baltimore area, and that is precisely what they do.Why? Because they're not going to compete on newer titles with Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target, who are already selling copies of those games to people who likely also came into the store for purchases not even video game related.They can't compete with Steam and digital sales. Hell, GameStop can't even do that.Their bread and butter is the retro-games, which are physical sales only. No digital downloads back then.","

Thing is, digital content is much more problematic for many more reasons.  Unlike card games which you can either buy card packs to hope to open what you want, you can buy those cards from vendors, online stores and many other places without having to risk gambling to get what you want. Card games such as Magic also hold secondary market value so even if you don't get the card you want, cards still hold a monetary value both big and small and can still be traded or used for various other things. Digital content is stuck being just that; a digital non-physical product that you're buying so you're essentially spending money on nothing and while games like Overwatch don't have ""pay to win"" mechanics through lootboxes, many other games do so this isn't specifically targeting Overwatch but they still will be affected by it. Lastly, gambling is much more dangerous when a parent's credit card is tied to a game console that their child also plays. A kid can simply charge however much they want and get all the lootboxes they desire while trading cards require the child to physically go to a shop or location and have the parent's credit card to purchase said trading cards. Still possible but a lot less likely. So in short, the whole ""Whatabout""isms for trading and collecting cards is a moot point to argue. Their regulations have existed for years and their ""gambler's addiction"" is far less likely and much more preventable than simply pressing the ""buy"" button on the lootbox page.","

(Aka you end up paying less in the end)Legendaries have 2 things going for them from what I can gather.1. Random chance, as with everything, random chance you will get a Legendary.2. Pity timer - this timer is not effected by random chance drops (at least I don't think so) and after so many boxes you SHOULD be garenteed a legendary drop, once it drops, this timer resets and waits for the same number again before dropping another legendary.Combining this will explain why sometimes you get 2 legendaries in the same box. Or how you can get 2 back to back or very close to each other.Buying stuff will not make your random drop chance go up, and obviously doesn't effect your pity timer. As stated above however, you will get more dupes, which means more gold, which is a good thing given the fact the random chance and pity timer both do not garentee said legendary will be an event one.","

"I don't think it will work out how you think it will.PBSR is what makes climbing possible despite bad teammates.  For the longest time people hated losing SR despite having a good game but with terrible teammates and losing.  I remember countless threads about how personal performance should affect SR.Then they told us that personal performance does in fact make small difference in SR gained/lost.  After learning that and the rise of ""one tricking"" the general opinion of the community changed and ""we"" decided that PBSR was a bad thing.PBSR has both good things and bad things associated with it but to be honest I don't feel any of the positive effects of removing it.  It just feels more frustrating to climb. I'm still getting one tricks and I feel like all of them are Sym.Resetting MMR isn't going to make anything better.  Everyone lumped into the same pool isn't going to be very fun.  Due to the varying range of skill, matches are going to be very lopsided and everyone will more than likely place way lower than they were.  Eventually the system will sort everyone out and we will all be more or less the rank we are right now.  So essentially it will do absolutely nothing except make comp miserable for a few months.","

"Because people like to win. The game has been out long enough that some of us have tried all the various wonky team compositions, and we know that some heroes just don't work well. Especially when they're played on maps that don't suit them, or in situations that don't give them any benefits for the team.You call them meta slaves, but really it's just called experience.","

"Meta: Strategy, heroes, or team composition that gives you the best chance to win in the current patch.Competitive: A game mode where you should primarily aim to win.Offmeta: Heroes that are weak (for a good reason) in the current patch.Example: If hitscan heroes didn't exist and you play Pharah, you'd probably do great and she would be really strong, but you gotta adapt when they introduce hitscan heroes and they keep shooting you out of the sky and you're unable to do anything instead of calling others meta slaves.","

I'm better off having fun. I view the SR/Matchmaking system a bit differently than a lot of folks. Most want to climb. I just use it as a tool for getting more balanced matches. As long as my performance and tactics are consistent, I'll get to a point where I can have good matches without following any ""meta"". I just patiently play the game and wait for the system to adjust me there. Much more fun than stressing out.","

Then here's some truth for you that you will love to hear.In competitive:Your Reaper accuracy is bottom 4% of the PC playerbase.Your Tracer accuracy is bottom 1%.You have 3% weapon accuracy on Mercy, also bottom 1%.You deal a whopping 600 damage per minute on Reaper, which is bottom 2%.In Quickplay:Your average KD ratio is 1.24 - bottom 6% of the PC playerbase.Your average eliminations per minute is 1.21 - meaning you die basically every minute.Over 22 hours on Hanzo, you deal an average of 570 damage per minute, which means that you land ~4.5 arrows per minute to the body.If you're landing one Hanzo arrow every 13 seconds, I don't think you have any room to tell people the optimal settings to play OW at. Based on the pathetics stats you show in both QP and Competitive, your FPS clearly isn't ""smooth"" otherwise you would be at least below average instead of literally bottom of the barrel.","

"Thank you, for absolutely shafting us with the new standardised start times for the weekday OWL matches.Beforehand, most people in Europe would have to stay up until roughly 1am to see the end of the first match of the day. Late, but doable for a lot of people. But now, we'd have to stay up until roughly 3am just to catch the conclusion of the first match of the day! I don't know how the organisers think it works here, but, we do actually have jobs to go to and classes to attend etc. Maybe start the games at 12pm PT and have longer breaks in between games? The format at the moment is an absolute marathon session for all viewers and casters etc. I don't think I'm alone in saying 6 or so straight hours of OWL burns you out pretty quickly.Had to post this in here because, for some reason much like there's no EU Gear store, there's no dedicated forum for OWL.","

The Chang to time is to help them as they should be blizzard first priority when it comes to owlThem changing those times has nothing to do with the fact London had to play 3 games on the last day. They've remedied that by moving the Stage playoffs to a Sunday instead of having them on the final Saturday alongside 3 other matches.As for teams having a short gap between some matches (a late finish and early start) that happens very rarely and usually only between Friday Night/Saturday afternoon matches. The start times for Saturday afternoon matches are still much earlier than other days so the time to rest and practice in between matches still isn't great. But I see your point,"

"Idea I wrote after watching this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CknHni1xOnAHanzo should have a burst arrow. Basically, when you hit a barrier a cone of explosion damage will come out on the other side. Kinda like those artillery shells that are made to burst out the other side of a wall. The cone's burst would be fairly narrow so aiming is still involved, but it will burst a fair ways back to catch those further away. I think at max it should do 75 damage to those closest to the blast and taper down slowly from there, then stop at a range. The damage is to catch out those low health enemies hiding behind the barrier. I feel sorry for the Reinhardts here but the damage wouldn't be too bad for them. The cool down would be relative to other arrows. Kinda sucks you could only use it on barriers but if it went to through thin walls that could be OP, even if there was ""drilling time"" before it burst. (And hard to implement i would guess) So I'll say no to drilling.Though it would make sonic arrow even more useful and fun. -The more I think of it this could also replace or enhance scatter arrow; burst on other side of barriers, scatter on walls and floors. (or possibly change the scatter to an explosion to make it feel more consistent, if that's necessary)Any constructive comments?","

This isn't a game that was designed, played, and then became an esport. It's clear that they had esports in mind beforehand and worked towards making them happen.The International is successful because the fans want to see it happen, and they are the ones that significantly provide the prize money (myself included). When you push a game as an esport rather than as a game and let it evolve into an esport, you miss the mark and alienate the more casual players I feel.","

It sounds like you watched Contenders, which was honestly a very dull, one-sided tournament by anyone's standards because most of the teams were not Tier 1 so EnvyUs just crushed them all. OWL will be much, much more even, and if the preseason is any indication, there will be much more diversity in comps. During the preseason, the only hero that didn't get play time was Symmetra, which means that even the likes of Hanzo and Torbjorn got picked a few times. As far as personalities, once you get to know the casters and players, you can get really invested in them. Everyone has their preferences, but I truly think all the casters do a great job and make the games even more entertaining, and there are multiple popular streamers in the league, so that gives you some familiar faces to follow. I get it's not for everybody and I don't want to shove it down your throat, but you might be pleasantly surprised if you give OWL a try. :)","

"When this genre kicked off back in Quake almost 20 years ago, it was built on a simple premise. You got good, joined a clan, your clan joined a league, and you would compete, not for a personal rank.. but for the reputation of the clan.It was great. Most players, probably 80-90%, were in clans competing in leagues, and the vast majority of those communities got the full blown OWL (as Blizzard has branded it) experience. It wasn't just for a few people, it was for everyone.I was waiting for Blizzard to take this natural next step with Overwatch, but where is it? All I see is a company (who's games I generally enjoy) take something that used to be enjoyed by everyone, and make it something uniquely the right of a handful of top players, arguably 0.0001% of the player base. Why?What season is this, Eight? How many people play this game, 30, 40, 50 million? Why in isn't a there a clan system yet? Why are there no leagues?This was something a community 20 years ago figured out with no help from a developer. Here we have an opportunity to take the memories of some of the best competitive matches people had in TF and share that with tens of millions of people in this game. But what does Blizzard do?Sorry guys, this isn't for you, it's only for the 0.0001% of players good enough to get into our ""cool kids club"". The rest of you are just going to have to enjoy the NOT AT ALL TOXIC, clan-less, self defeating, personal performance obsessed joke of a competitive system, BUT HEY, you can watch your favorite top teams have all the fun in an actual, functioning, competitive league like all your older counterparts did in games for years! FUN HUH!I get that Blizzard is taking advantage of the younger crowd's ignorance, not knowing that this was a standard in team shooters for decades, but to spin this and turn it into a money making machine, while withholding it from the rest of your base, it's pretty.People can like OWL, that's fine, but there's no excuse, no reason why you would start this clan/league structure from the top, and simply end it at the top.. It should have honestly started at the bottom, then and only then, the end result AFTER a successful and popular competitive system, do you capitalize on that and create OWL.You should all be asking why the  a game like this, this popular, with this much developer attention, still doesn't have a clan system or leagues yet.http://qwtf.digitaljedi.com/^ Why doesn't this exist. Could give 2 about OWL honestly. I want the game I paid for to have ""at least"" what free mods had 20 years ago.

"As an ""older"" game, I remember my Quake days and fully agree with the OP. Competitive play should be started in a grassroots environment with clans / guilds.Not only should there be clans in OW since the beginning, but there should be various leagues to play in, not just the OWL which less than 0.001% of players participate in. Every sport has both a minor/B- league, and additional amateur leagues that are more local.Building competitive OW from the ground up, instead of top-down, should have been the approach by Blizzard. As a console player, who also finds the Dive meta stale and boring now, I have little to no interest in the OWL. The matches just have the same 9-10 heroes in every game playing in the same style.Why, after almost 2 years of this game being released, we don't have a flexibile, robust clan system already? Why, as a team-based shooter, wasn't some kind of a clan/guild system a priority since day 1 of development?","

A simple anecdote. However, lets look at that one more closely shall we?500 hp with armor, but all he can do is walk around slowly, swinging his hammer at all that ranged dps classes who melt him from a mile away while he struggles to find some cover. Compared to the small profile of Lucio who can duck and hide behind anything he finds, all while at least being able to shoot back....But okay you want a closer a comparison. Ana gets hacked, no more self heal, and she has to try and take pot shots at her slowly with her biotic rifle. Just as squishy as Lucio, no survivability options, and no changes to her from before. So all they've done here is leveled the playing field. Sorry if I don't feel bad for poor old Lucio.","

I don't think Tracer is going anywhere and Genji is not even close to being a staple in meta comps so Sombra could easily be played together with Tracer.

"She certainly needs something. The devs changed her extensively and repeatedly for months, got tired, left her in a spot that the Mercy player base doesn't like from a play experience point of view, and moved on to other heroes. I wish they had done things differently. I wish they were more willing to step back and reassess their view of Mercy based on first principles. But things are the way they are, and we're stuck in the spot we're stuck in. Hopefully they'll come back to her in the future. When they do, I hope they'll be attentive to the spirit of the feedback from the Mercy community and willing to approach Mercy with a more open mind and with the courage to change what needs to be changed. The essence of the feedback is that Valkyrie is not nearly as engaging/fun/dynamic/impactful an ult as they envisioned it to be, and it's not loved by Mercy players nearly as much as resurrection was. If you change the most iconic aspect of the character so drastically, you should replace it with something else that the player base feels as strongly about. I like some of the revert variants, but I don't think that's the only way or even the best way to go from here (and I'm pretty sure the devs are strongly set against revert). I'm happy to keep an open mind about future Mercy directions, as long as the devs realize that something is wrong with where they left her now. Some careful thought, some time, some  listening, and some courage need to be put into this.","

"Two things - either the team isn't getting picks so the Moira's trying to take things into her own hands, or the Moira doesn't understand her character very well. Either way, most of the time it can be fixed with a simple polite conversation over chat to figure out what the core problem is.That being said - a lot more people want to play DPS/Tanks over supports. If you really want to make a difference, practice up on your supports until you're capable at your current SR, and switch to a second healer. You'd be surprised how well a Mercy / DPS Moira combo can work in some flanker-heavy games. If you see a gap in your team, fill it.02/14/2018 04:50 PMPosted by HireathMoira have a healing bar who can be empty really fast if you start healing each individual :( She can't solo heal a team, She need a second healer !To be honest, that's not true at all unless you're playing into a shield heavy comp. You'll definitely need a second healer / moira to switch if solo healing if you're playing into, say, a Rein/Orisa combo. Moira will never have enough healing juice to go around in those circumstances.However, if you're playing into any other combo (D.va Hog combo is super common in my games as an example), Moira is incredibly capable as a solo healer. Like anything else, the team does have to be more focused on playing together as a group to take full advantage of Moira's AOE healing, but you can push out 25k+ solo healing in a ctp comp match without a problem.","

"So ive decided to make this post to, hopefully; make the forums a better place and to teach people to argue like the rational species we are, if only i change a few people or someone learns something thats good for meFirst of all, Starting from the very basics, How to use the tools at your disposalMany people seem to think using caps or bold text to shout is a good way to make your argument strong, It doesntBolded text should primarily be used to highlight important parts of an argument, as to make a TL;DR of your argument for people in a rush or it can be used to create sub-titles mid text to properly make your message cleanUnderlined should generally be used for titling and can also be used for highlighting; but its less noticeable than bold Caps should be used very lightly; to start up a sentence, as writting everything in caps is portrayed as aggresive, a proper arguing person has no reason to be aggressive, that makes you look bad or immature other than that it can look good to highlight titles or to priorize a title over the otherLists are extremely useful when trying to say multiple things refering to one same general topic, Like im doing right now, it makes an message look clean, and it makes it easier to read Quotes should be used to point out what your responding to, or who, it can get confusing if no one quotes anything and all you have is loose messages, Also, its a good way to show examples of posts Theres not much use for italics really, i recommend to use it when quoting someone when you cant actually use the quote system because its not in the forumsProper filtering your textGenerally, when you want to argument something, You dont want to make a giant wall of text as that is confusing to read, everything bends in together and nullifies eachother, Proper titling is very important it filters the content of your giant wall of text, For the sakes of an example, imagine that im making a post about nerfing mei  (this is just an example!!What is wrong with mei?Mei has been a must pick since the game has started, she has had 80% pickrate in OWL, and has been dominating matchmaking, her primary fire does too much damage and its extremely frustrating to fight againstThe solutionEndothermic Blaster:Reduce damage From 100 to 50decrease freeze duration from 5 seconds to 2.5It also makes it easier for people to quote your post by sections  and respond to it in partsProper arguing mannersBe chill: Arguing in all bold and caps like a gorilla doesnt make you smarter, its much easier to respect a calm and composed argument than a guy shouting in angerDo not attack the person: This is something i see very often, Attacking a person on a personal level to prove that their wrong is dumb; Stuff like ""Oh your plat shut up"" or ""You say that because your stupid"" is a big no noBack your argument up with data:This is self explanatory, its much easier to understand someone saying ""Jeff kaplan is op, he has 99% pickrate and 70% winrate across all tiers, and he has higher average elims than any other dev Provide where you got your data:This is important, as the data you might be basing your argument on could be wrong, and its important to know this. Do NOT attack grammar: Same as the second suggestion,attacking someone because of their grammar and underappreciating their opinion due to grammar is wrong, Dont get me wrong, proper grammar is important to avoid misunderstandings but dont attack someone because of it!Notify edits: If your editting a post,you want to notify others where and what you have editted, especially if people have already saw your message, if you dont this can cause people not to notice this and cause a misunderstanding!This is all for now ill edit the post if i want to add anything else","

"Now, now, I know that they're not exactly alike, and that there are differences. But bear with me as i'll try to explain my logic here.Both Mei and Roadhod are about disrupting the enemy team.- Mei uses her wall, and to a small extent her main fire freeze ability, to disrupt the enemy's teamwork.- Roadhog uses his hook to grab enemy players out of their position, therefore also disrupting the enemy's teamwork.Both Mei and Roadhog are made to be able to defend a certain area, due to their strength in close combat and their ability to 1v1.- Mei accomplishes this by using her increased survivability, together with her main fire freeze.- Roadhog accomplished this with his ability to hook-stun enemies, as well as his high damage in close-to-mid range combat.Both Mei and Roadhog have a ""selfish"" ability that allows them to increase their own survivability, by sacrificing damage.- Mei uses Cryo Freeze to null any damage to her and heal her in the process. She can't deal any damage while doing so.- Roadhog uses Take a Breather to heal himself for more than cryo, but has a reduced damage taken while doing so, instead of a full immunity.---So let's say, for argument's sake, that Roadhog does indeed fulfill the same role as Mei. Let's take a look at how they compare.Roadhog is a tank, which means that he disrupts the enemy team. And while he'll generally have lower overal damage done when compared to DPS, he offsets that with increased survivability.Mei is a defensive hero, who is also made to disrupt the enemy team. She, as Roadhog, generally does less dps than regular dps. She also has increased survivability compared to other heroes.Now if you look at it like this, they seem rather similar. However! While Mei's damage is probably about as high as Roadhog's overal (if not lower!) she has nowhere near the tankiness of Roadhog.While this is partially offset by her smaller size, it's nowhere near enough to be called even.---Now while lots of people say she's supposed to be a disruptor, I ask you this:When, exactly, is a disruptor worth the sheer loss of damage, compared to a normal dps such as Soldier?And when, exactly, when you want a disruptor, would you not just take a tank, who can arguably fulfill that role better, while having better survivability?---The way I personally see it, and note that this is all just my opinion, is that while Mei does do her job well as a disruptor, she has too little damage. Making it so that there's more value to be had in just picking heroes such as Soldier, or Junkrat, who can easily do incredibly high amounts of damage. Disrupting the enemy team just very VERY rarely seems to be worth more than the raw damage of other heroes. ---What do you guys think about this? Do you feel the current Mei changes on the ptr are what she needs? Or would you prefer more survivability? Perhaps more damage? Or maybe some added effect, allowing for Mei to disrupt the enemy team more?Looking forward to what you guys think!Cheers.","

I'd like a slight rework for McCree with these changes:1. Change McCree's primary damage to 752. Change McCree's fall off damage to 40 at the low end3. Remove Fan the Hammer from the game4. Give McCree 250 hpWith those changes McCree becomes a better anti-flanker that rewards skill.,"

"Okay i this is just my opinion so if you say ""its overpowered or bs"" please state reasoning so i can comment....thank youSo i looked at the new changes they are looking at for Sombra, Mei and Doomfist. I liked a bit of it but one thing I've been wondering why dont they make Sombra's Ultimate EMP cancel transformation based Ultimate's. Before i go into this more they are testing her with her hacking ability affecting mercy's angelic ascent. The reason why i think it would be beneficial is because it would help make her viable, most players who play Sombra myself included get negative comments for playing her and sometimes you face those players who play torb, bastion and winston as examples. Though it does take great timing for canceling their ultimates but for newer players they find it difficult.So for example of a situation if they made this change to her so your facing one or many of these players it helps her and her team make better engages and make more of an offensive then defensive character.The other thing i would like to change is that when Sombra is hacking torbs turret it doesnt auto target her so she can actually hack it So if you like to comment and see if you can see these changes being good or bad Thank You","

"I don't think Torb's level 2 turret is the problem.  I think his level 1 turret needs a buff (I'd say a much shorter cooldown, which would open up new strategies of being able to place level 1 turrets quicker as they become destroyed) as well as his armor packs to better support the team.  He should also be able to place an armor pack on his turret if he so chooses.Level 1 turret should be more of a mobile low-health turret -- if you've ever played TF2, think of TF2 mini-turretsLevel 2 turret is more stationary and powerful","

Repair and refilling ammo takes priority over upgrading.The only difference however is the TF2 sentry can actually hold it's own and be a threat even at level 1. A scout that tries to take out a level 1 sentry with an Engineer hitting it dies almost 100% of the time.","

"<span class=""truncated"">...</span> Sombra is an orphan, and I don't think she knows any of her other family, even if she has others, the friend possibility is still thereSecret daughter?This is highly doubtful. Sombra is not the ""mother type"" nor is she the type to be given a child. She is written to be the character that knows everything. A plot character, giving her a child would be pointless and irrelevant for the sake of a name.For all we know, it could be her ""ded name"" or a name that she use to give to the people of Mexico to know her by before she became ""Sombra"". She has relations to the bakery, as she is seen as a child with baked goods giving it to the head of police (Odds are is the mother of Alejandra took Sombra in as a child, and Alejandra is more like a ""little sister"" possibly in ways, but that's pushing the envelope as Alejandra spilled her location BUT who says that Alehandra's last name and her mother's last name isn't Colomar? IF they took Sombra in, since she was an orphan, odds are is you'd give your last name to the child if they don't have any) She also was most likely affiliated with the Los Muertos Gang as a young adolescent (The skin she has and hence her tagging things everywhere) so she possibly started to become ""Sombra"" latter as the woman giving her the implants was of the gang itself.The name cannot be found by anybody as all of her data was erased so that makes me wonder exactly HOW they found her name... The only way someone could find out her name is if they have connections to the ""Iris"" that saw Sombra as a young woman. Sombra wouldn't give out her name to anyone as that leaves her wide open for being found out. The whole point of Sombra is that she is working undercover. It doesn't make sense for this ""professional hacker"" who is giving plot to the story to be easily found out. It defeats the purpose of who she is. If so, that is pretty lazy writing in my opinion >.> Her name is odd indeed as even I mentioned the name to my cousin and he said ""That doesn't sound Mexican at all"" I even tried looking up the last name's origins but found nothing. Even Reaper's last name (Reyes) is ""more Mexican"" than Sombra's which leads me to believe she isn't that stupid (hopefully...for the sake of her character) Now, can Sombra be of mixed decent? Yes, as Pharah is so we don't know really and Sombra is a mystery (Though Pharah's Rainmaker and Thunderbird skins showed otherwise whereas Sombra has nothing really on her to signify this) however, the odd thing about this, is that Sombra played it off very smoothly. She looked surprised but shook it off fast (Yes, probably because she had no time to dwindle on it being in her position, but I expected a more ""angry reaction"" if you will. Especially if you were really found out, which shows it's probably a placeholder name)","

All supports.Mercy has the highest play time because I play her when:1) I'm watching my shows.2) I'm knitting things to donate/for friends/for self.3) Playing with friends so I have to keep them alive as much as possible. (Also talking more than paying attention to the fight)But my main is Lucio for payloads.Ana for open maps.Moira (now) in general.Sym when I'm really bored and don't care about winning because she's garbage and expecting to win as Sym is silly.Zenny when I feel like being a birb boi who kills things with mah floating eggies.If I am super drunk I usually play xbox OW using Soldier/Genji because I don't need much brain power to play them successfully and about 20% of the time flailing around on the controller gets me where I need to go. lmao,"

"Reaper and Moira. Reaper because I learned to be good with him, and now being decent with him (I wont say I'm actually good because I often suck at the game but compared to other heroes im better with Reaper.) It's just what I'm used to. Also I like his character/appearance. Edgy is my aesthetics.Moira I picked up nearly instantly. She just came so naturally to me, she was the playstyle I was looking for and trying to get out of Zenyatta but he's not well built enough for it. I enjoy healing, but I also like being a DPS, (also I'm not like most I will put healing over my DPS.) so Moira was right up my alley in terms of play style. If we need a support I'm insta locking Moira, she's my support main.","

Doomfist because he's fun as hell to play and I'm getting decently good with him. Sombra because I suck as a healer and often can do as much healing with hacked health packs as I do with mercy and moira, Ana I can out heal them all on but I find i get dived on a lot and burned down quickly. Zarya because if there is a main tank already picked I want to be able to do decent off tanking with a high amount of damage out put and I suck using dva's Defense matrix.","

"I'm not sure who said, but there is a term often associated with Overwatch,""The Only constant is you.""This is objectively false.Simply put, the other constant that I can choose in this game is the most important; my teammates.To cut to the chase, Overwatch is a game that rewards teamwork, that's not a bad thing by any means, but the group function that is allowed in comp causes quite a bit of problems on its own, and I'm not talking about 6 solo players going up against a six stack. Some people believe that a solo and group queue should be implement to even this out, but in my experiences playing in peak low times I would say that there aren't actually enough players to make a system like this function well.I think that the group function as it stands in comp suffers from 2 major issues.1. SR averaging. Mostly this is when a group of two players join together because one person is hoping to have the other person carry them and the other is using the lower SR person to artificially reduce their SR. Now the worst that could happen here would be, for example, a 2500 player and a 3000 player playing in the 2750 range.Now, on a personal note, I don't think this is that big of a issue because more often than not the low player isn't ready to play at the higher tier and the higher player can't actually carry the team like they think, but I see the real victims here are the other four teammates who have to suffer with the two stack.If it were up to me, to dissuade this from happening I would have the group's SR default to the highest ranked player.2. The Group chat. I play on the  Xbox One, and I think that the worst thing about playing and seeing a stack is in your team is the 50/50 chance that they aren't going to join team chat. you can message them to join or try to get their attention, but they either don't know how to or refuse to do so. What I find so frustrating about this is the overwhelming probability that the stack actually all have mics, yet they refuse to talk to the rest of their team and you have to suffer for their stubbornness. Furthermore, as I stated, I play on the Xbox One and with that there is also a Party chat through Xbox Live so a person in your game may be in a party by themselves or with players in other games while you are stuck with a mute teammate.Communication is key in being an effective team, so I think that something can be done to help remedy this problem.In comp I think that Group chat should be removed as the default in settings so people can't forget to switch to team chat or have to manually mute all teammates if they would rather play in silence. Further, I recall in COD MW2 back on the 360, party chat's would be inaccessible in certain game modes or would not be available when a party was active. If this were available for comp specifically, then I believe quality of life for matches would improve.As for QP or arcade, I could honestly care less.","

"I actually think the grouping problem could be fixed by encouraging more people to group.Right now, it's hard to find a group in competitive. If the only people you know in real life don't play Overwatch, or play but at a significantly different SR (higher or lower) you get stuck.If we could make finding a group at your SR an easier process, it would be a big help. This comes back to a LFG system and a clan system. Both are social tools which would give us more power over who we go into a competitive match with.Sure a 6 stack that always plays together is probably going to be better co-ordinated than the 6 stack that was just formed 5 minutes ago in a LFG lobby, but it's still far preferable to a 4 stack and a 2 stack being shoved into a group against that same 6 stack. Or even worse, a group of solo players facing that 6 stack.With those social tools, it should be easier to form groups and therefore easier to match groups against each other for the matchmaking system. We just need the barriers to forming groups lowered.Right now if you don't have anyone to play with, your only option is to use a third party service or discord to find a group. That doesn't work great because it's a lot of hassle so not many people use those things, so it's harder to find a group using them.","

"I've said this before, allowing solo queues and stacks in the same party is a mistake.Comp originally only allowed a full stack to play, and the game still had toxicity back then, but it got much worse once they allowed solo queue.Quickplay was taken more seriously, because the solo queue people couldn't go to comp on their own, and comp wasn't clogged with all these players with some superiority complex, because stacks are usually more satisfied with their matches and were able to build comps that revolved around the heroes they WANTED to playIMO, they should re-introduce the stack only queue, BUT not before they implement some kind of guild system (which a lot of people want). That way people who want to do comp are able to find others of a similar mind, and they;d be able to build better comps around each other's preferences.","

It's like how the floating orbs around the spawn-side teleporter represent TP charges remaining, you don't really notice it until you know what to look for.Edit: I went to the training range with the classic skin to test it out, and yeah you can see her charge on the gun.

He seems like good defense, take high ground but his damage drop off is so fast, unless you’re hitting every shot, you aren’t doing much. Attack seems good cause allows you to get in his sweet range more often. However, he’s so immobile, unless you have a mercy that stays on you, it’s really hard to survive.He’s not much of a tank buster... fan just tickles them and they take to many hits to kill before they can kill you.He’s not really anti flanker.

Flash bang is to quick to finish them off w fan the hammer.Like what scenario exists where you go... “hey we can use a mccree here!”?Yeah I guess he’s the best at killing Pharah but if you piss a good one off, she can be quite difficult so still gotta give upper hand to her in most cases.What’s his role do you think he performs best in and how do you tend to figure if he’s what the team needs?","

"McCree is a hero that needs to be protected to a certain extent to be effective. he has amongst the highest damage potential if he hits headshots and fth is an underrated ability for quickly dealing a large amount of damage (i typically use on tanks or shields)flashbang can also help you delete characters that are not careful around you and if coordinated with teammates can be incredibly deadly. (i used to coordinate with a reinhardt to flashbang above the barrier and then immedietly earth shatter).some misconceptions about McCreehe does not directly counter flankers like Tracer and Genji, but given the right circumstances, he can instantly delete them.he does not directly counter pharah, but he can duel her on a reasonably consistent basis (as opposed to someone like Reaper who can tickle her at best)when do you want to pick him?if your aim feels on point and you have a team that you feel you can rely on to support you. e.g. McCree generally won't work if your team is running dive comp. McCree is a very solid character as is most of the cast, in mercy meta deadeye was one of the best ways to delete valkyrie mercy","

"It's a pet peeve of mine when the animated cinematics show the heroes doing things they can't do in game.I was quite happy when D.Va gained the ability to attack while boosting, and I'm a proponent of Reaper gaining some kind of concussive grenades like he often has in animated form.Which leads me to Hanzo.Despite being desperately in need of a rework, and in all likelihood being removed from the game soon, Scatter Arrow featured prominently in the Dragons short.Rather than introduce a discrepancy,  I propose an elegant solution:When Scatter Arrow is retired, take the visual effects from it, the tiny rebounding bits, and add those to Sonic Arrow. Thus they become tiny auditory sensors that disperse in the area and provide the sonar pings that Hanzo's imaging tech uses to see through the walls.The integrity of the Dragons short is preserved without being at the expense of any gameplay issues. Nice and tidy.","

"So I've given some thought to what I don't like about over watch is banning system. What I really don't like about it is the players inability to see reports against them. I'm not saying we should know who reported us. What I'm saying is we should use an infraction system to know why we were reported. My best example of this is narutobase.net. While you could not see what you were reported for, whenever you had an infraction, you were told exactly why the mods weren't happy. This could be implemented in a similar way to improve the over watch community. My idea would not only tell people why they're being reported, but also confirms to the reporter that the report was sent in and has been actually seen by the user they reported. The reported user's reaction would also be able to tell Blizzard weather not they will actually improve their behavior, whether or not they keep being toxic or keep on griefing. Users, who wish to improve their behavior can more easily do so.","

"02/12/2018 07:41 PMPosted by Acestial(Please take time to read this all. The down votes are from those who have not read it.) p.s. someone is on a down vote spree to make it look like I dislike other's opinions and which I have not down voted or will not anyone on this thread.One of Reapers abilities, wraith form is proof to Reaper being a wraith.By definition a wraith is a ghost or ghostlike image of someone, especially one seen shortly before or after their death.Reaper was seen shortly after his death when Mercy supposedly saved him, but did she really?Let's look at the big picture.Mercy can ressurect people, but for a price. Mercy didn't exactly resurrect Reaper though.A wraith is also an apparition of a living person supposed to portend his or her death.Meaning, the Reaper that we all see and know ISN'T Gabriel Reyes at all, but a mere after image of him.Now I know what you may be thinking, hold the phone, he is able to do physical interaction right? NOPE.Another aspect of wraiths are their powers, since they are considered spirits they are able to manipulate with a supernatural force.Wraiths, in lore, can alter human perception and use psychic powers to manipulate the environment. This gives us a view about why his shotguns always disappear when he drops them and how he makes new one's out of thin air.The facts all add up. Reaper isn't Gabriel Reyes. Reaper is a apparition of who Gabriel Reyes was.This is ridiculous.","

"Honestly I’m still more afraid of a tracer and genji because they can apply constant pressure even if your grouped, and still secure kills with thier high burst. Sombra still will constantly have to leave the fight and run back. She’s much easier for support to fight back against. She’s really only going to punish people that stray off on thier own. If your with a team she’s going to have to quickly leave after taken any damage.Just relax. She is still one of the lowest on the dps spectrum, hacks are still the same cooldown, people won’t even notice these changes unless they are playing sombra.  A ten percent reduction still has plenty of spread, Translocator time was too short to begin with. They explained the typo on opportunist it doesn’t see you through walls till 50% like normal these are all just quality of life things. None is close to game breaking. Then they buffed hacks against passive that normally just stalled until the hack is over. And all these hero’s primaries still out burst her. She also lost health pack ult charge which is huge. That’s not a emp every fight anymore. It’s all a bunch of small thing with a big hit to hero that was being out done by every other hero statistically speaking.","

Strafing like a madman - only 50% to D.va health i could drain up before she kills me under shield gen. Every halfdecent dps also kills her pretty fast.

"Hacking Lucio is consistent because the songs are an effect of Crossfade (the ability), which is just a permanently channeled Shift ability whenever Lucio switches songs.Once he gets hacked, Crossfade is disabled, so the song effect also stops--much like hacking Bastion ends Sentry mode, not just preventing him from going in or out of it.edit: Is it fair to Lucio, whose pick rate has been bleh recently?  Maybe not, but it does position Sombra in a very good spot to counter quad tank before it becomes a festering plague on the meta like Mercywatch.","

Lucio will be the only support who literally loses his entire kit outside of shooting when hacked and has his ult deleted by EMP without requiring much effort.First thank you for being sensible. Second, the only counter point I would put out, is that Lucio is an off support. He's there for speed boosting the team but.... In reality most Lucio's play him just to wall ride, and boop people off the map. To that end, the Sombra buffs do not affect him. He can still do that, she hacks while he boops her, he's vulnerable, and she's flung off the map.  However, if he is where he supposed to be... surounded by tanks/dps... then she is going to have a much harder time getting to him to hack and then kill him. Perhaps his ult interaction should be looked at... but then again a lot of heroes can straight lose their ults to a normal sombra hack. He only loses it to her ult. Meanwhile, an enemy Ana can negate a Zen ult with her grenade.","

ThanksFrom what i understand though placements (apart from your first) are not really that - They just hide your rank for 10 games and you basically place +/- 200 from where you were depending on how you went in those 10 games. Or at least thats how it was in s1-4. Have they changed placements so its not more of a reset?So the system will let us queue for placements and then not after if the difference is over 1000? I think it used to be 500?,"

At this point Mercy is just pickrate damage control.There's never a point to using your gun, which is why mercy feels one-dimensional. When was the last time you've seen a Mercy actively defend herself? She has a better chance if she just hides from them with Guardian Angel. The least they could do is turn Guardian Angel into a more defensive ability when her gun is out. Make it targetless and self-burst heal on a 10 second cool down.","

"As always i want to drop my opinion in the forums.So, we know that NOT every hero is relevant in the pro-scene or meta and some heroes would be played more than others, that's a fact so...I'm worry about all these RE-WORK thing, the game is young because and in my opinion some these heroes don't really need a rework at all, just adjust the numbers up or down and do the same with other heroes.For example: HanzoIn my opinion, he """"just need"""" down the damage of the Scatter arrow, because is one of the MAIN problem, he can literally ONE-SHOT from the distance any hero in the game. So, maybe decreasing the damage of this ability to a max of 220 damage?, while increasing the damage or attack speed of the basic attacks. And to make him ""more relevant"" and useful in the meta, could have a mix between the SONIC ARROW with a small area stunt/disorientation, like the sonic arrow 2.0 has the ability to see around and also Stunt or slow heroes who are in a the small area of HIT, like a ""flashback grenade""You guys can also increase the movement speed while is doing a normal attack and also reduce the charge time of these attacks.So many things can be done before event thing on add a completely NEW ability.Another example would be TORBJORNHe is really fun hero but maybe not so ""useful"" in pro scene. And is because the turrets takes LONG to build at lvl 2 and lack of mobility of course.So maybe the turret has ""Auto-build"" like Symmetra turrets but over the time, lets say 5 seconds? but if you HAMMER the turrets you build it faster than you normally do right now. So, you could drop it and it will auto-build in 5 seconds, or you can hammer the turret and do it in 2-3 seconds?To not make this hero ""OPAF"", the turret could be no 360 view turret and has maybe a CONE attack, like 180, instead of 360. And also reduce the auto-aim accuracy or aim speedAnother thing is decrease or increase the distance of the view of the turret (i think right now is a bit long, could be shorter)About armor, could be like every time an enemy or friend die. That drops INSTANT armor of 10 if Torb is around, so while your friends can pick up, Torb also can pick op and convert them into ""super armor"" when dropped by him with like 60? instead of 50 or maybe more, i don't know, so would be like 10+60. So Torb can create these super armor and players can pick up normal armor from the floor.So to not make this endless, i'm a bit ""against"" of RE-WORKING every hero, because is not used or relevant in the meta, i know this changes help the game to bring fresh strategies and new stuff and made heroes relevant, but let's be honest, not every hero needs to be relevant and useful in competitive. What would also help is have new heroes a bit more often.REMEMBER this is ALL my opinion and ideas, just bringing some ideas and things that can be done with what we have right now instead of RE-WORK a cool hero. In any case, forgiven my engrish! :PEDIT: title","

"WOW i receive some thumbs down! XDAnyway, after watching the Developer Update of Feb 14, 2018Sounds really interesting!...I like the changes on Mei, would be nice to see it in action same as Sombra, i think this will bring back more Sombra mains to the game! :DDoomfist seen like a little buff, nothing to say about Doomfist other than make him more OP so he can INSTA-KILL anybody in the game... just kidding! XDAbout Hanzo, i have mixed feelings... maybe because i'm a ""Hanzo main"" XD... but sounds really interesting, specially if the pierce arrow pass through the shields, but sounds ""to OP"" in some cases. Mainly because there are few abilities right now (that can remember) that pass through barriers/shields and they are ""slow"" abilities (Symmetra's secondary fire, Moira's orb, Hanzo's Dragon, Reinhardt's charge, Doomfist's Rocket Punch, etc..). And we can ""easily"" dodge them. But if the Pierce Arrow is as fast as a Widow shot, people is going to complain about it, except with be like the old days of QUAKE were you have the RAIL gun and shot without the zoom.In my opinion will be a game changer ability, because now you wont really need anything to break the shield of a (Orisa or Rein) + (Bastion or Torb) combo, so ""no more"" Pirate Ship and people will calling out the Hanzo Mains! XD...""Dude, switch to HANZO..."" instead of... ""Hanzo don't work dude, switch!"" hehe...About the Leap... WOW that sounds GOOD, i have to try that.About Symmetra and Torb, i have already gave my opinion here...https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761777106#post-1And herehttps://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761687589?page=8#post-141Anyway, great changes looking forward... thx!","

Lol but whatevs.I'm fine with it. As annoying as she'll be I am tired of the same two flankers chasing me and just failing to do f* all. Maybe Sombra can be a new cat in the cat and mouse game I play with flankers. You just get so used to Tracer and Genji's tells that nerfing them is just redundant at this point.Fix Genji's hitbox though other than that they really arent a big issue. They suffer the same as support, when you gut and nerf heroes in their class another rises to take the spotlight. We need more supports and less nerfs just as we need the rest of the dps line up to be less situational and more viable.","

"I know there's probably no perfect match making system but I think competitive play should change the queuing system, where players select a preferred role (dps, support, tank, fill, etc) before being put in the que. I can't tell you how many matches I've lost because players refuse to change off their favorite DPS even though it's not what the team needs. I typically fill by playing tank or healer and enjoy those roles, but if the other 5 players aren't onboard then there might as well be a surrender option and take the lose since it's a waste of time dealing with trolls for an entire match. Add a feature like Yeti Hunter had where people can have a preferred role (not guaranteed) and match making selects at least one queued healer, tank and DPS and leaves the other positions opened to ""fill"". Just a thought. Tired of losing games before they even start is all.","

I doubt that you actually had matches with Reaper, Pharah, and Hog all in the same game and didn't get utterly trashed.And at 7 games won, your gamepool isn't exactly high to have a meaningful percentage.","

And I am steamrolling with Winston near 80% win rate.You have the freedom of jumping the back line and bc of cooldown you can go literally untouched. Jump high to start cooldown. Land, punch, bubble, shock, kill. Jump out. No consequences. I can even still run him is they are playing reaper hog pharah. Winston needs to be strong to counter alot of bs but I'm not sure he deserves to jump in and out with no punishment.Suggestion.Jump CD starts after you land. I can easily hang air with Winston for 2-3 seconds. Then CD is next to nothingReaper and roadhog say hi.","

"I'm a Crusader, I love to crusade. But D.Va is truly a God amongst us tanks right now. You can bring her to dive, you can bring her as the off tank for a death ball, and she fits perfect into a 3 tank comp.So I play all the tanks, and lately I've picked up D.Va more and more, and I'm shredding things. This is what I've learned: 1⃣️  She counters Moira's Orbs. You would think this isn't a big deal, but ask any of the Moira players here, they will tell you that not getting full use out of their orbs can slow their healing economy and healing output. She can also dive/spike Moria hard with her rockets after Moira shifts away. 2⃣️ Her mobility is fantastic. She contests snipers on the higher ground like no other. I've also noticed if I can hit most my rockets on Pharah, she is good as done. This allows her to be good for dive or death-ball, she is just about a perfect fit into any comp.3⃣️  Her ultimate is one of the best in the game imo. Why? You get it rather fast, and it can be combo'd with all the CC ultimates in the game to great effect, or you can simply zone out/clear the enemy on the point for the finishing win. Also many good D.Va players know how valuable being in Mec is so they will Self-Destruct when they start to die just so they can get back into mech faster. It's really good.4⃣️  DM with Boosters is incredible. Yes DM can still help counter enemy ults, but where she really shines is her ability to combine her DM with her Boosters to get out and save her mech. I've learned good D.Va players are very aware of their health, and try their best to stay in mech so they can keep harassing. 5⃣️  She counters most of the hero roster. I couldn't believe how effective she is against heroes like Junkrat. If you can dive him with Dm, Rockets, and then unload, he drops like a rock. 6⃣️  Boosters plus punch/melee. This isn't to be underestimated, this a combo of 25+30 damage. 55 Damage. It's perfect for finishing move (like a weaker Genji dash imo). To conclude. I think D.Va is the best tank in Overwatch. I used to bring Winston as my off-tank for mobility, or dive, but I'm starting to realize D.Va's kit can do more. I feel like she is good in the mid-fight and late-fight. Plus with all the Moira's running around, she fits so perfectly into a team comp. I'm not going to hang up my hammer just yet, but I'm going to be playing D.Va a lot more. I actually feel like I maybe able to climb the ladder with her. And for someone like me, who enjoys shot-calling, you couldn't ask for a better hero to climb with.","

"I dunno man, I find D.Va to be extremely weak to a Roadhog of equal skill if it's a 1v1 scenario. Roadhog specializes in 1v1s, D.Va doesn't. Roadhog can heal all the damage she does and can live through her ult at point-blank-range with his Take-A-Breather. You can destroy her mech-suit in about 2 (sometimes 3) shots if you can get some crit-damage in there. She can't fly away from you if you manage your cooldowns properly, as you can just hook her back to you. It's all about cooldown management. She can't stop your ultimate with Defense Matrix either, lasts too long, and if she stays in your face she's going to get knocked out of her mech.Something interesting, if you hook someone and then hit Q as the hook begins to reel in, they will take a HUGE amount of burst damage and burst knockback, which is sometimes even enough to just one-shot her mech.Roadhog is also the only (practical) self-sufficient Tank, he contains self-heals, has amazing damage, and he doesn't need high mobility as he can use his Hook to pull in from far away, or use Take-A-Breather for escaping. I'm TERRIBLE with weapon accuracy, slow projectiles are my speciality though so I have an over 60% hook accuracy.","

"I think it would great to give a smoke bomb (either as granate or arrow). Granate should be good with his new evade ability. Also, having a smoke screen combos really well with sonic arrow. Smoke the enemy, and see where are they through this combo. Also smoke screen will help nearby allies to escape as well.Another argument: he is ninja, ninja must have smoke bomb.Another idea is to have fire arrow as area denial. And then combo that with combustible smoke. That would be sick, and not too OP (at the end of the day, area denial abilities in the game are not that powerful).","

How would the smoke work from your PoV? Would your team see a giant smoke cloud and be unable to see where enemies are unless you have Sonic Arrow? What visual indicator can it give your team so they know the smoke is being used?,"
						Feb 15
					",,,,,,,
"I assume like being in a thick fog. I guess smoke should cover space around 10-15 m in diameter for 2-3 sec, maybe with fade effect. Players on both sides should not be able to see much in the smoke (maybe 2-3 meters ahead). Sonic arrow should reveal red silhouettes and help your teammates to shoot in the right direction. However sonic arrow would not reveal any barriers, just silhouettes, so the enemy could actually be hiding behind the barrier in the smoke.For players outside, smoke would block line of sight and it may effect heroes abilities. For example soldier tacvizor would not auto aim through the smoke. Smoke could also interact with the abilities. For example, D.Va bomb could disperse smoke completely.","
