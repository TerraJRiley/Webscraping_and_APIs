People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.",12/19/2017 06:07 AM,"{""id"":""207590682540"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":9,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207438106439"",""name"":""Osprey""}}",post-19,4473 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Osprey-11747,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000197B.png,Girl Gamers,1000

It will be true when people stop bullying girls for being girls. Until this, problem should be highlighted to be noticed and fixed.
One of the reasons some people bully girls is because many feel the need to identify themselves as ""girl gamers"", which is annoying and unnecessary.

e: I should clarify I'm not condoning bullying of any kind.

my guy I get bullied for being a girl the moment I say anything in team chat. it’s not a “well girls are labeling themselves as girl gamers so that’s why they’re getting harassment”, I’m getting harassment for just talking. I’m lucky and have a deep voice and most of the time they think I’m a boy, people with higher voices (and boys with high pitched voices get made fun of too) don’t get that.",12/19/2017 06:34 AM,"{""id"":""207591581480"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207519477502"",""name"":""issh0man""}}",post-31,2806 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/issh0man-1306,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D58.png,Girl Gamers,1000

I would not say harassment is equivalent to everyone. People will get harassed for different things and that is inherently not equivalent. The person who plays for like 1600 hours will get harassed for playing too much while the newbie will get harassed for not being that good. You can't really be targeted for playing too much if you literally have like <1 hr of play.

No, he is complaining about mentioning gender. And yes, they are doing it right by mentioning their gender - this way they are talking about the problem.

For males more easy answer is ""hahaha, calm down, there is no problem, you are exaggerating"" - just because ignoring this issue will not hurt them (us, I'm a male) and doesn't require any additional actions or changes.
People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.


If you face similar bullying you should understand how tiring it is for someone to hear your voice, once, and to immediately be faced with backlash.

It isn't a matter of muting them, or turning a blind eye, or even leaving the game, because that doesn't stop them. Their goal is to make you uncomfortable. It's not funny, it's not something you can ignore, it's freaking exhausting.",12/19/2017 07:13 AM,"{""id"":""207590482405"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207579296002"",""name"":""Poe""}}",post-45,43 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Poe-11501,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000030B.png,Girl Gamers,1000

""Equality"" hasn't been about being equal for at least a decade.

that's because everyone nowadays wants to be more Equal than the person next to them

it's one of few things that actually bother me about society as a whole nowadays

a little while back some people on the internet decided to put up signs that said

""it's ok to be white.""

even made it a point to make it as non threatening as possible handwriting and design wise

the news media villainized the whole thing treating it as if it were an act of terrorism made by the worst of the worst kind of racists

schools where the sign was placed went as far as to say something to the effect of ""we don't share the views of the signs in question""

after i saw that i just slamed my face so hard into my palm that it slipped off and broke the nearest desk i'm not even kidding you can look it up

Most of us feel that way. Especially those of us that were bullied as a kid.

It seems to me they're upset because of the specific nature of the verbal taunts, rather than the fact that they're being verbally taunted.

Most of us feel that way. Especially those of us that were bullied as a kid.

It seems to me they're upset because of the specific nature of the verbal taunts, rather than the fact that they're being verbally taunted.

Which to me makes almost no difference, but then again that's the male perspective, and you can't just overright female perspective entirely either.

""I'm not sexist, but...""

But yes, I agree, people think the same way about mercy mains & girl gamers in this community: they don't like them and treat them like trash, yet expect them to be around to pick them back up.


I'm 100% sure if most people treated mercy mains like trash they wouldn't play the game, especially not with their voice as a girl.

Especially not in this meta where she's viable. I've seen people beg for a mercy in like half my games this season, they're very much appreciated, at least from my experience this season.

In game, yes.

Because that's not how things work. Targeting specific things is how things get solved, and how in depth discussions occur.

Would you have told a suffragette that they shouldn't be focusing on women being able to vote and instead focusing on civil rights for everyone? Would you say that the NAACP and other groups that target discrimination towards specific groups shouldn't exist, because they should just all be one big group against all discrimination?Would you tell someone trying to save one forest that they shouldn't be doing that because they should save all the forests?

Yeah, all issues should be addressed, but telling them that they're wrong for wanting to address specific aspects of a problem just distracts from actually solving anything.

Activists specialize for a reason. People fight for specific causes for a reason. If everyone tried to fix everything at once, nothing would get solved. Progress is won by passion, and passion works best in a concentrated form.

I'm a Gay Gamer

I'm a Black Gamer

I'm a White Gamer

No because that's ridiculous to ask of a single person

if they have the power to save all the forests they still shouldn't stop saving the forest in question that would be self defeating if you plan on saving ALL of the forests

Only if they waste time debating it and don't actually listen in the end~

If everyone tried to fix everything at once, nothing would get solved. You can't win a war without fighting battles first.


there are a few issues with this focusing on the female side of toxicity isn't even fighting a proper battle but instead just a skirmish and it doesn't solve anything alone the problem will still persist and at some point a portion of females will start to take advantage of their new vantage point especially if it's poorly handled and trust me it will be poorly handled

the difference between then and now is we humans have access to the internet we can change things much faster than ever before we are all connected together

that whole forest thing? somewhere in the world there has to be at least 1000 Like minded individuals who could work together to accomplish much more than what that 1 person could possibly do multiplicativly

Civilrights would take a bit longer because people are insufferable sometimes especially when it comes to politics >.>

No, he is complaining about mentioning gender. And yes, they are doing it right by mentioning their gender - this way they are talking about the problem.

For males more easy answer is ""hahaha, calm down, there is no problem, you are exaggerating"" - just because ignoring this issue will not hurt them (us, I'm a male) and doesn't require any additional actions or changes.
People are lazy and selfish.
""Talking about the problem""? By drawing attention to their sex, and giving trolls and internet meanguys fuel to use against them? You know how sharing/liking facebook posts doesn't stop people from murdering sharks for their fins? Calling yourself a ""girl gamer"" doesn't stop jerks from using whatever they can to bother you.

Talking about it can only help so much, because chances are, the people you're trying to talk to already know what they're doing is bad.

If girls or whoever want anything to change, then they have to compromise. For one, they can accept that not everyone will treat them fairly. Then they have to realize that they're being treated like every other gamer out there, and if they don't like it, they can calmly exit the gaming scene or stick to offline games.

Every gamer experiences bullying and harassment from both men and women; there is no world in which women are being targeted disproportionately more than men. They experience around the same amount of harassment. The only form of harassment that women face more of is sexual harassment.

And, you know, all of this is subjective. A nongendered insult could be taken as a gendered insult, a nonsexual comment could be taken as a sexual comment, etc. Most trolls aren't picking on women because they are women and they're misogynists. They're simply picking the lowest hanging fruit possible and use it to insult.

For me, it's my sexuality. I don't assume someone calling me the f slur is a homophobe, I just acknowledge that they're just trying to get under my skin. It's not always personal. Trolls just look for the easiest possible way to get at you.

"2-2-2 is the standard, you can branch off from there depending on who is on your team and the map, but we need it. The game to game variation is too high because the matchmaker doesnt care what hero's you play.

One team get's a good comp, one team gets 6 DPS. Whether you climb or fall that day depends on how lucky you get rather than how well you are playing.

Evenutally they are going to do it, just like when the community said that we wanted hero limits, and they gave in, the game got better for it. The question is how long do we have to put up with the most random feeling ladder that I've ever played.

You pick two, could even be the same thing twice
1. Main tank
2. Off Tank
3. DPS
4. Support
5. Flex (you pick your main role but then are willing to have any as the second role)

This would be good foundation for any team.

2-2-2 is the standard, you can branch off from there depending on who is on your team and the map, but we need it. The game to game variation is too high because the matchmaker doesnt care what hero's you play.

One team get's a good comp, one team gets 6 DPS. Whether you climb or fall that day depends on how lucky you get rather than how well you are playing.

Evenutally they are going to do it, just like when the community said that we wanted hero limits, and they gave in, the game got better for it. The question is how long do we have to put up with the most random feeling ladder that I've ever played.

You pick two, could even be the same thing twice
1. Main tank
2. Off Tank
3. DPS
4. Support
5. Flex (you pick your main role but then are willing to have any as the second role)

This would be good foundation for any team. You are free to build it from there but you atleast know you have players willing to fill the main roles decreasing the team to team variation.It wouldnt be perfect and you would still get the off meta one tricks that could put you at a disadvantage but alteast you have the rest covered.

From there you could build a deathball, triple tank, cheese, etc.

you can already find that out. The issue is when it throws to many mercy mains, to many DPS, or to many tank mains on one team when the other team has a nice mix

"even tho jeff believes sombra is fine

i still think she needs more attention, there is a reason she is least popular character in ranked mode on any rank, right?

this season i decided to main her and i got 3890 which was my highest raiting ever, but before that i trained like 30 hours on her

so i can say she really needs more work, sometimes i felt like just bein irritated coz when u play her so much u can feel how raw the hero is

my opinion on sombra:
either let her go insta stealth which will make her way more survivable and mobile, coz often enemy simply sees when u go in stealth and shoots in ur fading figure
or atleast let u receieve some specific damage to be out of stealth. Often i dont want to use my TP in order to drop behind enemy, i want to enter the point in stealth, but random fart from enemy just make u go out of stealth instantly.

Let sombra get specific amount of damage before stop her hack. Its not that simply to hack enemy coz always someon would notice u and attack u before u do, Usually the front like is the most important to hack, but the best odds to hack smn only in the backline. Worst thing mid fight u just waste time on tryin to hack smn, there is always random damage interrupts u, or rapid move of the enemy,
SO either should be more dmn to hack enemy, or atleast mili second less hack cast time.

Make her TP like tracer \ moira work. This travelin time just really really bad in terms of mobility

COnsiderin that she does the lowest damage among all offensive heroes, and her ultimate doesnt even damage, On top of that her ultimate is extremely situational and doesnt gurantee u a kill, I beleive sombra really needs a work

The best and fair way to increase her pickrate and usefullness in the game is simply lettin her hack soldier and genji ultimates.
THose are the dedliest ultimates in game, yet u can hack only the worst ulties
which are easily stoppable by anything else like mcree;s or pharah;s",12/19/2017 01:21 PM,"{""id"":""207590482577"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207578454542"",""name"":""sharla""}}",post-7,44 posts,,https://us.battle.net/forums/static/images/avatars/overwatch/avatar-overwatch-default.png,"Why is Sombra being ignored, But Mercy gets rapid changes",1000

"I know this is a subject that not many of you care about but I find this quite ridiculous. Getting the achievements is rarely about skill, and more about RNG, or actually coordinating with the enemy team, or just basic trolling.

Just now, I played Sym to get her 20 TP achievements... had been trying it fair and square for 2 days straight, but you either get rekt or you destroy the enemy before you can actually get to your 4th TP. So I just put the TP in front of the spawn and walked 6 times through it to get the achievement, not helping my team at all. I would usually report people like that, but there is really no other way.

Achievements should give you a feeling of accomplishment and make you feel proud of the spray you get along with it. Not make you feel ashamed you threw multiple games hard just to farm it. it should be a feasible but hard challenge.

Also, the game is so old now, that most people know how to react to Ult's. Getting 4x kills with Ults is more about luck than skill. You need to play against a bad team, with no Tanks, if possible no healers, and hope for them to be stupid enough to group up when they hear an Ult. Zarya is probably your only chance of seriously accomplishing those but that's still ok, it is a challenge now I guess.

However, there are achievements related to reworks that are close to impossible. D.Va's DM achievement is ridiculous now that her DM uptime has been halved, but the damage has not.

Its technically possible, just a lot more difficult. Have to send someone on the other team a private message via PSN/XBL and ask them that way. Only really works if the other team is a group of 6 so you know they can relay the message to everyone.

I managed to get that one in the heat of the battle, I was on fire and I felt incredibly proud to get that one, but just like you there are some I got which were ridiculous in the way that I got them (I got Widow's flying headshot achievment by shooting in a standing position but because I was in the middle of stairs, it counted as me being in the air... woooohooo)

Also What I don't get, why force us to get it in QP? if, in order to get these achievements we need to collude with the enemy team, why not allow us to get them in custom games? at least that way we don't ruin the matches for people that actually want to play a normal match and not farm achievements... it feels wrong is basically what I'm trying to say and I would love a reaction from the devs, but I guess this won't get enough traction to get there.",12/19/2017 12:56 PM,"{""id"":""207590482565"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207433781348"",""name"":""Rohkah""}}",post-12,812 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Rocca24_7,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000010BB.png,Achievement? more like Trolling,1000

Mass Rez wouldn’t have to be every 30 seconds. Make her ult charge slower than previous. Right now unless you have ult or your team has the advantage it’s too much of a risk to try and get a Rez off mid battle.

I think the difference is you have the ability to alter the end result of the game, where as in gambling you can do nothing to alter your odds or the end result

it's just a skin, it's not going to affect your gameplay.


Actually it does affect your game play subliminally. It's known that gamers that doesn't get any type of 'satisfaction' whether it's beating a boss, getting an item, grinding for gear etc will lose significant interest in the game over time, thus affecting how one may view and play the game in a slight depressed way.

If a player continues to play but is continually dissatisfied time after time, the players view of the game will slowly impact negatively thus resulting in multiple negative behaviours such as bad game play, bad decisions etc etc

Sure the game gives out cosmetic items that doesn't effect the heroes abilities, hit boxes etc, but it's a form of gambling and gaming retention that Blizzard offers to players to keep playing. Overwatch in itself is a casino, they gain more than losses.

But hey people don't understand human, cognitive behaviours will not understand my post and how games do affect a player and their 'skill'.",12/19/2017 06:41 AM,"{""id"":""207591083180"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":19,""voteDown"":9},""author"":{""id"":""186032272453"",""name"":""hasher22""}}",post-4,2305 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/hasher22-1879,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D61.png,1 to 1.5 hour to get 1 loot box,1000

There's no way you can get 1 in 45 minutes. Well, I never played in a group, so I'm not sure. But when I solo.. It is always 1 hour to 1.5 hour to get one.

COmp games take twice as long as QP games, so they give twice as much XP, with a small caveat. In QP, if you don't leave the queue, you'll get a small bonus that you won't recieve in Comp as often.

"I am usually playing about 1-2h per day after work which means that I gather enough items and credits to get everything I want without spending money. If you only play during events however you will probably have a hard time since you are missing so many other items that are not from the event.

I mean you've got quite a high level but when I was your level I had 16k credits to spend for example which is more than enough to get everything, if you also keep playing and get the arcade lootboxes.

Every event since the rework of the lootboxes, I had to get about 30-50 boxes to get everything from last and this year which is about 30-50h roughly over 3 weeks. This equals about 2-3h per day and if I spend credits too I'll usually hit that ""only duplicates"" after about two weeks of an event.

This event I am extremely unlucky but so far I pulled the Bastion skin and Zarya emot and have about 8k credits left after about 23 lootboxes (played about 20h over the last 7 days).

It's so disheartening to farm for hours on end, see the gold circle pop out, get super excited then it's like ""oh 500 currency"" or ""oh a skin from the base game"". With how rare legendary drops are 500 for coins seems like too little to give out.


imo legendary coins during events > non-event legendaries. at least the coins can go towards a valuable purchase.",12/19/2017 10:48 AM,"{""id"":""207591083377"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207576341911"",""name"":""tpfang56""}}",post-18,289 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/tpfang56-1858,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000F00.png,1 to 1.5 hour to get 1 loot box,1000

I can get one in 45 minutes of qp. Most times qp is stupid af that you can hard carry games. But it fluctuates to an hour sometimes.

That is the fastest I can do though, not sure if more can be done in custom or arcade.


There's no way you can get 1 in 45 minutes. Well, I never played in a group, so I'm not sure. But when I solo.. It is always 1 hour to 1.5 hour to get one. A 20-25+ minutes comp game usually give 3-5k exp. Let's say 5k. Then you need 4 rounds of 20-25+ minutes comp game. That's already way over an hour. (not counting queue time)

Well I did say I can get it with 45 minutes of quick play. Competitive it's nearly impossible to get a loot box in that time. On a bad day I'll get a box in 2 hours, with leavers delaying games.

Then how about releasing more purple skins?
You know..
The semi affordable ones?

Not just another dump of 5-10 legendaries nobody has the money for.

Or how about some actual non-timegated skins for a change, we've gotten how many by now?
I know reinhardt got one or so, but they can't total more than a couple.

I'm dead. Another day of 4-5 hrs of farming got 0 legendary. There really needs a way to farm this crap without spending so much energy in. Like in some MMO game, I could farm while watching tv.. but this? I have to actually play or I get reported and banned. yes i'm complaining. I'm tired of spending money every season to get the skins and emotes I want.

I don't have the time to play everyday, and 8 hrs a day. At most I can get is 1 or 2 legendary skin farming at 2-4 hrs a day till end of event. This is by experience from past events. I feel like the event should be for ppl that actually put in hours to get. Not luck :( Is not like we can trade skins and emotes? Why should it based on luck. There is no value in them, cuz u cant trade. It only discourage the ppl that got unlucky to continue playing. If we put in the hours, we should get at least 1 legendary in 5 hours of playing.

"These changes to Symmetra and how shield health works in the game would be amazing to test on the PTR to see how they play out, plz Blizzard, try and make Symmetra more flexible and viable, like what these changes would do.
Turrets:
1: Turret damage reduced from 30 per second to 15 per second
2: Turret range increased from 10 to 15 meters
3: Turret placing distance increased from 5 to 10 meters
4: Turret casting time decreased from 1.4 seconds to 1 second
5: Movement speed during turret casting time increased by 25%
6: Each turret now has 30 shield health (see change to shield health below)
Photon Barrier:
1: Symmetra Photon Barrier health reduced from 1025 HP to 800 HP
2: Additional Barrier added to shield to provide more protection
3: Symmetra can now choose to either toss her Photon barrier out like she does now, or place it on the ground instead
Energy Ball (Secondary Fire):
1: Charge time reduced from 2 seconds to 1.8 seconds
Shield Gen/Teleporter:
1: Ally players can now see Shield Gen/ Teleporter through walls
2: Shield Gen/ Teleporter now make no noise (call outs regarding the ultimate are the same)
3: Shield Gen/Teleporter have a brighter shield bar than normal that regen's at 20 health per second (stronger version of shield health change implemented below)

"With the recent bug fixes that Doomfist got, I see him more and more in competitive. But, it seems to me that my DPS teammates have forgotten how to counter this fisting annoyance (even if they are his alleged counters).

So, most of the time I have a choice: stay healer and be fisted all of the time or play Sombra. But, there are times when I am solo healing and I can’t really switch to Sombra and let my team have 0 healers.

My question is: how can I deal with Doomfist while I’m playing healers (and Symmetra)?

Until now, I successfully dealt with him only as Zen, if he is relatively far away from me (out of fisting range) and Symmetra (but only if I have my turrets backing me up). Sure, I know that he can be slept, but I have yet to successfully kill Doomfist with Ana after that.

"Well with Mercy, listen to adio qeues when he's charging up his fist and GA away before he attacks (takes a bit of practice).
Same with Moira, you can bait the RP with fade if you time it right and you can usually get him to retreat if you throw a dmg orb and damage him a bit. With her, you can stay out of range for most of his abilities.
Ana is difficult. You can sleep him but don't try to solo him afterwards (RP will be off CD again). I'd say just use the time he's asleep to get away, try to get to a tank which can body block or absorb his RP or uppercut.
Zen is risky, you need to hit your headshots reliably, otherwise you are dead.

However, Mercy you can bait his abilities and if you attack him from range, he has to close the gap and that lets you have a short period of time to fire at him and get him low.
Zen, discord him and do the same.
Ana has her sleep dart and bio grenade which are useful, I'd say, in ensuring she can stay alive.
Moira can bait his abilities well, as well as using her orbs to either damage DF or heal herself.

Her ultimate (shield generator) should add +50 health shield (instead of 75 currently) but to everything :

-Her allies
-What their allies are summoning

More precisely :

-Sym Turrets got +50 shield generator (not OP as it seem : check heroes damage such Winston, Moira orb, Biotic grenade etc.).

-Torbjorn turret

-Orisa Protective barrier & Supercharger

-Winston Barrier Projector

-Mei Ice Wall

-WM Venom Mine

"According to most, the roles are meant to tell how you should play a hero and if they suit the playstyle you want. However, some heroes like Symmetra and Sombra could fall into multiple categories, and heroes like Hanzo and Junkrat can work on attack despite being defense heroes. I think that slightly reworked categories could more accurately pin what a hero's playstyle is and their role.

There could still be 4 categories, but it's instead divided into:
Assault/Offense: Role is to do damage, get picks, and storm the objective. Includes most of the same heroes in offense like Tracer, Reaper, etc., but also a couple added in like Hanzo and Junkrat.
Support: Role is to ""support"" the team by guarding objectives and assisting allies. Includes builders, defense heroes, and other back-line heroes, like Sombra, Symmetra, Mei, etc.

not sure if there is a dedicated section to discuss this kind of stuff, but I had this idea in mind since a while, and when I saw the Luc hero prototype it just came back.

In short, my idea was a character able to ""resurrect"" the enemies instead of the allies: they will behave as a kind of ""Zombie AI"" for the duration of the re-spawn time of the player, and then they'll decay.

It's a sort of ""spawn minions"" kind of ability that I think we all wants, but plus it helps to mitigate and counter the Mercy's rez.

The problem with this is that then what happens if you kill someone who is under half health. You can get some 49% of their life gone, get the final blow and then someone else gets the credit. It sounds good the way you phrased it, sure, but in an actual match you could get a triple kill with an ultimate and no credit for any of them. How is that any more fair than what we currently have?

Aren't there a number of maps which certain heros excel on? Like a couple of the Lijiang maps are really good for Pharah/Lucio. Illios Well is pretty good for Pharah/Lucio/Roadhog and Orisa. Blizzard World is going to be pretty good for Widow and Hanzo. Some heroes are just really good on certain maps, it's not just a thing in Chateau.

This is a cool idea. Though it would make heroes like Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat stronger there, as they could set up traps to earn them points from anywhere on the map.

Also, how would the points be dished out. Like, the heat you get from a kill gives you points. So a max of 100 points per kill, first to 2000?

or would it be based on the actual health you took out from someone.

"Let me preface this discussion with this. This discussion is based purely on a mechanical and game play context... Hanzo's pick rate or role in the current meta are irrelevant for this thread thank you.


Scatter arrow was clearly intended to be an Area of effect ability to deal moderate damage to multiple targets but unfortunately it has been abused to be an absurd one shot kill mechanism effectively becoming a ranged super shotgun on a mid range archer hero. What are the issues with this?

1) It dissuades heroes that should be countering hanzo to play effectively at their intended purpose. Nothing worse then seeing a flanker who should be wrecking a hanzo hanging too far back get one shot.

2) Its completely counter intuitive to basic fps design. Imagine your new to overwatch you haven't read any guides or how to play videos etc its your first game. You pick hanzo because his aesthetic and concept appeal to you and someone watching you play says ""Hey cool your playing hanzo. Wanna know how to one shot people?"" Immediately you reply ""Yea hit in em in the head"" and this stranger laughs and says ""no.. shoot the ground in front of them."" Wait what? I should intentionally miss to instantly kill someone?

3) Hanzo is a defense hero but not quite a sniper (missing proper magnification) so he needs better area denial. Just being a person in an area with potentially powerful single shots does not make you a defense hero. The one thing that makes Hanzo feel like a sniper is that the damage drop off is non existent and that given proper accuracy he can one hit kill a majority of the roster.

So I propose the following ideas for a rework that will make scatter arrow reflect its intended purpose and solve the 3 issues above.

1) Scatter arrow now can only hit a single hero with a maximum amount of projectiles.

2) Scatter arrows cool down is slightly reduced for each unique target hit by scatter arrow. (turrets and mines included)

3) Scatter arrow now has a slight homing effect within a radius of its impact to facilitate hitting multiple people in open spaces.

4) Adjust the cooldown timer/damage of projectiles to compensate for said change. Scatter arrow should still produce more damage to a single target if potential AOE opportunities do not present themselves often enough but only with proper accurate shots. If you miss the shot you don't one shot a player because luck.

So these changes will accomplish the following:

1) No more ridiculously deflating one shots by your opponent missing with an ability fixing the unintuitive design via poor game mechanics.

2) A chance to reward players who use the ability for its intended purpose and a buff to hanzo's area denial and aoe damage more reflecting his role of a defense hero.",12/19/2017 11:30 AM,"{""id"":""207590282591"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""184500163664"",""name"":""Minerva""}}",post-1,2389 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Minerva-1533,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008C3.png,The rework scatter arrow needs,1000
"Time to make him a viable at least in a slightest. Why junkrat gets so much love and hanzo keeps being crap for years. We need to make his regular bodyshots do like 200 damage. It's projectile hero and his projectile is non-aoe. You can never hit heads reliably on a moving target. So his sniping just makes no sense. But if we do his regular shots kill, we can also rework his scatter arrow that people still complain about. Think about it, what's the reason to pick hanzo over a pharah right now, her rockets hit splash, and she's hard to hit herself. Any hitscan is better than hanzo, because is so much easier to aim and hit on a hitscan reliably. Snipers are underpowered in this game. Why in cs sniper is viable? Because he doesn't need to hit pixel headshot, he just needs to hit his target once. Still team usually has only single awp with max of 2 sometimes.

Many already have for a long time. Or something quite similar if not better.
You will not make it fair this way. You can either give hanzo mobility, give his arrows splash damage or hitscan lol.

"ATTENTION THIS IS LONG AND DETAILED POST ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH SMURF ACCOUNTS IN COMPETITIVE], If you don't like reading long posts, then maybe this isn't for you, the whole point of this post is to shed light on this ongoing problem in competitive overwatch]

Now before I speak on this matter, this post is not calling out people who actually try to win on their smurfs, this post is about calling out the people who carelessly throw on their smurf accounts whenever they please.

Why is smurfing a problem? What's wrong with Smurfing? Questions like these may pop up in your mind as you are reading this post.

I'll tell you why smurfing is a problem, because people feel like they can throw away games on a smurf whenever they please, because it's not their main account or it's one of many smurf accounts they own.

This creates an unbalance of competitive games and sr, this also creates a ripple effect that in turn tilts people the next match, especially people who continuously try their luck again and again hoping that they don't have another thrower, toxic person on their team, or just a loss in general the next match.

This kinda explains why people throw so much (aside from just being a disruptive player) in competitive mode.

The reason I say kinda, because I know this isn't the whole issue with throwers in competitive.

But I think it's at least half.

Most of the throwers I've encountered are just smurfs for the most part. I'd find this out by looking at their profile and noticing that they are level 30-300 in mid-high diamond and have only played one or two competitive seasons, and only have a couple of hours played for each season. Something along the lines of 3 or 5 hours playtime max. Or sometimes people would just straight up say ""I don't really feel like trying anymore, this is my smurf account so I don't care if we lose"" or something like that.

Now it may be easy to see some holes in my previous statement because of the whole placements thing where you can get placed at mid-high diamond if you do well on them. So let me provide a better example, a level 45 player is a platinum in S4, in S5 they are a Grandmaster but they have fallen to diamond. See what I mean?

Now I know it is possible for some people to just pick up a game and quickly get a grasp of it, but let me tell you when I first started playing Overwatch competitive in Season 3 I was no pro right away, I had to really learn this game in order to get where I am now. But maybe that's just me.

2 things I would like to add to my argument before I wrap this up. I can tell most of the people that smurf end up in somewhere in diamond, because I see so many bronze borders or just pretty much blank borders with little to no development on them. Also this kinds explains why the reporting system feels like it doesn't work most of the time, someone can throw on one account and go do it on another.

In closing this is a complicated subject to discuss, I tried to explain this to the best of my ability and just my experience with throwers in general.

I think this problem can be solved by only allowing one or two Overwatch accounts on a single ip or just a single account, for both PC and Console.

Yes I know on Console it would be a little trickier to do because people can create multiple Playstation acccounts for Overwatch, but I think the reduced toxicity will be worth it in the long run.

Now I ask 2 two things of you, the reader.

Please don't get upset with my statement about only allowing one or two Overwatch accounts on a single ip. Yes I know you bought the game and you feel like you have the right to own as many Overwatch accounts as you want, but do you really need 3 or 5 accounts to play on? Isn't one or two enough?

Also please help me shed some light on this topic, because I feel like if this is brought to the Overwatch Team's Attention this will be a start of getting rid of toxicity over the course of time.",12/19/2017 09:44 AM,"{""id"":""207591183166"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":7,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207509919385"",""name"":""BattleAx""}}",post-1,607 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/BattleAx-11594,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001403.png,Smurfing Has Become A Problem In Overwatch Competitive,1000

"The other day I needed the last game for Master.

I searched for a Ranked match and found one on Hanamura.
Each team had 5 Masters and 1 Diamond (4/5 of those were low level smurfs).

As soon as the Setup time starts, I start getting harassed in voice chat.
""Oh poor Koru, little Diamond... would be so bad if you'd lose your game for Master.""
""Koru is going to carry us, right? I'm damn sure he is.""
And on and on.

I just ignored everybody and thought I would play as I normally would, but I got tilted and couldn't concentrate.

So my team mates switch from a Dive comp, to Mei, Torb (building turrets in spawn), Hanzo and Widow, no healer and were laughing so hard as they purposefully threw the match just to leave me in Diamond.

Jokes on them, I eventually got Master anyway after two games, but damn I felt so frustrated and powerless that match, and seeing all that toxicity, I honestly thought at some point that Diamond in the end wasn't so bad.",12/19/2017 11:02 AM,"{""id"":""207591681752"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207454281874"",""name"":""ƘǾRU""}}",post-5,73 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/%C6%98%C7%BERU-2527,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001401.png,Smurfing Has Become A Problem In Overwatch Competitive,1000

Not true. I think there should be some balance of power when playing a hero that doesn't require aim. Currently you can jump in as Junkrat and do really well with very little practice. Same with Mercy, Symetra, and Moira (sp). You can do really well without once having to worry about whether or not you're actually looking at the target. (hyperbole again, relax!)

"Lawbreakers says hello.. at least it would, if it hit the wall as hard as it did. It's a huge example of ""hardcore shooting, no gimmickry here"" completely flopping.

Face the facts, OW has a lot going on for good and/or ill,but it bridged the gap by allowing hitscan aim-intensive heroes, with other characters relying on positioning or negligence from the enemy to thrive.

If aiming with a mouse is the paramount of skill, then outplay those ""no-aim"" types. Don't cry about the kits being ""too good"", stomp those chumps. Or demand nerfs instead of outskilling your opponent.

Remember when you actually had to play skilled heroes like Tracer, Widow, McCree and Soldier to be rewarded?
No, because Tanks and Healers always existed in this game, and you didn't need to be an MLG Hitscan Pro to play any of them. A few DPS classes who don't fit your idea of ""skilled"" slipping into the meta doesn't change the fact that there have been hundreds of players in high ranks who wouldn't pass your ""skill check"" either, and they've been there since launch; they've just been shielding you and healing you.

If you wanted a game to be ENTIRELY about mechanical skill, Overwatch has literally n.e.v.e.r. been the game for you, period.",12/19/2017 05:00 AM,"{""id"":""207590382881"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207418898522"",""name"":""Result""}}",post-17,3995 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Result-11444,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000159C.png,Is Blizz trying to make OW a low skill game?,1000

"I'm on the fence with this one. I get that this is an FPS hybrid and so it's not all about aim, and for that reason I totally respect players who use characters that need to utilise positioning and game sense more than tracking, like Sym or Winston. Got no problem whatsoever with those characters and their primary fire.

I do have a slight worry though, I don't like spam at all. Something about it just irritates me, it almost feels like you are just punting, even if it's a calculated punt it's still hoping to get lucky, and I just don't like that or think it should be rewarded. Junkrat is obviously the epitome of this but I also find myself getting a bit tilted by Moira's damage orbs sometimes, just feels very chancy and irritating to die to (play as Tracer so the orbs can be a real nuisance when thrown down a choke). I'm actually trying to change my mindset though, because thinking this way makes me tilt and play worse.

"1. Play Moira.

2. Attack any ""invincibly-placed"" object with a damage orb (Translocator, Biotic Field, Barriers or Shields, even another Biotic Orb, and Ice Wall of both friendlies and enemies).

3. Watch how it will try to attack those items and slow down instead of ignoring them like last time. This minor stealth nerf impairs the very purpose of the orb - damaging enemies. This means that if there is a reinhardt on the enemy team (or even your team) and an orb is thrown, all that will need to be done is put up a shield to completely burn it out with little damage to enemy team mates. The same goes with Mei's ice wall, both friendly and enemy objects will burn out the orb.

The problem is that since the orb prioritizes barriers and objects over players now, all the enemy has to do is place any one of these objects down to completely negate the damage orb affects.

So just something that has been catching steam as of late. Thoughts? A good nerfing? Bad nerfing? Will this bug change your gameplay of the hero? Post in the comments below!

She has had bug after bug on the PTR, but people still think these changes are intended? Doubt this was intended in any way.

It's kind of ironic that Blizzard's most balanced launch hero has also been one of their buggiest. We get the best and worst of Blizzard game design wrapped up in one hero.

"First time posting anything about bugs or the like.

Personally a little conflicted. When Moira First came out i got excited seeing a hero who could trivally disarm Symmetra's turret (Sym is actually one of my mains). When she was released and i found out I couldn't do that it made me a bit sad.

This also was strange to me when i realized my ""Evil hand"" on Moira wasn't able to target Torb's Turret and i ended up died before I realized.

So these most recent changes addressed those two issues. What came off to me as a bit of a downside was seeing how this most recent change impacted the biotic orb though especially with shield tanks. Rein, Winston & Orisa have become measurably much harder to fight since the change/bug came into play.

Additionally those same heroes also make it much more difficult to use the biotic orb to try and hurt the intended prey of Moira low HP targets like mercy, Lucio, Ana, Tracer, Genji, Hanzo ect. who are fairly known for hiding behind those barriers becasue i might get lucky and with a well placed shot I see the orb only do 50 damage despite the whole thing bouncing into a room.

I feel Moira is a VERY enjoyable hero and i personally love her I really hope that this auto lock on undesirable targets is fixed but I could almost see Blizzard keeping the changes but it really will pull a lot of my love of the hero as she felt about perfect till this change.

if having her orb not interact with turrets is acceptable I'd prefer to revert to that change than have the orb get mitigated by shields and items because it just incentives her healing orb instead which is already very strong int he first place.

This change hasn't stopped me from playing Moira in comp atm but it means Biotic orb isn't used unless I am a 1v1 or no shield scenario and I might be able to finish off my foes.

I think if blizzard was to make these changes official then I would still play her for sure but would like to ask the biotic orb replenish her healing meter slightly to offset the mitigation/ effectiveness drop off.

Either way i'm very interested to see what they do with this as Moira has been my main this season so far and I don't plan to stop till I see a reason to.",12/19/2017 11:09 AM,"{""id"":""207591581639"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""186147217594"",""name"":""Zombiebait""}}",post-23,9 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Zombiebait-1679,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C7F.png,Steath Nerfing of Moira Breaks Biotic Orbs,1000

You didn't deserve this tragic end.

I've talked many bad things about you when you killed me many times, but a few months ago I discovered a true reality behind your character. You were lonely and your lack of power made people not playing as you, and I wanted to give you some love by trying to play as you, or helping a friendly Symmetra. Not a Symmetra main, but I tried to support them.

I've loved each skin you had.
A very beautiful woman.
The Vishkar Indian Princess.

But the last patch came.
Now you die very easily. Your counters counter you more than ever, your turrets are more weak than ever, and your teleporter and shield gens are more killable than ever.

Blizzard never adressed you. You just passed away.

My heart goes to Vishkar Corporation and all Symmetra mains who fought for a perfect society, by protecting people with their armor shields, and shortening distances using teleporters.

The game creators just let her die.

"1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.
sombra translocator is really clunky because if you put it in a bad place, you have to wait 19 seconds until you can place a new one, or you're forced to tp to it for a new one, which is very frustrating when playing sombra. letting her cancel translocator will make her feel much more smooth.
bonus: unlocks a new distraction strat for sombra- throwing at enemies trans to distract them while your team sets up, and sombra can cancel it and get it after 1 second. before, the strat wasn't good because you had to wait for a full 19 sec to use it again.

2. 20 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

3. damage threshold for cancelling stealth and hack- 20 damage. while stealth and hack should be cancellable by damage, every little point of damage cancels it currently, even one point of damage from a random d.va bullet 100 meters away.
giving it a threshold will require enemies to be in their effective range in order to cancel it.

4. reduce the delay of entering stealth to 0.15 seconds. while I do understand the delay of exiting stealth, there shouldn't be a delay for entering stealth. the delay of entering stealth makes the ability too situational- you can only use stealth while you're hidden from the enemy- you need to be stealthy in order to use a stealth ability, which sounds strange to me. every other stealth ability in any other game is instant, even moira's fade is instant, only sombra requires a delay, which is kind of annoying.

5. translocator travel speed increased by 25%. the current travel speed is a bit too slow. making it faster will make her feel better to play.

6. hacked players now have a big sugar skull above them that displays the duration of the hack, while making the hacks more visible.
hacked enemies now have purple particle effects around them, while teammates have red around them (for some reason it's the opposite on live). hacked enemies will be way more visible now.

7. movement speed increased to 6 meters per second instead of the standard 5.5. this will put her a bit more in line with the other flankers (genji and tracer).
part of the problem with sombra's fighting is that she has no in-fight mobility to close distances, like genji and tracer can. while she's not supposed to be a full on flanker dps, this will make her better at fighting.

8. spread reduced by 5%- sombra's spread is too large currently, but any higher decrease in spread will focus her too much on killing, while she is a dps hero, people forget that part of her gameplay is a calculated tactician, that has advanced strats and is hard to play, she's not supposed to pop behing the enemy and murder them all, that's not the intention that blizzard has for her, and I agree on that part.

feels short because you place it 9000 meters away from enemies making it impossible for the majority of the cast to counter it.

1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.
sombra translocator is really clunky because if you put it in a bad place, you have to wait 19 seconds until you can place a new one, or you're forced to tp to it for a new one, which is very frustrating when playing sombra. letting her cancel translocator will make her feel much more smooth.
bonus: unlocks a new distraction strat for sombra- throwing at enemies trans to distract them while your team sets up, and sombra can cancel it and get it after 1 second. before, the strat wasn't good because you had to wait for a full 19 sec to use it again.

2. 25 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

3. damage threshold for cancelling stealth and hack- 20 damage. while stealth and hack should be cancellable by damage, every little point of damage cancels it currently, even one point of damage from a random d.va bullet 100 meters away.
giving it a threshold will require enemies to be in their effective range in order to cancel it.

4. reduce the delay of entering stealth to 0.15 seconds. while I do understand the delay of exiting stealth, there shouldn't be a delay for entering stealth. the delay of entering stealth makes the ability too situational- you can only use stealth while you're hidden from the enemy- you need to be stealthy in order to use a stealth ability, which sounds strange to me. every other stealth ability in any other game is instant, even moira's fade is instant, only sombra requires a delay, which is kind of annoying.

5. translocator travel speed increased by 25%. the current travel speed is a bit too slow. making it faster will make her feel better to play.

6. hacked players now have a big sugar skull above them that displays the duration of the hack, while making the hacks more visible.
hacked enemies now have purple particle effects around them, while teammates have red around them (for some reason it's the opposite on live). hacked enemies will be way more visible now.

7. movement speed increased to 6 meters per second instead of the standard 5.5. this will put her a bit more in line with the other flankers (genji and tracer).
part of the problem with sombra's fighting is that she has no in-fight mobility to close distances, like genji and tracer can. while she's not supposed to be a full on flanker dps, this will make her better at fighting.

8. spread reduced by 5%- sombra's spread is too large currently, but any higher decrease in spread will focus her too much on killing, while she is a dps hero, people forget that part of her gameplay is a calculated tactician, that has advanced strats and is hard to play, she's not supposed to pop behing the enemy and murder them all, that's not the intention that blizzard has for her, and I agree on that part.

If anybody noticed it, those changes focus around making sombra less clunky, which is the major problem with her currently.
hopefully sombra gets some of these changes in the future, she does need some attention from the devs...


So you want to be rewarded for messing up your trans? in that case i guess i want widow grapple to reset if i dont like where it latches on to :D
Thats not my intention... currently any other escape ability is instant, doesn't require any setup, and available all the time (except cd, sombra has a cd too).
sombra's trans is not like this though, it requires setup, if you didn't set it up it's far from instant, and when set up, it has a limited time that it can be used. If you didn't notice, no other mobility or escape ability has that much downsides, while trans is technically one of the best escapes, the limits on it are too harsh.",12/18/2017 03:42 PM,"{""id"":""207590182245"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-9,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

1. sombra can cancel her translocator by holding down the secondary weapon button for 0.75 seconds. when canceled, translocator goes on a 1 second cooldown.

means characters that wait for you to translocate can no longer counter you and makes junkrat's trap useless

2. 25 sec duration on translocator- the duration on translocator often feels very short and limits sombra a lot. making the duration longer will let her play more freely.

feels short because you place it 9000 meters away from enemies making it impossible for the majority of the cast to counter it. The balancing factor to this is that you have a very short window to do work. Your buff removes this balance.
sombra can't know if someone actually found her translocator, unless she was near it when the enemy was there, then obviously she isn't going to tp to it anyway. you are wrong about the trap though, this is not the only use it has, it's one of the way more minor ones, junkrat's main priority should not be searching for her trans to place a trap on it. and will you say it isn't fair that it disappears after a short duration, making the junkrat trap placed there useless?
your arguments counter eachother... about the trans duration I already answered about it to someone else.
If you're placing the trans 9000 meters away from the fight, you're doing it wrong. sombra needs to be very active in order to be effective, she cannot afford placing it so far away, so she places it closer to her team, and mind you, flanking exists. also, sombra is a flanker, she plays behind the enemy team, not behind her team, she cannot appear with stealth 10 meters away from the enemy and hack them easily, she uses high ground and hidden places to hack people, and if her translocator is behind her team, she has a hard time getting there in almost all maps unless she runs through the stairs for a bunch of time after waisting a ton more time to get from 9000 meters away (like you said), and until she hacks someone her trans is down, even with the increased duration. I don't know how you play her, but that's not a proper sombra play, maybe that's why a lot of people think sombra is complete F tier...",12/18/2017 03:54 PM,"{""id"":""207590681686"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-10,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

"As a Sombra main I really like the things in your opening post. It is more or less exactly hwo I feel too.
While I can understand the intentions and situations behind it, I'm not so sure if a spread decrease or the option to cancel the translocator is really needed.

What I would really like to see for Christmas is
5 translocator travel speed - always feels hilarious when you see how good old Ana can throw a nade and then compare it to how our young mexican friend is throwing the translocator

6 Better visual effects for hacked enemies!!!! MUST HAVE since release!!!!!

7 Speed buff - makes totally sense that she gets the same speed like the other flankers. It fits the character, the lore and cinematic, the playstyle, ...

"You can remedy most of what you're asking for just through practice.

1. Failing a translocator is simply down to the player. Essentially this buff is dumbing down a skillful component of your kit.

2. 15 seconds is more than enough time to get a lot done. This simply depends on where you're leaving your translocator and what your positioning is like.

3. Again dependent on positioning. Make sure to assess the situation before hacking/stealthing.

4. Can be completely mitigated through the throw,stealth,teleport combo. Arguably one of the most important things to know as a Sombra player.

5,6 and 7. Sure decent buffs.

1. if someone failed a trans, he's just going to teleport to it again and wait for the cd again. this is on of sombra's clunkiness, the cd waiting, no other character in the game has downtime because their abilities are on cd. this is to help solve the issue. if the enemy found the trans and sombra saw it she is obviously not going to tp to it, she is just going to have more cd waiting.
+if the enemy sits there for 15s to wait for sombra to trans, it's bad play, unless she has emp, but even then, the long downtime for the possibility sombra will translocate is not good. this change will go against those strategies, so players won't do stupid stuff.
2. 15 sec is nice, but as I said- the limits on trans are too harsh, 5 seconds more will not hurt her. she needs her handicaps lowered...
3. yes it depends on positioning, I know how to do it, but when you flank and a d.va shoots you 50 meters away when she comes out of spawn and cancels your hack isn't fair, the change still lets enemies cancel it with damage, but more fair for sombra. as I said, lower her handicaps
4. yes it's a combo, but trans isn't available most of the time, especially if you don't want the ability to cancel it, and when you have it you can't always waste it like that, you need it to get to high ground.
8. I can actually aim with her pretty well (after a year of practice with her...), but her spread is too large, requiering you to be too close to an enemy in order to shoot them, 5% decrease is very slight anyway, she'll still have large spread, it will just reward good aim more.",12/19/2017 10:19 AM,"{""id"":""207591183188"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-15,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,minor buffs and qol changes that will make sombra better,1000

"Hi guys.

As you can tell by my stats, my skill level is very low at the moment but I want to improve.

Overwatch is my first fps game and at first I really didn't care much about being good because I tend to play videogames sporadically when I have nothing else to do and I always end up getting bored of them quickly. This wasn't the case this time and I ended up liking it a lot and therefore, playing a lot more than I had expected, but thanks to this I developed some bad habits.

Recently some friends of mine decided to buy the pc version of the game so we could play together as a team. They're quite good players with years of experience on other fps games and I don't want to be carried by them, I want to be useful and help them win, but my lack of mechanical skill and game knowledge prevents me from doing that.

Right now I'm focusing on exploring the maps to understand how to defend/attack each one of them in a more efficient way, where to place turrets and what spots I can reach with mobility abilites to make the best use of them whenever I can. I'm also trying out heros I usually don't play to learn what their strengths and weaknesses are so I can be more flexible and to counter enemies more easily in the future (It may not seem like a lot, but I think baby steps are better than nothing.)

I'll start working on my aim once my first gaming mouse arrives because I don't want to mess with the game settings now only to change them again in a few weeks when I have it.

So... is there any tips you can give to someone who has never touched another fps game before? Thank you in advance.

Yah, I like triple DPS if there's 2 supports and 1 tank. I usually play Zen here because the best defense is offense with this kind of comp. Discord really helps a lot with the murdering, and he can help sustain someone who's a bit too far for the main healer to get to. That's only if there's a shield tank though, otherwise it's a bit dicey to pick Zen.

It is the pro's jobs to do exactly that though, they should be hitting every headshot that is humanly possible... I am just saying in this case Hanzo's max potential should theoretically be higher than Widow's or any other hero in fact.

"Hanzo effective range though is far shorter than Widow's because no matter how mechanically good you are, a delayed hit will fail a lot because of the enemies movements from the time you rleased the arrow to the time it reaches the target.

Hanzo is also far less self reliant in terms of getting away from dire situations (even less than Widow) and in a game where Tracer and Genji exist you are most likely dieing to them than killing any1.

Because it is impossible. Projectiles are unreliable in nature. Being a god of projectiles is to have 40% accuracy and 8-10% critical hits. Widow is capable of reliably killing any target in the line of sight without the possibility of a counterplay except shields and DM.

wallclimb as a passive

Hook is objectively better. Wallclimb allows you to reach interesting positions, but its capabilities are noticeably lower. Hanzo can not do trickshots with the help of wallclimb, cannot quickly change his position, can not avoid two dive tanks at once with little help from healers. With this, you could argue when the hook had 12s cd, but after the buff, this ability is absolutely superior to anything Hanzo has to offer.

The difference between Widow and Hanzo is that Widows potential is achievable, and Hanzo will always be a super risky choice.

Not only that, but we will restore full HP always by using recall, just analogously to how they removed the ability to self-damage yourself with our ""culprit hero"" in a previous patch. If we had any armor in the last 3 seconds, we will restore that as well to the maximum value we had at any point in those 3 seconds. This should enable some new strategies and allow for more diverse team compositions. Besides, Tracer and Torbjorn are friends. Didn't you read the comic?

- Tracer's bomb now has 30% larger detonation radius. Nobody asked for this, but her ultimate feels kinda weak and is easy to destroy, so a buff is in order.

While we're at it, let me buff Genji a little as well (2 buffs for him):

- Genji now has 2 dashes. Getting a kill will reset 1 dash, This gives him immediate unconditional 100 burst damage, but after all, he needs this buff, he isn't even the best DPS.

- his Dragonblade hitbox is now 30% longer. Just so that you can make sure to kill that annoying flying Mercy and have finally a true counter to Valkyrie.

it takes 12 Junkrat direct hits to get RIP tire.

"It seems to me that a lot of people have a big misconception about sombra, I'll cover some of them and why they are wrong.

1. sombra isn't a support
this is a half misconception about her, while she isn't a support, she is a dps with strong utility, but people seem to forget the part that says utility.
you can compare her to zen, in a way. both can deal high damage, have utility that is weak healing and very strong debuffs to enemies. both their ults are supportive, zen's is making his team invulnerable (to some extent), sombra does the opposite- she makes the enemy team very vulnerable.
there are 2 groups of sombra players: one that says that she is dps, the other says she is a support.
both of the groups need to understand that she is a hybrid, but leaning a bit towards dps, though still has strong utility.

2. sombra needs buffs to her dps
as a fact, she doesn't. she already does 160 dps, she doesn't need any sort of increase, the only thing she needs is a 5% reduction on spread.
It seems that people are trying to turn sombra into an easy no-brain tracer, instead of managing blinks, thay want to pop out of stealth instantly, and be able to slaughter everybody easily.
this is not blizzard's intention, and I agree on that part.
Sombra is built to have complex and advanced uses of stealth, hack and translocator, not being another but easier tracer.
if somebody wants to delve into the real potential of sombra, search in youtube fitzyishere, watch his guides and gameplay on youtube and twitch, you'll see what sombra is really capable of- far more than just killing.

3. blind pro following
this is not really a misconception about sombra, but part of the reason there is a misconception.
while pro following is good and helps your gameplay, there is also blind following, which is bad.
what is it? people doing what the pros do, without realising why they do it, or not understanding the balance of characters, their weaknesses and strengths, and their counters, just doing what they say.
heroes that they play should be the only ones who are played.
heroes are op? slap them with a nerf, doesn't really matter what is op about them.
heroes aren't used by the pros? buff them without realising what is weak about them, just give them some sort of a buff.
example: the pros say that junkrat is op (he is, to some extent. reducing his ult charge rate will balance him more). a blind folllower, that doesn't realise what makes him op, what are his strengths and weaknesses, will just pick him up, and play him because the pros say he's op, so it'll be an easy win, right?
no. the player will keep running junkrat against a pharah, that player who plays against him, does understand that pharah is a massive counter to him, and will feed over the fact that junkrat doesn't realise it, and will not switch.

that is part of the effect of not realising what is wrong with sombra.
she's an offense hero and the pros don't use her as a dps? buff her damage! (don't!)
this also affects sym, people don't realise what she can do, so they flame sym players for playing her, as they themselves, have no idea of how to use her, as the pros don't use her.
this is a problem, people have no idea about the balance of a hero, but they still try to do balance changes.

so as I said, damage is not the actual problem with sombra, the problems of sombra are:
1. she feels clunky to use, and her handicaps are too harsh, preventing her from doing her role effectively.
I made a thread regarding that problem
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760746368#post-1
2. how sombra is used as a support.
first, I want to say that there is no problem with sombra being used as a support in the pro scene. the utility part of her kit is the more complex part, and pros can utilitize it perfectly.
the problem is about how she is being used as a support, it's just farming healthpacks. while hacked healthpacks are part of her kit, I think that hacking enemies should be the main focus of her utility.
so the problem is: hacking enemies is often unrewarding. there are two changes that can change that, but you can't add them both, it'll make sombra too powerful.
1. when a hacked enemy is killed, the hack cd is reset-
this puts a big highlight on the part of rewarding good sombra play, but there are two problems with this change:
-it only buffs one of the hack uses: hacking to make an enemy vulnerable.
there are other uses to hack- denying the use of an ult at the right time, hacking enemies to see if they have ult and inform your team, cancelling a channel ability.
buffing only one of the uses has the possibilty of making the other uses useless. why hack an enemy if you can't get the reset for it? it will make the other uses worthless.
-it can become very op, being able to hack a bunch of enemies without emp has the possibility of becoming too powerful

2. when a player is hacked- the cd timers stop and he can't charge his ult, resource meters don't charge automaticaly, but moira can still charge it with attacking, genji can still get resets on dash while hacked.
this is actually a very good change for sombra: it makes all uses more powerful, it even adds another use for hacking- hacking to delay cooldowns.
this is a change that will add counters to the meta, reducing junkrat mine spam, stoping tracer from getting blinks, reduces orisa barrier spam, and much more.
this also solves another problem with hack: sometimes hack is useless because the cds of the enemy are longer than the hack duration anyway, now it will stop the cds.

to sum this up: sombra is a dps-utility hero, with complex uses to her abilities,
though what she is currently lacking isn't damage.
blizzard designed her as a weaker dps hero but with utility, she was never meant to be a full dps easy flanker hero.
her handicaps are too harsh and she feels too clunky to use, while hacking enemies is often unrewarding.
hopefully some of the changes I suggested will be added, or some other ones because sombra is currently lacking...",12/19/2017 09:42 AM,"{""id"":""207591782592"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207540775830"",""name"":""SwagMaster""}}",post-1,398 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/SwagMaster-21130,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000164F.png,HUGE misconceptions about sombra in the community,1001

This changed in the past couple of days.

Take Temple of Anubis (left room) as one of many examples, one Orb and the whole room is cleared.

Hey, everyone.

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.

We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).

We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.

Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.

Your teammates can respectfully provide their opinion and suggest using a different hero for the gameplay situation that your team is experiencing, but the final decision about which hero you want to play with is yours alone.

We built Overwatch around the concept of teamwork, and we believe the game is much more fun for everyone in a match when we’re picking heroes that contribute to the overall success of the team. At times, this means we’ll be playing our mains; other times, we should be trying to help the team by choosing heroes that round out the team’s composition. We won’t be actioning you if you only play your main, but we also don’t believe this is the ideal way to play Overwatch—especially in competitive settings.


Finally. Blizzard has finally addressed the one-trick problem. TL;DR Blizzard is saying that one-tricking is not a bannable offense, reporting someone for one-tricking is, and while the game is should be played with people swapping to round out the team, trying your best with the hero you choose is all that anyone can ask of you.

Hey, everyone.

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.

We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).

We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.

Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.

Nobody expected a response that would state that one tricking should be banned really. People just needed (and still need) explanation on the definition of ""throwing"" and what is bannable.

There are tens of situations I can give as an example with the question:""But is this not practically throwing/feeding/griefing?"" Coz nobody knows what is bannable. Yes one tricking is not bannable (that is clear) but a countered or feeding one trick that is trying his best, does that fall under that category?

Nobody finds just that a player should be banned for playing a certain hero. The problems start when they are being outplayed. I wouldnt know the answer to that either.

If your team has to change comp because the enemy is destroying and you cant because you are an OTP that wont change 100% of the time you are basically refusing to work with your team for no absolute reason besides ""i dont want to and i dont care"".

"Ana and Hanzo, buff them!

Ana and Hanzo are meant to be high-skill heroes, performing the best at high ranks and the worse at low ranks due to their high mechanical skill requirement and game awareness BUT THEY DON'T!

Ana and Hanzo actually perform worse comparatively at higher ranks. In bronze Ana has the 4th lowest winrate and Hanzo the 3rd, in GM Ana has the lowest winrate in the game and Hanzo has the 2nd.

This is a massive problem, it's not just the fact that they never have a positive winrate across all tiers of play but the fact that mastering said hero is not letting people climb.

Heroes that have high-skill ceiling's should naturally perform best at GM but if there is not enough value in their kits to justify mastering them to this extent it all becomes pointless.

Ana is one of our precious healers, she should be a lot more viable than she currently is at higher-ranks, Hanzo is precious in his own way.

The difference between Ana and most of the other healers is that she has to put way more actions per minute to have the same impact on the team as the rest of the healers (with the exception of possibly Lucio).

Ana is the third or fourth highest heals per minute healer in the game. Mercy and Moira can outheal Ana easily, while Zenyatta is often outhealed by Ana. Lucio, however, is a toss up. Depending on the comp and the map, Lucio can heal more than Ana. Not only this, Ana is the only hero that has to be near pin-point accurate to be an effective healer. So if the Ana on the team isn't the greatest of shooters, her effectiveness drops drastically.

When it comes to survivability, Ana is the second to last. Lucio has his speedboost, Moria has her fade and Mercy has her ridiculous health regeneration as well as Guardian Angel. Yes, Ana has her Sleep Dart, but considered how hard it is to land, I'd say the only healer with a worse survivability is Zenyatta.

Aside from healing, only Lucio has less of an effect on the enemy team than Ana. Mercy has her damage boost, Zenyatta has the discord orb and Moira has the damage orbs as well as a 15m range damage semi-lock-on attack. Again, Ana has to be pin-point accurate to have any effect to the enemy team. Being countered by Dive? She's countered by any shield. Whether it's D.Va or Winston diving or just Reinhardt or Orisa standing in the choke, she's rather helpless. The biggest effect Ana can have on the enemy team, however, is her Bio-Nade. Landing a big Bio-Nade can be the deciding factor in a team fight, but consider what the opportunity costs are. Zenyatta doesn't lose anything by having his discord orb up, Mercy loses on healing but can quickly switch back and Moira actually gains healing charge by using her damage orbs. Ana loses out on her only means of self-healing, she puts herself in a big disadvantage against flankers and loses on a large amount of potential healing.

So when you're saying buffing Ana makes her too powerful of a support, especially in the wake of the current Mercy meta, I don't know what you're talking about.

Zen has 150 shield that auto regens when he doesn't take damage, he has the ability to discord players and track their movements further increasing his survivability. He also has an ult that fully heals him and makes him invincible for a few secs allowing him to contest the objective or save his team from a barrage of ults, whereas ana can only stop 1 ult if she lands sleep dart and we all know how much skill is required for that.

So when Blizz said they couldn't add a PTR on console I just believed them and moved on. Then Fortnite BR came around and they became my new golden standard for patching games. They recently said they were going to test out their new aiming mechanics on PTR but then they changed their mind and decided to make it an extra game mode so console could participate. So I ask why Blizzard never put the PTR in the arcade so console players could actually not be left out in everything. Also there's no FOV slider on console and that's a problem.,12/18/2017 05:20 PM,"{""id"":""207590582098"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207458374879"",""name"":""SladesSpades""}}",post-1,31 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/SLADES%20SPADES,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001645.png,PTR on console solution,1001

Junkrat has two mines that do damage.

I love how you use this as an example, then complain when others use the same example for other characters in a fair way. ""Give everyone two of everything and its all fair""
But other than that-

We all know the translocator doesn't do any damage, and is there for mobility and confusion for the other team.
But giving Sombra two would just be confusing.
She would basically be an invisible Tracer. The idea might sound fun to play as for a little bit but eventually, she will become most likely become hated enough to be called for deletion by the fandom.
If you really want to buff Sombra I would say to listen to the person earlier

The fastest I could see it working is after you throw both you always go back to the 1st one placed such that; Button Press Tele 1 set---> Button Press Tele 2 set -----> Button Press return to Tele 1 ------> Button Press Set Tele 1 if off CD OR go to Tele 2 if on CD.

"Rather than two translocators, she should be able to cancel her translocator.

Sometimes you see it being camped, or you realize its not going to work, or you throw it wrong, or you need to get the high ground but it's already down, etc and are faced with two options. Option A is to translocate to the bad spot and start her entire process all over again, or Option B just accept you can't translocate and go about your business with an ability that is effectively one of the longest cooldowns in the entire game. It is clunky and time consuming on a kit that is already hampered by numerous other issues.

Having two translocators would fix that problem. But it would also be a bit broken because her translocator when working correctly is already one of the best movement abilities in the game. It would allow her to do broken stuff like invisible-toss-translocate behind an enemy team, EMP, and then immediately translocate out. That is stupid overpowered.

"I am begging the devs to read this..please..we desparately need a Mei rework...
Mei was my very first main and she holds a special place in my heart. I even had my first battletag called Mei because I loved her so much. Back then was dark times though, with literally every other game someone commenting how I'm satan or how they hate mei, etc. I stuck with her though, even though her kit was lackluster. Bullying got so bad though that I eventually did write in to support and they gave me a free battletag change, they were really nice. I stopped playing Mei after that...

Now it's almost 2018 and Mei is still in her exact same state at the game's launch..She is not the best at anything other than walling off a small choke after one person comes in..She's not even average at anything else..literally anyone else is a better pick over her and can do more. Need to snipe people? Pick widow or hanzo (mei's icicle has horrid falloff and is the hardest to land on people due to having two separate waiting periods) Need pure damage? literally anyone in DPS category is better. Need to contest the point during overtime? Tracer is universally better and can actually kill people consistently. All mei can do is iceblock for 4 seconds then get instantaneously focused by all 6 ppl when she pops out.

Her kit is really in need of revamping. Not tweaking numbers, but remaking or replacing skills entirely. All heroes need a reliable and consistent method of damage output. Mei does not have this. She has to rely on securing solo 1v1 kills with her freeze+icicle combo on squishies to be of any use to the team damage/kill-wise. Do not even think about using icicles for a whole game, they are the hardest projectile to land in the game. I have nearly 80 hours on her and still miss 80% of my icicles, they're just too inconsistent with a chargeup period that can't be held like hanzo's arrows but fire instantly after charging, air-travel period, and falloff damage.

Her ultimate can be escaped by 75% of the cast extremely easily, meanwhile zarya's grav just got buffed to prevent this, so why doesn't mei's joke of an ult get the same treatment?

After all this, she still has bugs that are unaddressed. Literally yesterday I played her and had hope that 'Ill do good with her, I will actually get some gold medals this time!', and got that silly hope in my heart like I do from time to time that she will actually be good in a fight, and we were pushing the final objective and I was lined up to save the day with a blizzard and threw my blizzard towards the point and.........
it disappeared. It literally disappeared into another void. There were no pitfalls in this level and even myself and another person on enemy team both stopped and was like 'wtf whered it go?' in match chat. If youre determined to make mei keep her mediocre and broken kit, at least fix the bugs so it functions like it says.

This is my final plea for Mei's life, Blizzard. She is an amazing character and I love Mei-Ling Zhou, but something's gotta change to her kit, I can pick literally anyone else and do more for my team quite easily.

Well, I've experienced some new (and strange) ways people might be toxic in your games. In fact, it's worse than that: a way that you might look as the toxic one.

Last night, a person decided to pretend to be me on the chat a bit before the game started. How he did it? Well, I suppose he just typed a normal sentence and went for a [Name-of-his-target:] or he just hacked somehow.

The worst part: most people bought his ""prank"" and really thought that I was throwing/trolling the game.

"Let's assume that all heroes are currently balanced. What could a hero stand to lose in order to gain more power in another area and be in a better place overall?

I think Ana's heal block could be reduced in power, maybe reducing healing by 75% instead of totally blocking it, in exchange for a shorter Sleep Dart cooldown. Sleep Dart is her only real means of defending herself, but it's incredibly hard to land and has a lot more uses than just self-defense. Ana is expected to have it in her pocket when she gets jumped on, when the enemy uses an ult she can cancel, to set up kills for her teammates, or save teammates from abilities like Roadhog's hook. Her grenade would still be really powerful, but Ana would be a lot safer.

Or another hero, Symmetra. Reducing the health of her Photon Barrier in order to also reduce its cooldown would help Symmetra out a lot. The barrier is virtually never destroyed by an enemy. 1000 HP is too much to burn through before it hits a wall, so the enemy just lets it drift away. Its primary use is to block line of sight and block burst damage, which a weaker barrier could do just as easily.

She's a 200HP squishy with low DPS, she's not at risk of face tanking anything.

Uninterruptible hack is exactly that and she can actually ""tank"" a fair bit on a health pack.

Thing is, besides it being completely counter to her play-style, hack isn't a solo ability. It may be worse than shooting in a pure 1v1, but it disables those abilities against her entire team, not just Sombra herself.

I really don't understand why you are so focused on this. Yes a headshot is way harder to pull off than a hack. Sombra can stealth behind enemy lines while Widow can't.

She needs her spread decreased, her stealth to be more stealthy and maybe even have her hack time reduced. Something along those lines. But you should still be able to interrupt her hack. She has her ultimate for easy instant hacks already.

You act like we all disagree that Sombra needs help. This is just not the best way to go about it.
Because shooting is already better than Hacking under most circumstances. Improving her SMG therefore makes Hack worse again and risks making it even more redundant. Hack is where she needs improving.

tip1: not everyone enjoys playing DPS and I had games where I had to fill as DPS before (normally these games start to happen from Masters onwards)

Many people enjoy Mercys playstyle, many don't. That's just the reality of it.

Step 1: go into competitive
Step 2: be the last to pick
Step 3: take a look at what's missing. Maybe a teammate will even be kind enough to suggest it

I'm just nitpicking but sadly, if you play to win, the ""27 unique heroes"" becomes ""5 or 6, but usually Mercy if you fill""

"Let me start off by saying I believe both these heroes definitely need some kind of buff as they are 2 of the lowest pick rate heroes in the game at the moment.

Now, for Mei, I honestly don't know what I would do to improve her. She is fun to play in quick play but feels pretty useless in comp (I could be wrong, but I don't have a ton of time on her)

For Sombra, I don't think her spread should be adjusted as mentioned in the post above mine. People argue that her spread should be reduced to do more damage but if you can track your enemy well Sombra actually does a fair amount of damage. Instead, decrease reload time to get that extra bit of damage if you really need it before you translocate out.

I do agree that there should be a sugar skull on hacked enemies to point it out to teammates. I like the idea of a hack threshold but I feel it might be too OP.

I also really like the idea of having her hack reset after confirming an elimination like Genji's dash.",12/19/2017 07:31 AM,"{""id"":""207590382984"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207522397220"",""name"":""MACHINE""}}",post-3,15 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/MACHINE-12531,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001401.png,Mei and Sombra buff idea,1001

"My friend just got silenced for 47 days from multiple reports. Seeing how toxic this game can be getting reports from all sources like when you're losing, hero choice, abusive words, communication or enemy team upset at ya. It comes down to the point why even bother banning when the cycle continues? I've seen my friend get upset when ally teammates starts ridiculing. I gave advice saying just turn off all communication, but then what is the point when you're still going to get reported?

There is no way out of this mess like this game is report frenzy zone no matter how light or strong it is. You'll get ban no matter how much you love or hate it. The reason I play this game less and haven't touched it much as my friend is because of these stuff. This game brings nothing, but the worst out of people and the developer staff promotes instead of trying to solve the problem. I heard bans are done by a automated system which gives a user whether innocent or guilty a hard time to appeal.

I know nothing can do be done about this, but check out the report if it's legit or not. False reports are toxic and seeing how innocent players who can get trigger by a troll's trap means this game promote toxic instead retaliating. Ban those who make the false reports the ones who starts the problem. The ones who play devil's advocate.

I already know my friend isn't innocent and my friend doesn't own a mic sadly. However I don't think even staying quiet won't help much when players just start getting trigger over anything. This is why I play this game less now because of how my friend gets baited easily which leads to report zone act 1, but at the same time still willing to support the team. I don't know why when it's easier to quit.

...She's far and away the most difficult support and yet has the lowest win-rate out of ALL heroes in Grand-master (where she should be excelling) and the second lowest preforming support (Lucio) is 6 ranks up and has an almost 4% higher winrate, I think you can make your own conclusions.

Her damage is still 10 lower than it was, speed boost was completely removed from Nano, her nade was already nerfed once, she has zero self-heal, no mobility or positioning tools, the most meta tanks counter her hard, and again, she takes infinite amounts of skill compared to the other supports.

Why is it so difficult for people to understand how completely removing or invalidating something is a bad design choice?

If you played her you’d know why the anti-heal is fine as it is instead of calling for unreasonable nerfs.

sombra’s hack or emp can completely invalidate some ultimates once they’re started. is that bad game design?
mccree’s flashbang and roadhog’s hook can do the same as well.

zenyatta and lucio’s ults can invalidate soldier and genji’s ultimates on top of others I’m sure. is that bad game design?

dva’s dm can eat all hitscan and projectiles, so she can just straight up delete things from the game. is that bad game design?

It's not absolutely blocking, there actually is counter play (recall, zarya bubbles, shadowstep, etc.)

It's super powerful for sure, but one of the only things that makes Ana playable. If you nerfed this, you'd have to give her very large buffs elsewhere.


50% healing reduction is powerful enough. If you can't kill someone who's being healed by only 50% then I don't know what to tell you.


You have to take it in context with the rest of her kit. It makes a huge difference in 1v1s like hog. 50% takes it from a 1v1 you can sometimes win to one you lose every time. Similar story with the lucio 1v1 (normally in your favor, would now likely be lucio favor), the 76 1v1, and in a bunch of other situations.

She's already at the very edge between playable and leaving the meta. This is a massive nerf which will push her well over that edge. She already struggles to keep up in healing with mercy and moira, her advantage is her utility. If you lessen her utility, there's no reason to play her over moira.

And it does matter that you don't play her. You don't understand her match ups and you don't have a sense for what it's like playing the hero.",12/19/2017 07:32 AM,"{""id"":""207591681659"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207511154047"",""name"":""VPLewboski""}}",post-25,635 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/Cato%20the%20Wise,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008E8.png,Ana's Biotic Grenade healing block,1001

"Can't win the lotto if you don't buy a ticket lol. For real though, probably not working is not throwing. It's grasping as straws, it's desparate, it's a gamble, it's questionable, it's a lot of things, but it's not throwing.

As for the OPs example, if the player picked Sym out of spite/anger because they knew they would suck and it would hurt the game, and proceeded to suck and hurt the game? Yeah, it's throwing. If they happen to be angry, pick Sym, and then try their hardest to win? Even if they still suck and hurt the game? That's not throwing. It's dumb maybe, but not throwing.

It kind of depends really. Did they play Sym for a bit, realize the pick was out of anger and switch? Did they play Sym the whole time, and do alright? Did they play Sym, put her turrets in right places, spam her orbs in the right chokes, etc, but still just didn't cut it? You can't determine if they are throwing without the entire story.

I honestly don't know if this is a popular opinion or not, but I think most would have to agree that waiting an entire year for these special modes to come around is quite annoying and pretty unnecessary.

I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, because I love this game to death aside from issues of toxicity and whatnot, but the game is pretty low on the content department and there isn't a whole lot to keep both casual and the more competitive players interested for extended periods of time.

Hence, I think that keeping these modes permanent would grant more overall longevity to the game. Wether it would be in the custom modes, or part of the weekly brawl rotation, it'd be a really awesome Christmas present for sure!

Oh, and on a side note, keeping competitive Lúcioball permanent (although separate from standard comp) would be a real game changer, as it would allow the more casual players to get a taste of the competitive feel without being too burdened as well as having the more competitive minded players the ability to try something new or different, the possibilities are endless.",12/19/2017 06:04 AM,"{""id"":""207591182995"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207515778971"",""name"":""Crossfade""}}",post-1,55 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/xbl/steelerssuck12,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000009E1.png,Should seasonal event modes be permanent?,1001

I just wanna play uprising again and having to wait a year feels like BS. They should rotate season events weekly in the arcade.

Hello, please understand I only mean to ask.

I'll try and keep this short, but I think you all deserve the context in which I'm coming from. I'm not intending to sound like a whiner, or thinks I'm better than I am. I truly just want to explain and hope there's a light at the end of the tunnel. With the recent changes to competitive I would like to have my story heard.

I currently am a platinum player in competitive. I have been gold and stayed in plat on the verge of diamond. However the season I have a problem with is Season 2,

Now I know what you would say just get another account, however I love my items I've worked hard for, I would be happy to if I know it's the only way but you don't know if you don't ask.

So please blizzard help me by just letting me know what to do.

Thanks for the game and the experience I have had.

??? Bruhh moira literally has the lowest primary dps... bruh seriously... no one is disagreeing that Moira has insane levels of range but that s literally the trade off of her very smol 50dps...

Bruhhh moira literally has a 200 damage orb + right click + self heal leeching + a better dash than tracer

Bruhhhhh I literally saw a moira walk into a full health reinhardt and he died in 2 seconds. Bruhhhhhhhhhhh i played Tracer on a koth map and both Moiras beat me to the point bruhhhhhh!! ??????

Do the math, a moira solo killing a rein at full health is impossible in two seconds. Moira's primary does 50 damage per second. Moira's orb does 50 damage too. So at max potential, Moira's highest possible damage output (without outside interference like being Damage Boosted, etc.) is 100dps. It'll take the her 5 solid seconds to kill Rein with his 500 overall health. 5 seconds, theoretically. And that's without considering the slight damage reduction Rein has from his initial 200armor. Nor does it consider the fact that theres a high chance of Moira's orb leaving the 5m radius that it tethers to damage Rein. Nor the fact that her orbs will only deal a max damage of 200, meaning at best if tethers it self solely to Rein and deals 200 damage to Rein for 4 seconds and that Moira is also using secondary fire on Rein for that 4 seconds to shave off 400 of Reins HP (again calculations neglecting the minor damage reduction from Armor type hp). After that 4 seconds Rein will still have 100hp and Moira, having only secondary fire to deal damage, would take 2 seconds to finish him off. So at best it would take Moira 6 seconds to solo kill a Rein. So your statement of a Moira solo killing Rein in 2seconds is nigh impossible.

Moira's Fade apparently has a speed of 18.75m/s with a duration of .8, giving Moira a maximum range of movement during Fade of 15m. After Fade, Moira has a base speed of 5.5m/s that she'll have to make do for 6seconds while Fade is in cooldown.

Tracer's Blink moves her 7.5meters into the direction she wants practically immediately. This ability has a 3 second CD. Outside of abilities Tracer has a base movement speed of 6m/s.

So let's recap. Moira has a 15m dash at a 6second CD, Tracer has a 7.5m dash at 3seconds CD. In these values both Moita and Tracer has the same speed. But Moira's dash isn't as instantaneous as Tracer's, in fact as I've said Fade has a duration of .8 seconds. So effectively, in these of abilities it takes Tracer 6seconds (in terms of ability CD) to move 15m. While Moira can move 15m every 6.8 seconds. That .8 seconds stacks up over time so Tracer moves faster than Moira in terms of Fade vs Blink.

Not only this, Tracer has a higher movement speed. Let's take the 6s CD (the gap it takes between Moira's Fade and Tracer to have two charges of Blink, which allows both to move 15m not considering the .8 difference due to Moira's fade duration) again for example. During that 6seconds Tracer would be able to move 36m while Moira is able to travel 33m. So again Tracer is obviously faster.

But wait, there's more. Tracer has a whooping 3 charges of Blink at the start of the match. Giving her a total burst dash of 22.5m at the start of the match. That's 7.5 more than Moira's initial dash.

So basically, Tracer is very much able to reach the point on a KotH map, where both spawns are equally distant from the point, against Moira. The difference is that Tracer would often save her Blink charges after the inital 3 bursts, while Moira has to use her Fade every 6seconds to put it on CD. This gameplay differences are a not a fault of Moira's kit.

In recap or TL;DR
You first point is bogus as it will take Moira to solo kill a Rein roughly 6seconds not 2 seconds like you claimed.

And your second point is situational. Tracer is faster and is very much able to reach the first point in a KotH map before Moira.

So, bruhhh, do the math.

Bruh...

Edit: bruh, my dude, she does 50 damage per second. It literally takes her 4 seconds to kill a 200hp hero. Bruh... you had 4 seconds to get out to find cover, get a health pack, find your healer, hide behind a tank, anything really. Her hp is 200, you can literally just 2 shot her... bruh...


At eichenwalde at the first point I was at the ceiling with pharah AND SHE COULD STILL HIT ME!!! There aint much cover in the sky and I think its kinda bs that you can attach a damage dealing attack to a pharah at that hight all her mobity is focussed on staying in the air and avoiding attacks.

> Complains about a hero who has 20meter range ticklebeam that cannot pass barriers and can be LOS'ed
> Plays a hero who can fly and has no falloff rockets which means infinite range and less ways of LOS'ing rockets doing 120dmg per direct hit and 80dmg huge splash

Think pharah players lately are just super salty that there is now a hero who doesn't need gm level aim in order to hit them lol. Even if it's just with a ticklebeam.

Just beg for a mercy pocket why don't you if you have so much problems with a single support hero.


GM level aim to hit a Pharah hahahaha funny.",12/19/2017 07:33 AM,"{""id"":""207591782523"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207573387531"",""name"":""TortleTurtle""}}",post-34,4 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/TortleTurtle-2362,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000012D4.png,Moira's range...,1001
"I had originally posted this as a reply to a thread regarding widow noire, but it didn't get much attention. I think it deserves some.

ORIGINAL POST
I have a very unpopular opinion, but as someone who did nexus challenges from the first oni genji i was quite disappointed when the same thing came back because people protested not being able to get it. And then, if two times wasn't enough, it was added to loot boxes. And then (don't get me wrong here i'm ok with this) duplicates stopped being a thing so if you open enough boxes you'll find the skin.

So oni genji, which since last january i felt so proud of owning, became a regular skin. Ok. But at least do a promotion for widow noire or something! I know, you'll say that I was lucky to get oni genji for free a good 4 months before everyone else, but people with widow noire got the game BEFORE ANYONE and got rewarded with a skin. If they released it now, even just for game of the year (although I bought origins before it was game of the year so don't try that WELL PEOPLE WHO PREORDERED DIDNT KNOW IT WOULD BE A SUCCESS), people would have it a year and a half before everyone else. I'm pretty salty about being on the losing side for oni genji (i also got officer dva through the nexus challenges but it's not as important a skin) and widow noire.

Sorry for all this wall of text, but I feel everything i wrote is significant and can't be summarised. I know i'll receive dislikes, you just have to name the noire skin to get dozens, but i don't care. This is my opinion, and nobody will ever change it.",12/19/2017 07:23 AM,"{""id"":""207592579202"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207416904609"",""name"":""Markar""}}",post-1,503 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Markar-2254,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000008C1.png,Another VERY unpopular opinion,1001

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season

""During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January.

It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.""",12/19/2017 07:26 AM,"{""id"":""207590482416"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207529923708"",""name"":""Terx2""}}",post-9,801 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Terx2-1856,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001321.png,Beachrat,1002

One of these things is not like the other, one of these things doesn't need to aim damage.

Symmetra is really good at punishing.

Bad aim? Punished by a gun that does not require aim
Bad position? Punished by close range power
Bad priority? Well that charge 3 gun is pretty intense if you leave Symmetra unchecked.

Symmetra starts with a measily 7.5 damage per instance, and 4 instances per second (30dps)
Soldier can deal 38 damage with one headshot, and iirc deals 8 instances per second?

Sym also has a very very short range (7-9.5 meters) and most heroes have the mobility to escape that.

Bottom line, Symmetra only really gets kills by punishing poor play. Which is a good design for a support hero whos main objective is not geting kills, its mitigating damage to allies.

Even if you don't have the greatest aim, it's not hard to just stay away from her. Nobody runs up to reinhardt with no fear (unless he's already weak, or if you're reaper/junkrat)

Sombra? Whatever. I agree she could also use some buffs, but i dont think she is in as bad a place as sym right now, sym is very easily countered. Sombra isn't extremely counterable, she's just relatively less effective compared to other options",12/19/2017 07:07 AM,"{""id"":""207591481852"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":5,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207533699587"",""name"":""Creati""}}",post-4,493 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Creati-11923,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C3F.png,Symmetra & Sombra have 3 things in common,1002

That's true, you start to notice the completely opposite differences, like
- how you pointed out - Symmetra works with no coordination, Sombra works with heavy coordination.

You get praised for killing streak as a Sombra, you still get toxic slurs with Symmetra.

>take genjis small sword or what ever it's called, lets just call it a sword.
>stretch your arm out as far as possible, hold the sword so the tip is away from you
>woah? do you see how far that sword is a way from your body?

that's how genjis hitbox works. The animation and visual effects are COMPLETELY OFF from the hitbox so it seems ""big""

yes genjis deflect is getting a nerf where if the hitbox goes through a wall, it can't deflect. That's great.

Deflect isn't even OP or huge. I am currently a hard stuck diamond player and I can't tell you how many times I deflect at a good time just to have the enemy player look at me like ""okay..."" it's not difficult to stop shooting a deflect, it's loud, the visual effects show that he's deflecting. so there is NO REASON for you to shoot anywhere at genji, or anything around him. It takes 5 minutes of playing against a genji to see the size of his hitbox and memorize it's size.

about 95% of the players who complain about genji are in a low rank
and yes i am bringing up the rank argument because the lower rank you are the less game sense you have, the less aim you have, the less reaction you have and it's a simple fact.

I played genji at my friends house (he's in silver) and i can't tell you how many people literally shoot at my deflect at a point blank period. If I tried that in diamond nothing would happen, deflect is only good to break shields when everyone is spraying (enemy side) and deflect is good for a surprise deflect like on a widow or mccree flash. But if genji deflects and YOU are still shooting him then clearly it's your fault, not his ""hitbox""

""but if i shoot genji from the back it deflects to the front""
yeah that can be changed i don't see why it should shoot at the front of him but if you're shooting genjis sides, the deflcet should stop further damage or velocity if it hits his deflect from the back (makes sense)

""but genji can cancel deflect with shift and it's unexpected""
well if a genji is in a dashing distance and you are at a low HP then it's actually extremely predictable that he is about to dash at you and it's your reaction that is going to get you saved or not

""genji is OP, over loaded kit, too OP""
well that genji that's kicking your butt is going to climb out of your current rank and go to a rank he belongs in.

If you don't play genji in competitive (this does NOT include quickplay, arcade, custom games) you can't say he's OP. You need to play him in comp to actually get his real strength and weakness. If you're crying about genji and you have like 30 minutes on him in comp then you clearly never played genji. You clearly never experienced how difficult his kit can be and how annoying it is to get countered a lot. Don't say something is OP if you never played it competitively.

""GenJi Has 2 CouNTers""
no he doesn't, he has a few counters and when he gets hard countered It's extremely annoying to play genji (this is coming from a genji main)

One game I played had a winston (i was a genji) and my team told me ""swap off genji they got a winston"" i said ""im not swapping unless hes countering me""
btw, that winston never jumped on me once while I was wrecking their team. If a winston catches you off guard (dash on cooldown) you're pretty much dead.

""stoopid genji main just doesnt want his main nerfed""
lol idc if genji gets nerfed, idc if any of my mains get nerfed. There is 26 heroes and I can main any of them. i mained doomfist and I was all with the hitbox nerf and his rocket punch nerf but really these ""nerf genji"" threads are insane ""nerf double jump"" ""remove dash reset on kill"" lol??? just simple troll threads that will change. Yall remembered the mass nerf doomfist threads? now it's genji and nerf genji threads are actually dying, it's becoming nerf junkrat threads. You know the nerf junkrat threads only started to appear after like 2 months of junkrats buff lol. People just started to play junkrat more and started to realize his actual strengths. not many people were even mentioning his double bomb as OP, just junkrat itself was ""OP"" it's because not many people were playing him and when ever a hero gets a rework/buff more people play them and realize how good junkrat actually is. what if symettra got a normal buff and you started to see her A LOT in your games and then you're going to see ""nerf sym"" threads talking about how her beam is super OP and how her turrets are OP. this forum is a joke honestly.

why does everyone play genji?
hes a fun hero, he has a fun kit, he has high mobility, requires high reaction speed, hence why i started to play him.

but in all honestly, stop crying over a hero you never played competitively with then people will actually start taking your ""nerf genji"" threads seriously.

"Deflect hitbox is ridiculous and broken and it should not be that big, even if you're not shooting at him he still Deflects it. Deflect hitbox should match Genji size and not the size of a tank. Plus he has too many advantages like double jump hides his critbox, double jump makes it easier for him to land headshots, forces u to wait out Deflect even if there's other people shooting at u because if u try to shoot at them he Deflects it, and there is no way to dodge his dash. I can confirm that it takes little skill for Genji to kill u but it takes HIGH skill for u to kill

"QUICK MAFS

The shortest length of a Wakizashi is 30cm

Genji's height is 5'7 which converted to metric is 174cm

Let's assume Mercy knew basic proportions when rebuilding Genji

In that case his wingspan should also be 174cm

From some of Genji's official designs, I'm going to estimate his torso takes up 2/7 of this wingspan

(174÷7)x2=50cm (torso) (174-50)÷2=62cm per arm, so with his sword he has 92cm of reach.

If u don't believe me, watch these videos even his ult hitbox is ridiculous too

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-91CXd6vCsU


>Take genjis arm
>photoshop it so his arm is pointing 90 degrees
>photoshop his small sword in his arm
>his hitbox range

that's exactly how his hitbox works. I've already seen those videos and his hitbox looks fine to me, the only issue is that the animation and visual effects are completely off from his hitbox which should be fixed.


Of course you think it's fine, you're Genji. Anything wrong with him is good, anything bad needs to be fixed or we riot.

Secondly, who cares if it's anatomically correct for his range, it's broken for a video game. Heck, we got robots and people shooting some magical beams that heal and crap. For the game, he has a completely broken hitbox on it. It requires no skill to jump in front of an already shooting target and deflect everything back at them.

thirdly, you can stop shooting him and think you have a clear shot on another target and BAM, shot yourself for some stupid reason.",12/19/2017 06:54 AM,"{""id"":""207590982307"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""184563541828"",""name"":""TooLateNow""}}",post-17,2753 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/TooLateNow-1933,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001153.png,GenJi DeFleCt HiT BoX Is ToO BiG,1002

His deflect hitbox is the same size as doomfists rocket punch when he was first released.

There is a forum post with a lot of video evidence of this.

Not to mention if he is behind a hero you are shooting and he deflects, you can die. Makes sense right?
Fortunately that can be avoided altogether by not intentionally shooting at (or around in some cases?) a deflecting Genji. I don't think there were many precautions to Doomfist's truck sized one shot fist.


how can you avoid it if he’s deflecting behind you lmao. the hitbox stretches well beyond the animation, expecting people to just stop shooting in the general vicinity of him is outrageous. you could be aiming at someone next to him and he’ll still be able to deflect it.

just give us a better/more accurate a visual indication of the hitbox or nerf it, idc which one.",12/19/2017 07:01 AM,"{""id"":""207592381992"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207519477502"",""name"":""issh0man""}}",post-19,2806 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/issh0man-1306,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D58.png,GenJi DeFleCt HiT BoX Is ToO BiG,1002

if he's deflecting behind you then it's your teams fault that they are shooting him. It's really common in gold that people shoot genjis deflect and or around genji all the time.
""expecting people to stop shooting in the general area"" the area isn't that big or to imagine his hitbox size. This is probably what's stopping you from climbing out of gold. Try to deflect in low diamond - top 500 they will just stop shooting at genji in general. It's only what, 2 seconds to stop shooting around him?

""you could be aiming at someone next to him and he’ll still be able to deflect it.""
so look how far genji is from the enemy. do you need to question if his hitbox is near the person? then dont shoot him. if you dont need to question it then shoot him. It's literally common sense, I don't know how hard it is to figure that out. It only took me 10 minutes of playing against a genji to realize the animation and visual effects didnt match his hitbox and it only took me 3 minutes to figure out not to shoot around him. YOu can do the same.

If that's your mind set then you can easily climb out.

Do you understand the concepts of positioning, zoning, pressuring, body-blocking, peeling, etc. that are all relatively less tangible than something like ""Damage done""?

Stats only matter within context. If you are excelling and helping your team win games in ways that are not accounted for in the specific stats that influence your SR than you're being punished for not stat padding.

Why create an incentive that baits people into playing worse so they can hedge their bets on the SR system treating them favorably?

Why do people think individual performance based gain/loss is bad? I see no downside to keeping it. You should be judged on how you play, not on how you team collectively plays.
Do you understand the concepts of positioning, zoning, pressuring, body-blocking, peeling, etc. that are all relatively less tangible than something like ""Damage done""?

Stats only matter within context. If you are excelling and helping your team win games in ways that are not accounted for in the specific stats that influence your SR than you're being punished for not stat padding.

Why create an incentive that baits people into playing worse so they can hedge their bets on the SR system treating them favorably?

If you're having a net positive effect on your matches that will show up in your W/L given time.

It will hopefully get rid of the 20 point gains, 40 point losses. All in all I think it will be a good thing.


Perhaps I was mistaken, but I thought that was because of MMR.
I think both factor in, but if you consistently play and place in mid diamond for example and had a particularly bad game the losses in sr could be ridiculously harsh. That I think has more to do with the personal performance than mmr.",12/18/2017 08:59 PM,"{""id"":""207591381342"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207452182968"",""name"":""ShadowHunter""}}",post-9,204 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Cross_Nomad,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000015AE.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

That guy would eventually just drop out of your rank because there is a good chance he isn't winning that many games. At first it might suck but they are all going to trickle out of the super high ranks after a while.
You would hope so, but the fact that throwers are even in higher ranks at all indicates for sure they aren't necessarily throwing all the time. The particular game I mentioned was in mid-high Diamond, on the Xbox. My point focuses on the specific game you're in where someone else happens to be throwing, and minimizing the losses you take from that game. It doesn't matter what rank you're in (or what platform you're on), you can always run into someone who's going to throw.",12/19/2017 07:00 AM,"{""id"":""207590782758"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207430680585"",""name"":""MofoMan2000""}}",post-10,4120 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/MofoMan2000-1452,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000C79.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

Edit: Yes, downvote me without answering my question. I don't have a bad opinion, I have an ignorant opinion. Downvoting won't change my opinion, answering my question will.


The reason is that the system is flawed. There's some inherent bug in it, due to how it was designed, comparing peoples performance specifically based on the character they play rather than their performance relative to the people in the game they're currently in.

I'll admit i like it too, because it motivates people to not give up, which you see in other games CONSTANTLY (LoL), but even though they fixed the character I was concerned about, it's probably for the best they dropped the system they have.

Currently I'm feeling like i'm getting too much elo now on Soldier. I was getting royally screwed for 2 seasons, now i'm getting too much and it doesn't feel fair. This eases my conscience now that i've noticed it probably being overtuned that I don't have to go around making posts to the devs because they're already a solution in the works.",12/19/2017 07:08 AM,"{""id"":""207592579198"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207422285238"",""name"":""Dolphin""}}",post-13,1729 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Dolphin-12537,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000009EB.png,My only problem with removing Performance Based SR,1002

I'm a girl that loves playing ana. I like to help my team out and I play ana well. But I keep getting flamed to play mercy bc she's ""so much better.""

In a way my team is right mercy offers so much right now. This makes me sad.

This is a competitive game after all and typically the team that can play better win.

I don't think is all her fault junkrat makes it impossible to heal tanks and his tire always kills me.

I hate that other heros have to get nerfed for others to be good but this is all really unfair

I got crapton of SR playing ana once i got like +40 SR from carrying the game where i had like 2 deaths and 50+ offensive assist. Like i said if you play ana incorrectly you'll have super high healing but low damage, low offensive assist, low defensive assist, low elimination and most likely low sleep dart target.

Thus is the reason why you have low SR gain. You boast one stats and has every other thing a low as possible.

It's not because of golden weapons that I play comp, it's a plus, but not the reason. I like trying, apparently you don't. Giving them to QP just makes them super prevalent and since there's nothing to lose in QP people will just grind them their because it doesn't even account for skill so a smurf group can just crush games for them.",12/19/2017 06:58 AM,"{""id"":""207592579191"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207468489387"",""name"":""Terranguard""}}",post-2,9904 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Terranguard-11978,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000005F8.png,Remove Golden gun from comp,1002

"Sometimes you can deny a lot more damage by shining your matrix where it'll be going, rather than where it's coming from. For example, if a friendly Pharah uses her ult, you can be pretty sure several enemies are going to start shooting at her. It's almost impossible to be in a position to block all the shots from their source, but you can cover Pharah directly.

That's probably the easiest example, but being aware of any time a teammate is about to be focused down is what D.va is best used for, and no other tank is nearly as effective at this play style.

"Its pretty clear that compared to the ""healthy"" healers (lucio Zenyatta ana) Moira provides the most stable high volume Healing AND Damage. Additionally for no reason at all her Orbs have high utility capable of penetrating shields and clearing poor underpowered Symmetra's turret nests with no risk or skill.

The Orbs should either have narrower effective ranges or be slowed down by shields to mitigate that only 2 characters(genji and diva) can stop Moira's orbs both of whom were considered top tier without being necessary to counter the new Super healer.

basically this is paraphrasing but jeff said in an interview that players wont get banned for playing a specific hero, and he said that in a general sense, so one can assume that even if say someone who mostly plays supports decides to i dont know pick hanzo with a 14% win rate in a high diamond game, jeff will say, nope not throwing wont even consider it, which is a dangerous precedent, as you may have noticed since this announcement comp games have gotten worse, and worse, so far tonight every single game has had a thrower
it dosen't matter if you never played a hero before, if you have an abyssmal win rate, if you just like playing a hero a certain way(flanking hammer attack torbjorn, or maybe dps only zen), no matter what jeff says its not throwing and blizzard will refuse to take action. but its ok because he politely encourages you to play with ur team :P Well now we know his stance i guess we can stop impulsively reporting our attack torb with 10 minutes on torb , i mean hes just playing a hero you can pick in the game, and as jeff said totally acceptable!

You have an account on which you literally play 3 heroes, all DPS, only DPS and call on others for picking heroes you don't like 'throwers'? Where's the time you spend in other roles? Where's the time on Junkrat or Pharah to bring some different kind of DPS?

But alt accounts come from a portion of players who are discouraged to try out heroes they don't play in comp because their teammates would report and be toxic to the mercy main playing Mccree. Dollar signs would make more sense to make playing underplayed or low winnate heroes bannable so that these players would make more alt accounts to play only the heroes they get reported for playing.

If you switch to a hero to try something else because you're on for a loss anyway, then that hero is going to end up with a poor win rate. I don't throw at all, but I have some pretty poor win rates on Sombra, Ana, Reaper, because I've only really used them to try to turn things around; that I win anything on them is more a demonstration of it sometimes working out, when I'm only playing them from what is a losing position anyway.

Yes, you can't read minds.

Throwing on an off meta character is the same as throwing on a main character.

If you think they are switching off to throw, and then precede to throw, report them and it'll be justified.

If they get into an argument and objectively start to throw on their main character, then report them and it'll be justified.

If they get into an argument and switch onto an off meta hero and are still trying, but you don't like they switched to a hero that doesn't fit the comp or is just a hero you don't like, then reporting them would not be justified.",12/18/2017 11:46 AM,"{""id"":""207591781391"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207418979317"",""name"":""Fatfatty""}}",post-19,631 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Fatfatty-11970,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000013FE.png,Interview: throwers will never be banned,1002

There is an argument that the rest of the people should swap heroes to counterpick the counters but, wouldn't it be easier to swap one hero instead of several? Also if multipile people swap to accomodate a hero that overall doesn't have much carry potential does it even matter?

I do think it’s respectful to people to be willing to gel with the team composition, but you can’t ban somebody - it’s not a bannable offence - for just playing one hero, as long as you’re trying your best to win with that hero.

Who makes that call? I've literally been told I'm being countered on Widow, when I've had zero deaths, all the damage, all the kills, because their supposed counters weren't getting to and weren't bothering trying. Someone was just having a hard time and decided it was my fault.

Then there's the number of times I've seen Tracers not getting close, or Pharahs being taken out constantly by 76 and McCree, but not a word is said about their being countered.

Alternately, I'm on Mercy and getting countered, so I do switch, and suddenly that's the worst thing in the world.

It's a really nebulous argument, and too much of a meme to default to, to take seriously. It doesn't really mean anything anymore.

The rules are clear enough. Tightening them any further just leaves them open to too much abuse from 'fun police'. The report system is being abused as it is, and it doesn't need this extra step.

Being bad is not throwing. Trying to win on a hero you don't like is not throwing.

Intentionally losing is throwing.

Now, I was thinking thread might be about how people on suspensions and bans could still play by way of using alt accounts, and therefore not really being banned. That would make more sense. But, seems that's actually what you're doing anyway...


hey guess what playing a hero you suck at in comp is throwing

there's 26 heroes to choose from,and their is quickplay for practice as well as several hero specific practice games in the custom browsers

there is no excuse to play your worst hero in comp unless you are purposely trying to piss of your team

the whole point of COMPETITIVE is to bring your A game by picking a character you are horrible with you are basically throwing because you know full well you will not be contributing enough

the same goes for picking a hero that is constantly dying before being able to do a thing.

and when I say horrible I mean you literally can't kill anything or defend properly",12/18/2017 12:16 PM,"{""id"":""207592480427"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207416906802"",""name"":""Shadow426""}}",post-28,755 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Shadow426-1393,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022CD.png,Interview: throwers will never be banned,1002

There is an argument that the rest of the people should swap heroes to counterpick the counters but, wouldn't it be easier to swap one hero instead of several? Also if multipile people swap to accomodate a hero that overall doesn't have much carry potential does it even matter?


Team dynamic is a complex subject, and we must also remember that there are also characters who counter a whole category of heroes. If the enemy picks one to several tankbusters, you're either switching off tanks altogether, picking a tank with a completely different dynamic than the one you're using to get countered less, and then you might wreck all the synergies you were having with your team, or you can ask for help from your teammates, who are naturally more able to deal with tankbusters than you are.

Before Moira and the Mercy rework, when Dive was prevalent, there were some times when the enemy flankers were so oppressive than even Mercy couldn't properly avoid them, and then the options to switch were either ""pick Ana and get countered more, or pick an off-heal that might not defend himself properly either, but also sucks at healing, or switch off healer altogether and let them have fun"".

Since Moira is everywhere, Genji is less of a problem, and Winstons actually don't over-extend in comp as much as they do in QP to chase Widows, because it's hard and leaves your team exposed; I have more problems against Orisa's barriers and her suppressive fire.


This is why ""switch, you're being countered"" has become the equivalent of a mosquito in my ear. Instead of relying on the easy scapegoat, you need to ask yourself and your teammates what's going wrong and move on from there.

The game doesn't have some hard and fast rock-paper-scissors design where the moment you pick a hero's counter, they lose. It encourages and rewards prioritizing hero picks for their synergy, but the foundation of a strong team is teamwork and communication.

I had a match on Hollywood defense where my team's comp was pretty par for the course. The enemy team had a top 500 Symmetra. We all knew he was going to pick Symmetra. My team thought we had it in the bag, started trash talking, and I knew exactly how it was going to turn out.

They came to the point with no tank hero. The Symmetra was their tank.

We got rolled. My team tilted pretty hard and just fell apart. Our DPS started trickling and switching to everything they could hoping to kill him. Meanwhile, their team moved as a unit and crushed whoever got in the way. Whenever they wiped with a lucky ult, they just came back immediately because no one would go get the damn teleporter.",12/18/2017 12:49 PM,"{""id"":""207590981335"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207429390782"",""name"":""Arfbix""}}",post-32,424 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Arfbix-1601,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001643.png,Interview: throwers will never be banned,1002

I think what we really need an answer for regarding competitive is whether staying on a hero despite being hard countered, as in the enemy team didn't just pick the right heroes but those people playing actually are playing them right and thus you can't get anything done, and not switching is acceptable behaviour or not.


We have an answer, the same it has always been. It's just that a certain portion of the playerbase plays dumb and reports their teammates for off-meta picks anyway. There can't possibly be a different answer anyway since ""hard countered"" doesn't have a precise definition and the only way to implement it is the current ""ban based on a number of reports"" system which seems to be pleasing nobody.",12/18/2017 12:54 PM,"{""id"":""207591680690"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207540980377"",""name"":""Matrim""}}",post-34,1297 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Matrim-2438,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000BBF.png,Interview: throwers will never be banned,1002

That’s not how win rates work , win rates take into account how much play time you have and how long the game was you played that hero in.

So lets say you have played two games this season and in the first game you only played tracer and won and that game lasted 10 minutes and in the second game you only played tracer for 1 out of 10 minutes and lost that game your win rate on tracer wont drop to 50% instead it will only drop to something like 95%(not sure if I did the math right) so what you’re saying is wrong.",12/19/2017 06:20 AM,"{""id"":""207592481410"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207558176455"",""name"":""Sinc2002""}}",post-43,10 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/AidanTheBillyBoy,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000006FB.png,Interview: throwers will never be banned,1002

These changes to Symmetra and how shield health works in the game would be amazing to test on the PTR to see how they play out, plz Blizzard, try and make Symmetra more flexible and viable, like what these changes would do.
Turrets:
1: Turret damage reduced from 30 per second to 15 per second
2: Turret range increased from 10 to 15 meters
3: Turret placing distance increased from 5 to 10 meters
4: Turret casting time decreased from 1.4 seconds to 1 second
5: Movement speed during turret casting time increased by 25%
6: Each turret now has 30 shield health (see change to shield health below)
Barrier:
1: Symmetra Photon Barrier health reduced from 1025 HP to 800 HP
2: Additional Barrier added to shield to provide more protection
3: Symmetra can now choose to either toss her Photon barrier out like she does now, or place it on the ground instead
Energy Ball (Secondary Fire):
1: Charge time reduced from 2 seconds to 1.8 seconds
Ultimate:
1: Ally players can now see Shield Gen and Teleporter through walls
2: Shield Gen and Teleporter now make no noise (call outs regarding the ultimate are the same)
3: Shield Gen/Teleporter has a brighter shield bar than normal that regen's at 20 health per second (stronger version of shield health change implemented below)

"The issue isn't that she doesn't heal, but rather that she frequently replaces the second healer on the team when run optimally, while being unable to really contribute as a frontline DPS. She can't heal the solo healer nor can she replace what they do if they go down, and no amount of damage mitigation can fix that unless it's blatantly OP. The ways in which she supports without healing are precisely why she is bad- she allows her team to make more mistakes but doesn't really help them if they do well, meaning that she will always be underpowered in the upper tiers and rather annoying in the lower ones like the rest of her kit.

Every once in awhile you get a free loot box attached to one of the current Arcade modes which is awarded if you win that mode once. It is separate from the weekly rewards, hence it having persisted for over a week.

I've played a lot of games with CTF and I have to say Overwatch's take on it is the least amount of fun I've had playing it.

Edit: While I have won CTF games, and my friend has as well, we just haven't been able to do that since he had that loot crate attached to it. We've attempted it I don't know, maybe five or six times? Most of them were draws.

If they add that, then they should remove the leave game button if you have it ticked.


As well as an automatic 10 minute suspension from all playlists if you just close your game.

Honestly though I don't get why people complain about backfill. Aside from being quick and easy XP, it's not like it happens in comp, so who cares? Sure you might have ""wasted"" a few minutes in queue for a short game, but how is that better than eliminating backfill and playing games with missing teammates the entire time?


Backfill is beyond infuriating sometimes.

It's rare but it does happen where you get:

Match Found
Defeat
New match starts
Reinstancing
Match cancelled not enough players
In queue
Match Found
Defeat
New match starts
Reinstancing
Match cancelled not enough players
In queue

And this will continue on. One night I sat in arcade for almost 40 minutes and never got to actually play a match cuz this just happened over and over and over. I eventually just shut the game off and said forget it.

At the very least, those situations need to not happen. If you get kicked from a match for not enough players, you should only be put into a new match after.

LOL, enable this and you'll never play a full round again. one person leaves, for whatever reason and now youre a 5v6 ... how soon before the next one leaves and so on ..?? i'd say just a few seconds at most, becuase everyone knows that as a 5v6, you lost. then the entire team leaves with making the one team that still has players, the uncontested winners.

Up until about 60 minutes ago I would have been all for this idea. So many times we have all joined a game to only see less than 10 seconds on the clock and half of the team waiting to respawn.

Then a little while ago I joined a match on oasis - right at the end of the first round. There was a Moira, tracer, mcree, hog and dva already - i opted for second heals and chose Lucio.

Evidently the player that left was a frustrated dps because the Moira was not healing. I pretty much solo healed the remaining two rounds to a victory - the Moira barely threw out orbs, just a lot of dps. I ended up with gold heals heals (by half way through the next round), three environmental kills, dropped a lot of beats on pushes to retake the point. The other team played really well too. I was working my fingers to the bone to keep up. Great hard team fights. We had a victory but quite a few times it was really too close to tell which way it was going to go.

Despite being backfill, it turned out to be one of my better games today.

Granted, that is NOT the norm and usually backfill is just a real crap-fest you are getting put into. But, if we had a feature to disable backfill and I had it turned on, I would have missed a great match.",12/19/2017 04:14 AM,"{""id"":""207591282557"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207468986485"",""name"":""ObjectOrient""}}",post-14,313 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/ObjectOrient-11701,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000138C.png,Never Backfill - Option,1002

"Before I inadvertently let this drift off into whiny territory, allow me to preface this by saying I love Overwatch. This isn't a post about how I'm losing faith in the game or the company- I'm not. In fact, I'm probably just overreacting to something most people would shrug off and move on. But for some reason, it has completely killed my desire to play competitively.

You see, I caught a friend of mine boosting his account recently. The 400 SR in one hour isn't what tipped the boat- no, the 51 consecutive quickplay wins is. So despite this guy being an actual acquaintance of mine, I did the right thing and reported him. And while I've accepted by now that he won't be banned (Since it's been around two weeks since the report), the fact that this went unseen and untouched is what urks me.

The downside of all of this is that, for some reason, it's had an unsettling, lasting effect on me. Every time I log on and see him inches from crawling into diamond, I lose motivation.

"Opposite thing happened to me. I have this friend who I used to play with (we were both Plat rank). We played most of our games together, but I went on vacation for about a few weeks and when I came back, he was high Masters. I couldn't believe it, sure I was happy for him, but I was bummed that I couldn't play competitive with him anymore. Then it hit me, was I holding him back?

I came to the conclusion I think I was. I'm still in Plat, and he is still in masters (although I think he has decayed because he doesn't play anymore).

So my question is: Are you sure he is getting boosted?
If he is. Don't worry so much about it. Overwatch is a fun game when you stop caring so much about rank and start thinking and working as a team player.

If there is one thing that I can say I have improved with, I'd say it's my attitude. I go into games saying, ""What tank do you guys want?"" or, ""I can Mercy if one of you wants to pick up second tank."" Also I'm quick to compliment peoples great plays.

I'm very team friendly, and as a result, I've met new friends, and great people.
My recommendation, just keep working with people and being friendly.

Unfortunately, yeah. Even though this guy has only gotten out of gold once before, I can look past the sudden boost from 2250 to 2700. That's not impossible. But I don't believe anyone can win 51 games of quickplay in a row fairly.

Also, thank you for all of your advice. I'm pretty much the same way in hero selection. I keep a positive attitude most of the time but sometimes do get a bit feisty during losing streaks. I'm only human- but this is something I'm looking to improve as well.

"Sombra has received massive buffs and changes to her kit since her release, but the problem isn't that her abilities are too weak or that she can't kill because of her spread, it's because her kit is too wide. Unlike Mei, who seems to be in the spot of a stall-only hero, Sombra has too much going for her. Her stealth and tele give her an assassin-type role, but her playstyle is poke - tele back to hacked mega - ult. Her hack makes her fulfill the role of a support, on certain maps, and as a light-CC hero (disabling a hero's abilities, whereas McCree stops the enemy entirely).

I feel like some aspects of Sombra can be cut and moved to new heros so she can have a more focused kit, and become more effective than just a poke hero who can't kill, with only EMP being her potential.

Hacking healthpacks should be cut and moved to a new support.

This is what I feel is holding her back from getting a spread reduction, as she it would only buff her poke potential (thus getting more ult change since she can deal more damage/kill). She could stealth in, get a kill on a vital target, either bring them low or outright kill them, then tele back to her hacked mega (think about how Junk's dual mine increased his ult charge rate, and I don't want that for her).

Hack now only hacks enemies, but has a 25-ish health cutoff before cancellation.

It's too easy to deny a hack, especially when the enemy is running large spread heros like Reaper or Tracer, or auto-locking ones like Winston. This cutoff would mean the hack-e can't just turn around and shoot 1 pellet to deny a hack, and this could actually turn her into a Tracer/Genji counter as she can shut down their movement abilities, and without taking .01 damage and canceling the hack.

Movement speed while her passive is revealing an enemy.

This way she can get to low-hp enemies quicker and give it slightly more utility. Yes, is higher up games it can be used as a callout tool (""the enemy Mercy is low"") but is a cripple to her in lower tiers where communication is bad, or nonexistent at times. This would buff her independence. Plus she could receive more ult charge the longer the enemy is on critical health to compensate for her healthpack nerf.

Finally, tighter spread / more accurate startup from first shot (think Soldier or Bastion) / or somewhat of a burst-fire option.

Her gun as a lot of ammo, but it doesn't make up for the atrocious spread that sucks at any distance (Hell, Bastion's spread is kinda !@#$ in close ranges, but his RoF is what keeps him decent at his job). Since it's her only form of doing damage, outside of shields being destroyed during EMP, she can't do anything with her spread nor huge clip. Hell, I'd give her half the ammo if she gets a spread reduction, since she could actually dual and secure kills.

Translocater removed, but stealth is a resource ability (lasting 8-10 seconds).

Once again, removing her poke ability but buffs her infiltration ability. To balance this out, she would have a slight trail effect just so the keen eyes can point her out.

I feel like this would be a good trade off as she can kill more effectively then, since she no longer needs to abandon a dual. I also feel like a 25-ish hp cutoff would also help here in the same way it helps her hack.",12/19/2017 03:05 AM,"{""id"":""207591681514"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":10},""author"":{""id"":""207432212631"",""name"":""PharHǝntoi""}}",post-1,2180 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/PharH%C7%9Dntoi-1208,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022CD.png,Sombra's kit is what's holding her back,1002

If she's a DPS, she should be able to do some DPS. Right now her gun is the worst in the game, and I would be fine if she was turned into a support, but then she needs more team-oriented abilities or some form of healing aside from healthpacks (since her viability comes down to which maps have the best healthpack locations).

That just widens her kit, and she'll still be just as niche. Her healthpack control is what limits her to certain maps in pro/high tier play, and is what's stopping her from being taken as a serious DPS, as the health-tele combo is a more powerful recall ability. Tracer can't recall out of a fight unless she's blinked in, and when she does recall in the action, she stays in the action unless she blinks out. Sombra's tele is much more forgiving, and would make her a poke-assassin which would turn her into a OP monster since she can runalongside a Tracer or Genji and tag-team a target and kill them instantly.",12/19/2017 03:34 AM,"{""id"":""207590782538"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":6},""author"":{""id"":""207432212631"",""name"":""PharHǝntoi""}}",post-3,2180 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/PharH%C7%9Dntoi-1208,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022CD.png,Sombra's kit is what's holding her back,1002

And yet you wonder why her spread hasn't been increased. With lower spread you're just tacking on a kill which is more ult charge. Where have we seen a buff that directly increased ult charge? Hmm lemme dig and find that hero...

What about the Hog mains back in Hook 1.0 that pulled you around corners, even a teleporting Sombra could be dragged across the map by a hook.

then in that case they should just decrease junk's n sombra's ult charge. both ults are VERY powerful. the issue with lowering sombra's ult charge is that she gets a lot from other teammates using her health packs, not just her. this goes to show that it's actually teammates that are detrimental to sombra players, not her kit.

support is an umbrella term and healer is just a term underneath the support umbrella it's not that hard to understand lol. as long as people wouldn't replace a secondary healer with sombra she would work very well in the support role as a utility support.
she's in assault because she helps her team press the attack/assaultthe enemy team with hack/emp, but wait! it works just as good on defense! so she could also find space in the defense role, right? (this is why i say sombra's her own role lol, she's a bit of everything)

1- 6 minutes of sombra this season, so proud of ya! (also: sombra counters genji, hack n' shoot! and as a flanker you should also be able to take care of a widow. hanzo is honestly just pure luck so glhf (i'm able to take 'em out fairly easily though but that is just me))
2- if you had 15 hours i'd be saying basically all the same stuff i have been saying besides that last paragraph lol. i don't care who one mains, if they have enough playtime in another hero to know how they work they can talk about them all they want. there's exceptions to this of course (some people in high masters/gm/top 500), but this is my all around mindset for talking about heroes.
3- i try not to discuss heroes that i have less than 10/15 hours in so you can keep your hopes up! (if i do i'm most likely complaining and being a dumb whiny baby!)

Her actual weapon damage is fine (160 DPS is basically identical to 76's rifle), but most people who play Sombra know she's on a very short timer to actually do anything, between the translocator cooldown and the fact that she's a mere 200HP hero who can't self-heal without being parked on a hacked health pack.

Tracer's gun does sustained damage as well, but her sustain is better, and Genji's burst damage is better.

"The biggest problem I have with Sombra is the 15-second limit on her translocator. It's really easy to lose track of the countdown in the heat of the action and end up stranded in a situation you can't escape. And I don't think the countdown actually restricts what she can do with the translocator very much; it just increases the cognitive load on the player.

It would have to be a bumper button so players can move and talk at the same time. Maybe.... Put the left bumper (L1) ability on Y (Triangle) and the ultimate ability on right on the D-pad.

Here's what former Selfless coach said on reddit in one post:


Huge congrats to my boy Daniel. For him to play almost 400 games in just a few weeks is so like him. He was one of the hardest working players on Selfless, playing the game 14+ hours a day. During our successful run he was among the most eager on the team to do vod review. He championed an honest environment that pushed us towards progress. And he did this while never getting invited to a LAN, earning only 1700/month, and living thousands of miles from home in a dining room with only a curtain for a door.

None of the haters in this thread understand what Selfless endured trying to prove ourselves to the world, having to play $100 weeklies for 2 months and getting passed over on AMM invites while going 206-12 in scrims (maps) against all of the teams favored over us behind the scenes. My guys dedicated themselves to be the best in a game with barely an esports scene at all, and dafran was a big part of that make no !@#$ing mistake about that please. There's a reason pro players love dafran, there's a reason his Selfless brothers still love and forgive him; each of them knows a similar pain, and although they were more stable and endured better, they can all relate to how hard dafran pushed for success for so little in return.

I'm glad dafran is back, he deserves better, and having seen him when he's at the top of his game; I know for a fact he has a lot to offer both as a teammate and a person.

"Seconds was sarcasm, but

I just wen't from my initial 3781 and my high 3867 from last season to Diamond. I'm not here complaining about how awful it is, I'm here because I'm confused how I've lost 300SR and not won at least 6. I'm honestly confused. Isin't the system made to be fair and to be able to climb? I can't because of the gain and loss. You literally lose more SR than win! This should not be allowed, especially when your switching characters constantly and doing pretty well.

I don't think I'm near GM but I've PASSED Diamond though the system puts me right back into it. It's not suppose to be easy, but it can't be this absurd. Can someone answer this for me, from the team?

"In a game where most of the maps are designed with one or multiple choke points, a hero that does 120 damage per grenade and has an unlimited amount of them, is going to be extremely powerful. I come from playing over 3000 hours of Team Fortress 2, a game that has a character very similar to Junkrat: Demoman.

Demoman had two weapons: Grenade Launcher and a Sticky Bomb Launcher. His Sticky Bomb Launcher was used much like Junkrat's Mines. They were used to set up traps in corners and could be used to jump around the map. His Grenade Launcher was also used much like Junkrat's Frag Launcher. However, the difference between those two weapons is how the grenades behaved. In Team Fortress 2, the Grenade Launcher had a longer range, but the grenades turned from hit based to time based once they touched a piece of the environment. Meaning, if you did not get a direct hit onto an enemy, the grenade turned into a time bomb. On top of this, the grenades also did less damage if it wasn't a direct hit.

What if Junkrat's Frag Launcher could get a flatter trajectory, but wouldn't do the full damage if they were bounced off a wall/ground?

Junkrat's buff was completely unneeded and he needs to be nerfed. Either in damage, or his passive to not take damage from his explosives.

You clearly didnt played Junkrat when he had self dmg, having self dmg was a HUGE drawback when fighting at close distance where he was supposed to dominate

And dont bring the stupid comparison about Soldier, Zarya or Pharah

Soldier and Zarya actually take advantage of this to get on higher ground and if Pharah is dealing dmg to herself then wtf is she doing in the front of someone?",12/19/2017 01:24 AM,"{""id"":""207591481562"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":16,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207414376381"",""name"":""DarkCat""}}",post-8,3112 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Zokenay,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000002487.png,Junkrat spam acceptable?,1002

Grenade hotbox is about Australia size, so pretty everything is direct hit.

Subj: junk is ultimately low skill floor and skill ceiling char. It requires almost 0 effort and 0 training. His place is in lower tiers cuz it's designed as a char for newbies. It should be almost useless on higher ranks. Making such a faceroll char viable in gm and top 500 (actually anywhere higher than plat or even gold) - is absolutely wrong and anti-competitive.

BTW - this is a main reason why people are dropping ranked right now. Ironically OW competitive is anticompetitive now, cuz skill and effort are very poorly rewarded, especially compared to spam and faceroll.

Do you remember when they called for nerf threads to Reinhardt because he controlled the pace of the game for the first year?

I think Orisa has gotten some complaints too recently, her barrier does a pretty good job as an alternrative to Reinhardt.

So, idk, maybe the majority of the playerbase (and I really mean the majority, anything less than GM is a clown fiesta and even that's being generous) is not as good as they'd like to think they are and keep putting themselves in stupid situations where the tools to succeed have been provided but go unused. But god forbid they show some introspection and think about the details that led to their deaths, clearly the hero is just OP.

Still does ~100, which is enough to scare away any DPS and make them run for cover/heals.


So much bad information in these threads.

Junkrat's grenades deal 80 damage in a 2m explosion radius, with sharp linear dropoff that bottoms out at 12.5 damage. An actual direct hit deals 40 damage on top of a point blank explosion, for a grand total of 120 damage.

Non direct hits, assuming you're not close enough to whomever was struck to get over-the-clothes-intimate in the first place, shouldn't realistically deal more than 40-60 damage.

If you're taking more than that, you were too close.

100? Junkrat is literally incapable of dealing 100 damage in one shot.

"140 hour pre work mercy player on old account. I spent 95 hours one season only playing mercy trying to get to gold. Season 5 I decide to play ow again. I finally reached diamond after being plat for 3 seasons.

Why do I get dumped on just because this one season I decide to put majority of my hours into mercy again because I miss playing her and love the feeling of playing her?

“low skill Hero you suck mercy mains are trash” I decide to share my success of finally getting out of platinum for three seasons. I was very close to diamond two seasons ago. This season went from 2700 to 2200 flexing. Then I decided to play mercy only and Its been a long climb to 3000 solo queing only.

I’m very happy to share with everyone on here but then get told by an ignorant person “she’s the easiest character in the game and anyone can be top 500 with her”. “Hold left click and hit gm” It just doesn’t make sense if she’s so easy to play why am I not top 500? It kinda tilted me.

I like how everyone hates mercy mains BUT AS SOON THO AS SOON AS THEY DONT PLAY MERCY, THE LOW SKILL TRASH HERO, THE SAME PEOPLE THAT TALK TRASH, WHINE AND CRY FOR MERCY. The hyprocrisy is unreal.

She’s so broken right now you’re team NEEDS a mercy if the other team has a mercy. And if you have a mercy and the other team doesn’t you’re already at a great advantage over them. It just feels unfair. It feels like the Only way to win games is with a mercy. I’m sick of the abuse.

Delete mercy from the game so I don’t have to deal with this anymore. The one goal I had forever, took so long to finally achieve , I just get discouraged and dumped on. Thanks overwatch community, now I see why most of the posts on this forum are complaining about toxicity.

Two seasons ago I could solo heal as lucio against a mercy and still win. Now a days not even TWO healers against mercy will win. Blizzard just accept that you ruined mercy and caused even more toxicity towards mercy players. Thanks.

"Almost every game (Usually Quickplay) I go into I receive insults, hate speech, homophobic comments, etc. because I main mercy. People will actually go through my profile for no reason. I've had people say

""did you get boosted by the mercy rework?""
""Are you gay? You must be because you play mercy?""
""Kill yourself [edited]""
""Brainless boosted no aim trash""

Etc.

People can't accept that this isn't a purely shooter FPS, it's a class based, team based FPS where different heroes serve different roles. The last few months have ruined quickplay for me, because for over half the game I get yelled at (it's always by someone on the enemy team, though, oddly enough).

There are no ""hypocrisy"", easy hero means that no matter who you are, you can still play mercy on every rank.


“No matter who you are”

Okay then why don’t dps mains play mercy if they desperately need one so bad.

Sorry, but I’d rather not see an amazing zarya player, with one hour on mercy, play mercy in a high tier comp game. I see plenty of people play mercy for the first time in comp cuz LUL she’s so easy, and get completely dumped on.

Why don’t y’all just accept she requires some skill and isn’t some brain dead hero like everyone thinks she is? Why is it so hard to accept that.

Every dps main: “I cant play mercy I’m so bad with her”

But how I thought she’s the easiest hero in the game.

Yeah I agree she’s op, I’m sick of her being mandatory in comp games, before the rework as a merc main I was afraid of Ana she was my counter.

she’s easy to pick up but you really gotta utilize her kit for maximum effectiveness and have pretty decent game sense.

Normal legendary skins are on a completely different drop table than the event ones. When you get a ""normal"" legendary skin during an event it did not ""take the place"" of an event legendary. It's purely a bonus. During events, you have a higher percentage chance of getting legendary skins because you're pulling from the event drop table in addition to the normal drop table.

Yes. All event content is on a different drop table (sprays, voice lines, skins, animations, poses). Event content always has an event themed background when the items open up in front of you.

Normal legendary skins are on a completely different drop table than the event ones. When you get a ""normal"" legendary skin during an event it did not ""take the place"" of an event legendary. It's purely a bonus. During events, you have a higher percentage chance of getting legendary skins because you're pulling from the event drop table in addition to the normal drop table.

Also, you're guaranteed to get at least 1 event item per event loot box. Of course you can get more if you're lucky.


I'm finding it way better than that. I have most of the base game commons and purchased 50 loot boxes last Halloween. This Halloween I purchased 50 more.

My first 23 loot boxes contained no duplicates. They consistently contained 3-4 event items of different rarities. The most common occurring, non-event item drop being credits.
I earned 600 credits from drops.
I got 2 event legendarys (Ana's Corsair and Symmetra's Dragon) and 2 non-event legendarys (Widow's Comptess and Rein's Stonehardt).",10/13/2017 04:18 PM,"{""id"":""207576009140"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207410913107"",""name"":""NooneSpecial""}}",post-26,3695 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/NooneSpecial-6649,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001159.png,Normal Legendary skins shouldn't drop from Event Loot boxes,1003

Question though, how does that work?

Like, is it a top-down thing where you're rolling on both and both come up with legendaries, you'll see both legendaries and they'll replace lower-tier rolls of white or blue? And if you got a purple too, they wouldn't replace the purple unless there were no whites or blues?

Jeff,

Why are ""standard loot table"" items even in these event boxes? We can get these all year long. When people buy loot crates or play alot for them during events, the last thing they want is a ""standard"" loot item no matter what the rarity.

I for one am usually the kind of guy who spends 40-100$ each event on loot crates. Which is kind of absurd but even spending that much, I still dont get all of the new event skins. I dont mind supporting the game, I love the game and what you guys do, but I also dont love spending 100$ each event just to get the cool new skins you guys put out there. 3000 in game currency is now also nearly impossible to get to since you guys drastically reduced the duplicates we get in crates. (dont get me wrong that was a wonderful change and thank you for it) If my memory serves me correctly, when Summer Games ended, I was sitting right around 1000 currency. When this event started I had about 1900 ish currency if I am remembering right. I also have id say about 80% of all items unlocked so I even get more duplicates than the avg player since there is not much I dont have. I just think 3000 in game currency is absurd.

But more importantly, I dont think I am alone in begging you guys to remove ""standard loot table"" items from event loot boxes. Especially if we are spending our hard earned money to support you guys.

P.S. There is the ability to swap loot crates between event and regular when buying and opening. Why is this even a thing? Since everything is in the event boxes, this mechanic is pointless.

Thank you guys for all that you do, not wanting to come across as ungrateful, it just gets tiring feeling almost like you're being cheated with loot boxes.

Hello mr Kaplan,

I have a question for you. As you can probably take a look at my account at any time and get an idea of what I buy and how much I have, I was thrilled when I heard that there would be less duplicates and more new than usual. I was plagued with duplicates for the longest time and it hurt me even more when I do put some money to support you guys. Anywho! this isn't about whining, I just am interested in how your system works.

the less duplicates seems to work in the beginning but it quickly disappears to 95% duplicates after a certain threshold. so the first 10 boxes were great drops since and then it all went to duplicates.

So is there a certain point where your reach a % of owned and it turns back to duplicate mode? is there a way to balance that out to make it less painful for the ones that have a lot of items.

That said...

I still do not agree with the ""chances"" tables you have. I still feel in my guts that a normal LS (a bonus or not) should be swapped instantly with an event LS.

What I don't know if the system is choosing skins from a pool of skins we don't have or is just pure chance. So newer players will have even less chances to get LS from event LB since the skins pool will be bigger for them.

SUGGESTION: What if we ""unlock"" skins from LB... but they are not usable instantly until we click ""OK"", they are ""stored"" in the meantime. So that way we'll still have the chance to exchange a LS that we don't want for in-game money.

Ever since they reduced the likelihood I never have as much currency and when I see something I REALLY like, buying 50 boxes is no longer a guarantee that I'll have enough currency to buy it if it doesn't drop. If anything, the lack of dupes has INCREASED the gambling nature of it all since I have less opportunity to directly purchase something.

The key is to unlock everything so you only get duplicates/gold. Then buy the new skins with said gold.

Thanks for responding so quickly, also I think the Lootboxes are way better than before the changes. I bought 50 boxes and got pretty much everything except from maybe 2 or 3 skins! Which seems really fair

You spent ~$50 for a few skins and you still didn't get all of them? And you're actually satisfied? Good lord this is sad..

Seriously, I have two accounts and all loot boxes from arcade that I got (plus some others due lvling up) dropped trash and 1 normal legendary in both (A Doomfist and something else that I already forgot, characters that I don't play at all)...for god sake, the amount of time you ask to get 3k is absurd and knowing I can get normal Legendary skins from them discourage me from purchasing them at all.

I got the game last year at the end of this same event so I couldn't get any of the skins... and now probably I'll be lucky if I even get one :/


Normal legendary skins are on a completely different drop table than the event ones. When you get a ""normal"" legendary skin during an event it did not ""take the place"" of an event legendary. It's purely a bonus. During events, you have a higher percentage chance of getting legendary skins because you're pulling from the event drop table in addition to the normal drop table. Hope that clarifies things a bit.

I agree allot with what your saying here , however I'd like to tack on my own two cents along with what your saying. Jeff we get your a business most of the players playing overwatch have the money to support new content , and it's great that you can ""technically"" earn all the skins for free , however in an event which has a limited time to get said skins , I don't mind dropping an extra 30-50 for all the new event skins ""IF"" I actually get all the skins for that event. Having content added to the loot drop table is nice until you realize you don't want regular non-event content in a limited time event. It dilutes from your chances of getting a piece of event content because the loot table is larger. Save the regular content for when I play the game , keep that as an incentive for me to keep playing , if you want to make some extra cash by making more content thats fine but at least let me buy ""THAT"" content.",10/14/2017 12:49 AM,"{""id"":""207576208134"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207481082527"",""name"":""TheEqualizer""}}",post-50,1289 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/TheEqualizer-11397,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000002F7.png,Normal Legendary skins shouldn't drop from Event Loot boxes,1003

The clarification seems unnecessary, since:

1. I went on the shop and the description clearly states:
Each Halloween Loot Box contains a combination of up to four cosmetic items and/or in-game credits, including a minimum of one Halloween Terror event item.

2. The title of the thread is ""Normal Legendary skins shouldn't drop from Event Loot boxes"".
I believe, that the Original Poster didn't mean to say, that what is happening is not intended, but rather he meant to say, that you should change the Event Loot boxes, so that they drop only event stuff... so you're not addressing the actual issue.

I believe the problem for the Original Poster is coming from:

1. Him playing on two accounts instead of focusing on just one and the result is, that he doesn't have enough unlocks to make it, so that he gets mostly event items from the Event Loot boxes.
2. The new system makes repeats less likely to occur (unless you've unlocked a lot of stuff), so he can't stack up some currency prior to the event.

The result is, that he is excited for the event, opens Event Loot boxes and ends up disappointed. You might wanna consider, that on a relatively new account, this will be the likely outcome with only 1 guaranteed Event item per Event Loot box.

I get 4 every box because of the no dupe system.

Considering, that my account is 700+ and that I have unlocked all the sprays, voice lines, victory poses, non-legendary skins and icons, I get a steady stream of 30-40 currency per box at the lowest while there is no ongoing event, while during an event I get 4 event items every time... so it would be much more advantageous for me to buy Event Loot boxes on my 700+ account in order to get the few missing items from last year and earn new ones, than for the OP who is merely lvl 113...

You might wanna raise the number of guaranteed Event items per Event Loot box, or at the very least do so for Event Loot boxes purchased with real money, or you're at a risk of alienating newer players from buying boxes and supporting your game.

I was contemplating getting the blizzcon pass just for the Winston skin but was like 'that's a lot for a skin', then was like 'wait, if that was a legendary, i would spend way more then that on crates and probably wouldn't even get it!'.

Normal legendary skins are on a completely different drop table than the event ones. When you get a ""normal"" legendary skin during an event it did not ""take the place"" of an event legendary. It's purely a bonus. During events, you have a higher percentage chance of getting legendary skins because you're pulling from the event drop table in addition to the normal drop table. Hope that clarifies things a bit.


Sorry but I do not believe this, I have opened ~ 20 event boxes and have received 2 legendary drops, the torb pirate skin, and 500 gold. Sorry but if the odds of a legendary are supposed to be ~1 in 13 and odds are supposed to be higher for event skins because of a smaller loot pool this doesn't add up. Please look at my account and tell me I am wrong Jeff but event boxes should not drop non event loot, i seriously feel like i was cheated out of my money for the boxes i purchased.


So, you got 2/20, when the average chance is 2/26, and you're complaining?

The only thing I'm wondering about is if you have all of the halloween rares/commons, does it guarentee you a halloween epic or legendary, or will it just give you a duplicate even if you don't have all the normal items.",10/14/2017 04:11 PM,"{""id"":""207576208610"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207482380297"",""name"":""blackfalcon""}}",post-67,36 posts,,https://us.battle.net/forums/static/images/avatars/overwatch/avatar-overwatch-default.png,Normal Legendary skins shouldn't drop from Event Loot boxes,1003

"I can't see how having both normal and event skins in a different tables gives us a ""bonus"" normal skins.

Seriously, I have two accounts and all loot boxes from arcade that I got (plus some others due lvling up) dropped trash and 1 normal legendary in both (A Doomfist and something else that I already forgot, characters that I don't play at all)...for god sake, the amount of time you ask to get 3k is absurd and knowing I can get normal Legendary skins from them discourage me from purchasing them at all.

I got the game last year at the end of this same event so I couldn't get any of the skins... and now probably I'll be lucky if I even get one :/

Jeff, we are asking to ONLY get event legionaries from event loot boxes because they are TIME SENSITIVE and EXPENSIVE to purchase. Any other Legendary on the table can be bought or whatever after the event. 24/7 52 weeks a year. It DOES I repeat, DOES take the spot of a potential event skin when you get normal legendaries, because even if both are possible to get, when you get a non event legendary it takes up a space, that could have been an event legendary. There's no way to tell, and it's completely unfair that they are included.

I normally drop $40 dollars every event but since I we are on our second time around it is easier to get the new ones. Also I saved 12000k credits between this even and the last.

I preferred the old system since it used to let me save a lot more currency but people complained because they didn't like the system and what we got while better for drops is not as beneficial for currency imo of course.

"To be honest the new drop system feels quite good to me.

I've already got every white and blue item from the event (except some of those RIP poses) and since I'm around lvl 830 and already got all of the non-event white and blue items too, I'm getting crates full of duplicates and ingame coins, sitting at around 11500 right now (ended last event below 3000 for sure but I don't remember the exact amount.

"Shot calling only seems to work if your team is in a good enough position to react to your callouts. That's why I play tanks (and shot call), because then I create the space my dps players need, and I'm calling out the crucial targets for us to focus on.

If you shot call as Genji, it won't matter if your team isn't up there with you. My advice to you would be to find a good tank player to duo with who will assist you on your shot calls. Just think of how effective a good Winston player at your rank would be if he assisted on targets with you.

*edit* I've mostly play with gold players, and from what I've noticed, they are skilled, however their positioning varies, and that's why a good tank who leads them (pushes forward with a shield or dives; while shot calling), seems to make a team of golds to shine. A lot of my gold friends are approaching Plat (or have recently hit plat) simply because they are utilizing the space I give them to their advantage. In my opinion, there are a lot of good gold players out there; and I stand by this.

If you can trio with a Tank and Healer, then I'd say you are set to go much further. Solo queue is a mix bag my friend, sometimes you get great cooperative teammates, and other times, it's like pulling teeth to try and get your team to reset and not trickle in.

"Recluse
The teased hero that never was, also known as the supposed Anchora (Orisa).

Bounty Hunter that holds the frontlines in battles. Commonly working with Talon (although for business she can’t say she does) Recluse will do whatever it takes to get her pay, including what she knows is wrong.

In Game:

Role:
* (Anchor) Tank

Health
* 500

Passives:
* Wall Climb
* Toxic Death - When Recluse is killed, she leaves behind an AOE that slows and damages targets 150 HP over 3 seconds.

Gun: Spineret
* Pink beam that shoots out of mouth
* Primary fire is similar to Zarya’s, around 25 DPS, no headshots. This takes no ammo.
* Secondary fire are small green pellets that are similar to D.Va’s, without headshots can do around 25 DPS. These shoot out of the green pads connected to her cybernetics in a rapid pace at 10 pellets per second.
* Ammo is 50 pellets, reload time is 3 seconds.

Shift Ability:
* Recluse forms into a hemispheric shape and forms a barrier between each of her legs.
* This is in four segments, each one having 1,250 health.
* No cooldown - barrier regeneration is 200 per second.
* This about the size of Winston’s bubble.
* She can shoot in this mode in both primary and secondary fire. However, there is a 50% damage reduction.

E Ability:
* Jumps a large distance very quickly.

Ultimate Ability:
* Spawns in two 100 health robotic spiders that plant themselves down. When you press Q, you can right click for each place that you want them to land. Left click to cancel, like Symmetra’s teleported/shield generator.
* You can cancel with one still remaining and your ultimate will remain at 50% and can continue charging. However. Only two can be placed at the same time.
* They heal 50 HPS and damage 25 DPS in a 5 meter and have a small bubble shield of 500 health.
* They take 2 seconds to set up and can be killed during that time. When spawning these in, Recluse remains still and unable to move for 2 seconds as well.

"ever since that theory was spreading around, i was so hyped for a spider hero

i definitely like the idea of giving more heroes the wall climb, it's upsetting it's specific to the shimada brothers, and who better to give it to than a spider

i'm a bit iffy with on-death mechanics, it's interesting, fits her, but after junkrat i'm not entirely sure anyone wants more of this

i mean, people want another flying hero, but could you imagine pharmercy+whatever the new one is? mercy would just be ping ponging between the two and it'd make the current issue even more rampant

if we got more on-death things, it would be insane to see both junkrat and her just jump near a payload in overtime and nearly drop a D.Va ult player-scattering effect

as for the ""multiple barrier"" idea, i actually really do like that, fitting for the multiple appendages, another anchor tank would be nice even though Orisa has sort of been going up to that, where they wanted her, but adding another might mean the previous issue again, where there's just too much stacked in one

however, i suppose a well placed EMP would make short work of that and turn it on them if it were executed poorly

i like the idea of a ""jumping spider' but.... if she can already wall climb, it's too much, especially because it changes her from anchor to dive tank, and it would create more of an issue.... so... not... really sold there

but her doing low dps, while being mainly focusing on throwing barriers around, might actually make a bunch of jumping around actually really cool, having her leap/climb into the backline with other flankers, and create an insane flank with another hero behind her while the rest of the team is pushing from the other side, just barriers on both sides of the enemy team, homuhglob that'd be so hawt

the ult is too confusing, i feel like every ult in this game is pretty straight forward aside from symmetra due to her needing some type of buff on offense/point B like they wanted to give her, and i feel like you've given them too much for what everything else you've suggested

all in all, you've given her so many mechanics, that i'm a little iffy on shoving into one hero, but i'd still love to actually see her be a thing

we already got Orisa as goathorselady, and it pretty much worked out well (minus her head being the size of africa and wide enough body to be so easily one shot by scattUH)

but i would honestly love to see a spider hero so much",12/19/2017 03:41 AM,"{""id"":""207591282519"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""184528524299"",""name"":""Nymphalidae""}}",post-4,693 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Nymphalidae-11669,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000800.png,New Hero Idea - Recluse,1003

"Symmetra could easily be balanced with a more supporting kit (healin turrets)

Bastion actually has a fairly powerful ult if used right it’s just very hard to set up. I agree he should be buffed as he is too situational like Symmetra and Mei but I think there are more places bastion can be used.

Mei is similar, she opens a lot of places up for getting in to choke points but at the cost of having a very difficult to use kit. The damage fall off needs to be reduced

No healing turrets. Symmetra is not and should never be a healer.

In most class based games, there are three types of mages: damage/nukers, healers, and debilitators. None of the supports fall into that last category, but instead have a little bit of it in some of their kits. Sym has a slow, Zen has discord, and Ana has sleep and anti-healing.

There are so many supportive abilities that haven’t been used in OW yet and lorewise Symmetra could really do anything. She bends light. She could have a blind, she could likely make holograms or hard light copies, prisons, etc. There are many more creative routes that could be taken with Symmetra to supplement a team aside from healing.",12/18/2017 01:03 PM,"{""id"":""207590881862"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":15,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207500181495"",""name"":""Ferret""}}",post-8,1930 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Ferret-11714,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000115D.png,F-tier heroes ignored out of fear and hatred?,1003

Really? Heros that are difficult for us lower ranked players to deal wih mechanically due to their simple abilities are not getting buffed because we cant deal with them, even though they are useless in pro scene and higher ranks. Its almost like this game is still mostly balanced for casuals. Instead of balancing for higher tiers and buffing the F-tier heros like Mei so that they are more skill incentivized to play them, Blizzard balances so that Casual Players can deal with them. Yet, balancing for pros has ben what has ""hurt"" the player base.

Symmetra is just badly designed. She functions specifically as a ""noob stomper"" and is terrible at high ELOs. She needs a rework.

Torb and Bastion are simply ""git gud"" heroes. They are fine in mid-ELOs. The solution there is simply for players to get better.

"[Long theory incoming]
For convenience sake I'd better add sub-topics

Concept of ""Skill Buffs""
On the topic of balancing F-tier heroes and casual vs pro, the topic of ""skill buffs"" is raised. In theory the heroes should be balanced such that they are all weaker at lower skill level while exponentially stronger at higher levels. In other words, the effectiveness of the heroes should all scale with the players' skill.

Difficulty of balancing by skill
However, I also understand it is difficult. For heroes with more direct design, it is easier to achieve as their kits' are flexible and their effectiveness scales with the players' decision almost proportionally. On the other hand, heroes that provides auxiliary effects are much harder to balance as their kit grants them static power, meaning their effectiveness can never be proportional to the players' skill.

The skill-balancing dilemma
In a mathematical sense(I know a lot of people hate it but it illustrates perfectly)
""Direct"" Heroes : Effectiveness = Skill Curve x Skill
""Auxiliary"" Heroes : Effectiveness = Skill Curve x Skill + Static Power
This creates a balancing dilemma. If both categories are to have the same effectiveness at the highest level, then the auxiliary heroes will always be used as they have higher impact/skill ratio. If otherwise, the auxiliary heroes will be useless after a certain critical point as their effectiveness will be surpassed by direct heroes.

Potential solution : Tolerance Area
It is not an unsolvable problem though, as everything is not that cut and dry. Other factors such as map, coordination and team composition will create variance. This creates a ""tolerance area"", where the effectiveness of a particular hero has a certain range while the skill of the player remains the same. If the ""tolerance area"" make up for the effectiveness difference between the heroes, they would be equally viable at the given skill level. More direct heroes is more viable before the critical point and more auxiliary heroes is more viable after that point.

Problem of tolerance area : SoloQ
However this also creates another problem regarding to soloQ environment. In the theoretical situation or the pro scene the above works as the players can manage the ""other factors"" well enough to obtain the bonus impact from the ""tolerance area"". However, in normal competitive mode this means other players are forced to play around the auxiliary hero in order to obtain that extra effectiveness, which potentially deteriorate the experience of other players.",12/18/2017 02:18 PM,"{""id"":""207592280822"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207417512229"",""name"":""WhyAlwaysMe""}}",post-20,842 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/WhyAlwaysMe-4619,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000A92.png,F-tier heroes ignored out of fear and hatred?,1003

Reaper's actually amazing. I love playing him and I hate playing against him. He kind of hard counters Zen because Zen has a relatively big hitbox.

"Yeah, because they don't have much to gain.

Players will play characters in QP that they enjoy even if it's less than optimal.

As a result, characters that aren't getting play in QP aren't fun for most people to play.

Many of the characters also aren't terribly fun to play against.

If a character isn't fun to play for most people and isn't fun to play against doing much work on it without a great idea isn't necessarily going to pan out. Straight buffs will just hit complaining and revamps risk annoying both those that play the character and those that don't.

Further, the discussion on hero balance is frequently dominated by players at the top which can be unrepresentative of the rest of the game and can lead to heros being rated incorrectly at least relative towards the whole game. Your average GM might not be able to dominated with Sym against their own rank but, the average Bronze probably could dominate with Sym against their own rank if they played her. Depending on where her issues start influences the value of fixing her.

You've also got the question of if the GM's actually want Sym to be viable at their rank.

I think that there's a very strong case for this, and add Sombra to that list. They seem overly aware of 'annoying to play against' as a complaint.
That excuse is completely invalid when we have Genji, Junkrat and Tracer in the game.

So u won't play sym then

If she's so easy get to gm with her simple

And don't say get gm with genji then because I never said he was easy either


Woah wait a minute here. Are you admitting that genji dwarfs sym in difficulty, and then trying to slide by it?

If sym and genji are same difficulty you should be able to get gm with genji right? But I didn't ask you to get gm with genji, I asked you to get out of plat with him.

But... from what you're saying even that's too much.

Your argument really fell apart there didn't it.
First how can I get out of play when I'm not pla
Second I never said sym and genji were equally skilled, you made that up in your head so don't put words in my mouth

My argument was that sym wasn't easy, not that she was the hardest hero so idk where you got that.

All I asked was if she is so easy can you get to masters with her

And the. You ignored that and turned it into ""get out of play with genji""

That has nothing to do with my argument, it has not changed
If she is so easy, why don't more people play her and get to masters and could you do that

That never changed you and only you stared making this about genius difficulty even though I literally said nothing about it

This isn't about genji

This is about symmetra

My question still stands can u get to masters with sym

I didn't say I could or could not with genji, which has no meaning because WE ARENT TALKING ABOUT GENJI

Ilyou say sym is easy

I say get to masters with her

Then you say get to masters with genji

What did that have to do with anything

Then what about popularity?

These heroes have a low pickrate, even in quickplay.

Do you think heroes who are less popular are more likely to get ignored by the balance team?


I think what factors in changes, is the way things are implemented. I mean, it took a year for Widow to get a number change on her grappling hook and mine changes. It wasnt even anything major. Whenever they implement a change, its something they are 'confident' in. Or at least thats what I noticed about how they go with the changes as even as horrible as they are (D.va, Hog and Mercy), they dont revert them, which may also prove to be a factor.

"People appear to have gotten f tier and niche confused as the same thing, yes there is some overlap, but f tier refered solely to pickrate and niche refers to the heros job, you can very easily argue that niche heros (like torb and sym) are characterised by relatively low pickrate and high winrates, and that they are well balanced in that they have a specific job in a team that they Excell at.
Where as many underpowered f tier heros are characterised by both low pickrates and winrates, take Sombra and Mei, both have been down in the dumps in both catagories for over a year now, either their cannot perform their niche job, or they were supposed to be general pick heros that should be viable in multiple situations but just aren't, either way they need work.

Side note, everyone saying ""Just look what happens with the reaction to junkrat"" yeah, junk needed buffs before but right now (on PC, I imagine it's worse on console) he is on something like 53% win rate and the number one dps pick by a long shot, so the negative reaction is not so much, I hate f tier heros and think they all need to stay there, but rather, junkrat is currently too strong and needs to be turned down a little.",12/19/2017 05:38 AM,"{""id"":""207591381767"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":4,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207437086184"",""name"":""Asryam""}}",post-65,495 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Asryam-1596,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000197B.png,F-tier heroes ignored out of fear and hatred?,1003

"Dear Blizzard,

I am an active member of the Overwatch India community which consists of several thousand passionate gamers. Within the short period time we’ve been playing, several of our players have made it to the top 500, Grand master and Master levels. There are also many who are working hard towards gaining higher SR scores. I spend at least 4 hours every day and I know there are many others who play even longer.

We love the game, but a lot of times find it frustrating that our experience in India is subpar because we suffer from large latencies on US, Europe and Asia regions. For example, with the best internet connection available here [ Bengaluru / Chennai], I get around 137 ms ping in the EU region and 68 or 200+ ping in US. While playing competitive, it gives the opposition an edge over us. It also ends up discouraging gamers who want to get really good but can’t do so because of slower connections in different parts of the country.

One really simple solution for this would be an India based server for Overwatch.

Here are some really good reasons why this is a great idea for Blizzard and for the Overwatch community in India.

1. Huge potential for e-sports: India has hundreds of thousands of e-sports gamers in the 15-30 age bracket. Students at every college have their own clans and teams which carry on for several years even after they start working. Recently, an electronic sports league was announced with a total prize money of around 100 crores INR or 15M $, set to launch in May 2017. With phenomenal success seen with other premier leagues in the country, we expect this to be a big hit with the gamer community in India, encouraging growth in numbers as well as quality of gamers in India.

Will Overwatch be a part of this tournament? We don’t know, but sure hope so!

2. Rapidly improving internet access: PC gaming needs good internet and India is finally seeing much better internet access all over the country with connections of 10 – 100 MBps getting pretty common. The pings for games however vary with ISPs and cities.

Does Overwatch benefit from this? Yes and no. No, because we have to connect via Singapore servers which introduce high latencies.

3. Community engagement: The gaming community is coming together like never before to make things better. The Overwatch India community, which is very active through Facebook, WhatsApp and discord recently organized an Overwatch Premier League to get people engaged. We found that there is some serious talent among us – from other games like CS, Quake, COD, Battlefield, MOBAs etc. We also meet up at LAN parties in different cities and online custom games to improve our game. We would love to hold many more LAN tourneys going forward with zero or low ping.

Are our LAN experiences great? Not really, because we still deal with high latencies as the game runs on distant servers and there is no LAN mode.

4. Gaming cafes: The number of PCs available for competitive gaming has improved significantly. Gaming cafes with the latest graphics cards from NVidia and AMD are springing up all over the country which enable first time Overwatch gamers to experience the game without having to buy a dedicated gaming PC/laptop. NVidia organized and concluded season 2 of its Overwatch tournament, with participation from 16 gaming cafes and some of the top Overwatch players in the country.

Do we have enough gaming cafes yet? Probably not, but this is a growing business opportunity which is bound to see large investments by Retail giants soon to cater to growing demand.

5. PC gaming market worth $36B in 2016, PC gaming hardware worth $ 30B in 2016: The gaming PC market in 2016 was estimated to be worth $ 36B in 2016, with Overwatch leading premium PC gaming at $ 586M. This paints a healthy picture for PC gaming and Overwatch.

Can India become a bigger market within this pie? Yes! With better access to gaming systems and games, India has the potential to match China/ Korea/ US in a few years.

The growth of PC gaming is closely linked some path-breaking PC gaming hardware released in 2016 by both NVidia and AMD in the form of Pascal and Polaris graphics cards. PC gaming hardware exceeded expectations of $24.6 B to hit $ 30.346B in 2016. In 2017, PC gaming can only grow bigger with a large number of gamers waiting to upgrade to AMD Ryzen or an equivalent Intel option.

The points listed above are some of the key reasons why Overwatch and PC gaming has been growing globally and in India. We want to see the Overwatch community grow and become a mainstream e-sport in India, along with CS: GO and DOTA. For this to happen, it would be greatly helpful if we could get a consistent ping less than 40 ms all over India. Currently, the average ping of Indians to Singapore is around 90ms – 100 ms or higher with 1-5% packet loss, this could greatly improve with a dedicated Overwatch server based in Mumbai. Mumbai has AWS data serves which can be used to achieve this, while at the same time reducing the load on Singapore. We believe Amazon Mumbai can be a great hub for Overwatch gamers from the India, UAE and SG.

The end result of a dedicated India server is that the game will grow much faster and there will be many more gaming professionals who will begin their gaming careers with Overwatch.

"Agree to this !
Being a gamer from india and being forced to play on EU servers or Americas because no other region gives us ping below 150 is a pain , and to play competitive with it, you can forget about playing dps heroes !
I hope Blizzard listens to the plea and we can play with a ping better than what we get nowadays !

"Blizzard you have made an amazing game .. and lots of people are starting to notice this game in India.

60 $ for a game is a substantial amount to pay for a game in India and people are really interested to go for it.

when new players have an amazing experience with the game at the beginning, then the game's popularity will increase with mouth publicity. the only hurdle in having an amazing experience is the horrible PING for people playing from India.

so please invest in having Overwatch servers in India so that this amazing game will be more popular in SEA countries.

Also investing in Amazon servers in India is very cheap when compared to other countries.

Hopefully this issue will atleast be acknowledged by Blizzard.",02/12/2017 08:43 AM,"{""id"":""207515598832"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":17,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207472289397"",""name"":""ENRYU""}}",post-8,5 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/ENRYU-11835,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000009DC.png,Here’s why India deserves a dedicated Overwatch server,1003

"An Indian server would serve the entire subcontinent, not just India. It would help reduce load on other servers and improve matchmaking for a sizeable community. Since, Overwatch is a MP based game, most people before buying the game ask about the nearby servers and the matchmaking period.
