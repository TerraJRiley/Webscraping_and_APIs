Academic Research pertaining to Conflict Resolution Tactics in Adolescent Dating Relationships (18+),"Hey everyone,

I am conducting a survey about conflict resolution tactics in adolescent dating relationships. This survey should take approximately 25 minutes. Participants must be at least 18 years old or older. All responses will be kept anonymous. Some of the information included in the study is sensitive in nature. If at any point you decide you no longer want to participate, you may exit the survey, and none of your responses will be recorded. If you wish to participate, you may access the survey at this link ([https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V96HV5R](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V96HV5R)). If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me ([gabriella.chavarria@my.maryvillecollege.edu](mailto:gabriella.chavarria@my.maryvillecollege.edu)) or my advisor ([karen.beale@maryvillecollege.edu](mailto:karen.beale@maryvillecollege.edu)) or the Maryville College Institutional Review Board ([IRB.Review@maryvillecollege.edu](mailto:IRB.Review@maryvillecollege.edu)).

I am particularly looking to increase my number of male participants to ensure fair representation of male opinions and experiences. As I will be testing gender differences or the lack thereof, I would especially appreciate your input. I am in the process of completing data collection, so the survey will only remain open for about 2-3 more days. Thank you so much for your participation, and please let me know if you have any questions!",OneY

That right there. Just because I am a man does not mean I am a mindless fuck machine whenever I get turned on and it is upsetting that it is widely accepted that just because I am a man I either just do not know it or will not admit it and I get this thrown at me all the time, especially since I have many female friends. Frankly it is blatant sexism. I have far better things to do all day than mindlessly think about sex and be consumed by the idea of sex so much my ability to think rationally just turns off when I am turned on. It is bull.

Have You Ever Had To Deal With Having A Hot Teacher?,"It's a pretty simple question that I think is worth asking, especially if you went to a public school like I did. Personally, I hated high school. Those were some of the most miserable years of my life. However, there was one bright spot and that was my 10th grade world history teacher.

I won't give her name. I'll just say that, compared to all the other teachers I'd dealt with, she was a breath of fresh air. For one, she was pretty young. She was in her late 20s when I took her class. She was very energetic and bubbly.

Also, she was hot. 

I won't get into specifics, but by almost every objective measure, even those related to teenage boys, she was beautiful and I was not the only one who noticed. One day, a classmate of mine dropped this infamous pick-up line on her.

""Hey, is your dad a terrorist? Because you're the bomb!""

I swear those were his exact words. My teacher laughed, but I don't think she understood the effect she had on teenage boys like me. Maybe she did and was just too polite to point it out. But I won't lie. Being in her class was a welcome reprieve from an otherwise awful high school experience.

That class was pretty evenly split, in terms of gender. And I know the boys behaved differently around her than they did for most teachers. It was a poorly kept secret, how much the male students were attracted to her. This being a collection of 16-year-olds, hormones were in full swing.

Now, I didn't see it as a distraction, my teacher being really attractive. It helped that I was really good at history and she appreciated that as well. Looking back on it, though, I think I did change my behavior for her more than I did any other teacher. I think the other boys in my class did so as well. I saw how differently some of them behaved in other classes compared to hers.

So that's my experience with a hot teacher. Does anyone else have an experience they would like to share? High school is a strange time for young men. Having a hot teacher does plenty to highlight that strangeness.",OneY

What exactly is circumcision?,"Infant circumcision is made more acceptable by believing the notion that there is a flap of skin at the end of the penis called the foreskin which hangs over the glans and circumcision simply removes that flap. This is factually incorrect. By thinking that the foreskin is separate or ""extra"" tissue it is easier to believe that its removal does little to impact or change the rest of the skin of the penis.

There is really no separate anatomical structure called the foreskin. Rather there is one single continuous skin sheath of the penis which is called the skin system. This single, uninterrupted skin sheath may, at any given time, fold to varying degrees over the glans or retract to reveal it. The amount of the skin system that is folded over can be referred to as the forefold of the skin system. Its extent changes often to accommodate degrees of erection, and it is never a separate structure from the skin of the shaft.

What the operation called circumcision actually does then is to interrupt and significantly reduce the skin system of the penis to a fraction of its normal anatomical and functional extent.

**The skin system of the penis**

The intact penis is covered by one single continuous skin sheath or skin system. The skin sheath is partly folded at different times. This folded part of the skin system is called the foreskin or prepuce.

The fold of skin is often mistaken as a single layer, or a flap of skin. This is wrong. Instead, it is a free, two-layer fold that forms when the skin coming down the penis from the shaft folds underneath itself somewhere near the tip of the penis then travels back to an attachment point behind the glans (see figures 6 and 4). The two sides of the fold do not adhere to each other even though they lie flat against each other appearing to form a single flap of skin.

Also, in the adult the skin system does not adhere to the glans so it can unfold back off of the glans, leaving it fully exposed. When we speak of this skin sheath we are not talking about the surface of the glans itself in the same way that we talk about the surface of the shaft, because the glans has no real skin. When we talk about the skin covering of the glans, this can only mean the foreskin. The foreskin is its skin covering.

**The fictitious foreskin**

A significant anatomical error has been made historically and continues today in describing the penis by delineating the ""foreskin"" as a separate anatomical structure from the shaft skin. People talk about the ""foreskin"" separately from the shaft skin. This is a mistake. It is not correct.

The foreskin is not a separate anatomical structure from the rest of the skin of the penis. This is actually an artificial separation. When the word foreskin is used, rather than referring to a separate part of the penis, it means the part of the continuous skin system which happens to be folded over the glans at any given time. So there is no real anatomical border to the ""foreskin."" Since the proportion of the skin system that is folded over the glans increases and decreases by folding and unfolding to various degrees all the time, we realize that ""foreskin"" is a poor way of describing the anatomy of the penis. Instead, more accurate terminology might be to describe that part of the skin system which covers the glans as the ""forefold of the skin system.""

Unlike the false border between ""foreskin"" and shaft skin, there is a real anatomical border which exists in the skin system. It is between the mucosal, or non-keratinized, part of the skin system (which consists of the inner lining of the foreskin along with the surface of the glans) and the keratinized part (which is the outer penile skin, including the outer foreskin). That border is at the most distal part, or tip, of the skin system - it is the tip of the forefold (see figures 6 and 7).

**The mobility of the skin system**

The entire skin system moves freely. In the intact (uncircumcised) male, the penis has a low friction gliding plane immediately beneath the surface of the skin which is like no other body structure. This means that the skin of the penis does not adhere to the underlying tissue the way that skin adheres to other parts of the body. This unique quality allows the entire skin of the penis to move as a unit back and forth longitudinally or around the shaft circumferentially making it the most mobile skin in the intact male.

The skin system covers the head of the penis to varying degrees depending on moment-to-moment factors such as the state of erection and temperature. The free fold of the skin system which we call ""foreskin"" unfolds and refolds constantly to varying degrees, adjusting to the current state of the penis. It is a very dynamic system. The foreskin, among other functions, provides the penis with a reservoir of skin which is needed during erection. The skin of the erect, intact penis is still mobile and loose, allowing the mucosal inner foreskin to roll back and forth over the glans (see figure 7).

Thus, the dividing line between what we call the skin of the shaft and foreskin is regularly crossed by the ""shaft skin"" or ""foreskin."" The delineated ""foreskin"" may become entirely ""shaft skin"" when the penis becomes more erect because it is now around the shaft. And if the penis shrinks momentarily beyond its usual flaccid state, perhaps due to a cold swim at the beach, some of the ""shaft skin"" is now ""foreskin"" because it covers the glans. The skin system is a dynamic, mobile and flexible skin sheath that moves and adjusts to the momentary needs of the penis (see figure 7). Such a system is not normally observed in the circumcised male.

Another anatomical error is committed in describing the foreskin as a flap of skin protruding from the shaft skin (figure 6a). This notion presumes that the foreskin is a single layer of skin, like the skin of the shaft, which grows from the shaft to cover the glans. In describing the foreskin this way it is easier to see it as redundant or ""extra skin"" and it is more difficult to see how removing it might impact the rest of the penis. This description of the foreskin is inaccurate. The foreskin is not ""extra"" skin which protrudes from the shaft. There is no extra skin on the body - this is a silly notion. Instead, it is a free, double-layered fold - an integral part of the skin system. The foreskin extends from a point on the shaft behind the glans to cover the glans then folds back underneath itself to the same attachment point on the shaft, usually near the glans (see figure 6). The eyelid works much the same way. The eyelid is not a single flap of skin, but rather two freely moving layers of a fold of skin, so that both the foreskin and the eyelid have two layers. That's why it is more appropriate to refer to the ""foreskin"" as the forefold of the skin system.

In reality then, infant circumcision does not remove the ""tip of the penis"" or ""redundant skin"" nor does it remove a separate structure called ""the foreskin."" Rather, infant circumcision deletes a significant percentage of the skin system of the penis, rendering the skin system relatively dysfunctional and rendering the penis less dynamic.

**The ""triple whammy""**

The circumcised penis loses sensitivity in three ways:
Loss of the foreskin nerves themselves. As has been demonstrated by studies such as the one by Dr. Taylor and by the testimonials of the majority of intact men, the inner foreskin possesses a greater density of nerve endings. It is thought to be more erogenous than even the glans. The is no question that the foreskin is a highly erogenous tissue. This tremendous amount of sensitivity is lost completely when the forefold of the skin system is amputated. In addition to this, the most sensitive part of the penis, the frenulum of the foreskin, is either partially or totally removed in most infant circumcisions. The frenulum is the continuation of the inner foreskin which attaches to the underside (ventral part) of the glans. Thus, a significant percentage, if not the majority, of erogenous nerve supply to the penis is removed in circumcision at birth.

Damage to the glans. The erogenous sensitivity that remains after circumcision is primarily in the glans. This is further reduced by removal of the protective foreskin which leaves the glans permanently exposed. Unlike the shaft of the penis, and most of the rest of the body, the head of the penis, does not posses its own attached skin. This structure, like the eyeball and the gums of the mouth, is a somewhat naked structure. Its surface is non-keratinized, like that of the gums, the eyeball, and the clitoris in women. That means that it does not posses a protective thick layer like the keratinized skin of the outer penile skin system. Like the gums and the eyeball, the glans of the intact penis has a retractable skin covering. The skin covering of the glans is the foreskin. The eyelid is very similar in architecture to the foreskin. If the eyelid were removed and the eyeball were to become keratinized, you'd have a much harder time seeing. The same is true of the glans. It becomes artificially keratinized (dry, hardened, discolored, and wrinkled) as a result of permanent exposure, and thus less sensitive. Because most American men are circumcised and have a glans of this nature, it is harder to notice the abnormality. But just compare the glans of an intact man with that of a circumcised man next to each other and you'll notice a big difference. Thus, in addition to removing lots of erogenous nerve endings in the inner foreskin and frenulum, circumcision further desensitizes the remaining sensitivity of the glans by leaving it exposed.

Loss of skin mobility. The nerve endings in the glans are predominantly complex touch receptors also known as mechanoreceptors. This is different from the light touch receptors of the skin which detect surface friction. The mechanoreceptors are best stimulated by massage action rather than surface friction. Thus, the glans is best stimulated to feel pleasure by a rolling massage action. With an ample and highly mobile skin system that rolls over the glans with pressure from the opposing surface, this optimal stimulation of the glans is achieved while avoiding direct friction of the delicate glans surface. Direct friction tends to fire off pain receptors causing irritation and also causes further keratinization of the glans. With the skin system of the penis significantly reduced by circumcision, the mobility is essentially gone and now the penis is a static mass with no dynamic self stimulation mechanism. Now, it must be rubbed. Direct friction is now the primary form of stimulation. So then circumcision further reduces erogenous sensitivity in the penis by reducing skin mobility and thus the ability to use the foreskin to massage the glans. The combination of foreskin and glans in concert results in an even higher level of stimulation which is unknown to the circumcised male.

Conclusion

Circumcision of an infant male significantly reduces erogenous pleasure potential in his penis when he becomes sexually active and continues to be reduced as he ages until, in many cases, he is left with relatively little sensation.

**Adult Circumcision vs. Infant Circumcision**

A common misconception is that infant circumcision is preferable to adult circumcision because it spares a man pain and trauma. Many physicians however say the opposite and critics admit that most of their objections to infant circumcision cannot be applied to the adult procedure. Here's why:

More precise with better outcome. Circumcision of an adult can be more precise and less risky than for the infant. This is because the adult penis is fully formed. Many plastic surgeons operate on the penis in the erect state because this way it is clear to what extent the skin is stretched during erection. In the infant, this more precise method cannot be employed. Also, based on the knowledge of his own penis, the adult patient can specify how much tissue to remove, the infant cannot. In terms of how much tissue to remove, there is much more guess work involved in the infant and often too much skin is removed. In adult circumcision precise instruments are used. In the infant, usually more cumbersome and less precise instruments like the Gomco clamp are used. The results of operating on a fully formed penis, in the erect state, with precise instruments by a trained surgeon, benefit the adult and not the infant.

Reduced risk of injury. For the same reasons mentioned above, injury to the penis is less likely in adult circumcision than in infant circumcision. It is less likely that too much or too little tissue will be removed and the chances of lacerating the glans itself are also minimized. Scarring is also reduced in the adult.

Reduced loss of sensitivity. Because in the adult, the penis has had many years to develop with a foreskin covering, the glans is fully sensitive at the time of the circumcision. The glans has grown with its protective covering and the foreskin has already separated naturally from the glans. This spares the adult some of the sensitivity loss that occurs when circumcision is performed at birth. At birth, the foreskin must be torn away from the glans to which it is normally adhered. Then, the denuded glans of the infant spends much time exposed to caustic urine while in diapers. In adult circumcision this early damage to the glans is avoided.

Personal choice. With adult circumcision the patient is making a personal choice to have himself circumcised. He has the option of comparing the pros and cons and has had the opportunity to know what having a foreskin is like. This eliminates the ""lack of choice"" objection made by critics. With elected adult circumcision, critics see no violation of rights.

Reduced potential psychological effects. With adult circumcision potential psychological effects are reduced. This is because the patient understands the experience. He knows why it is happening and that he has chosen this. Anesthesia is used in the adult and is usually omitted or ineffective in the infant. In contrast, the infant has an experience of inexplicable pain and terror which he cannot rationalize as an adult. Some speculate that this intensely painful experience for the infant can lead to problems later on. Although on the surface it may seem that an infant is less sensitive to or unaware of the circumcision experience, he does experience it fully and because of his very formative and psychologically sensitive age, the experience is thought to be potentially more impacting than it is for the adult.

Even though the facts do not support the claim that adult circumcision is ""worse"" than infant circumcision, some pro-circumcision advocates contend that adult circumcision is painful, traumatic and dangerous, and that for this reason most adult men who are intact choose to remain uncircumcised. But when intact men are asked about the idea of being circumcised, most say that they have no desire to give up this part of their body - there is no reason to even consider it. Their foreskin gives them no more trouble than their eyelids, lips or testicles. Instead it affords them pleasure and comfort. Anti-circumcision advocates say that it is ridiculous to presume that the idea would even cross an uncircumcised man's mind. To them, it is the same as asking why intact women don't think about having the clitoral foreskin removed.

My dad is a great guy... Well, he was, but in his old age (age 63), he's just a chore cuz he doesn't work. He relies on others to get him by, after 45 years of being the hardest worker in the world.

Alpha male and dumbbells,"I spent my 30's under the thumb of a controlling wife.  I'm in my 40's now.  Back then, the more I succumb to her wishes the more she seemed to hate me.  The longer it went on, the worse our relationship became.  I was lost and had no idea why I always felt like such a loser.  I had a classic ""dead bedroom,"" even though I was doing dishes and making breakfast and taking care of kids.  Nothing I did made my wife ""happy.""  I was a shell of a man. I wanted what I had in my 20's!

One day, I was bemoaning the fact I had not had sex in several months and decided to spend my pent-up sexual energy at a gym.  I was too embarrassed at being fat and out-of-shape to actually join a gym, so I bought two 10-lbs dumbbells and a yoga mat.  I started with a crushing 15-minute workout on the back porch (that was all I could do).  I was sore as shit the next day.  I decided that was a BAD idea and did a really LIGHT workout the next time: just 3 lifts -- 10 reps each; it took maybe 5 minutes.  I was still a loser in my mind, but I had a plan: do more every time!

Over the next year, my marriage did not get much better, but I started getting better.  I had developed a routine of 10 different lifts, then multiple sets of all the 10 lifts, just increasing the numbers day-by-day... then increasing to 15lbs dumbbells and starting over...  It WAS easy.  I made it easy, just making really small increases every session and sticking with 3 days a week: Monday, Wednesday and Saturday - even in the rain or the cold - there was always a shower afterwards, anyway!

I had also found a new way to eat - something called ""clean kitchen"" that my kids were interested in trying.  After that year, I needed new clothes - a smaller waste line and larger chest and arms.

Two years after: I'm still doing what I call ""light workouts"" (I'm never sore the next day), they take about an hour and now I'm up to 35-lbs dumbbells (at a real gym), but my life is a little different.  My wife is not so reserved in the bedroom anymore - as a matter of fact, she quite ""encouraging!!""  A long dry-spell is 3-4 days, not 6-8 weeks!!!  I don't do dishes much anymore or cook - somehow the wife took up those jobs again, but I still do it when she's busy (not as a ""favor"" expecting a reward, but as a man who has responsibility to his family).  I still spend tons of time with the kids...

The dumbbells somehow changed me.  Not just physically, but spiritually.  As my strength grew, so did my confidence... as my fat shrank, so did my fears.. as my stamina grew, so did my status with my family.  As I reclaimed my rightful place in society as a MAN, I remembered all the lessons of manhood from my father and grandfathers (and grandmothers).

Was it easy?  Truthfully, it was!  It only took patience.  I'm not a body-builder by anyone's standards, but I'm not ""soft"" anywhere either.  My clothes fit nicely, I can walk a flight of stairs (or 20 flights), I can fuck for what seems like hours (it's not hours, so don't get excited - the point is, it is MUCH better!).  JUST be patient and work YOUR plan.

We are much happier as a family, now.  The wife no longer tries to ""lead"" or be bossy - she still wants what she wants, but she uses ""feminine charm"" rather than being a nagging bitch.  Back in the day, she deserved to be a nagging bitch - she was stuck in a marriage with a ""fat loser.""  Once the ""fat loser"" died, and the ""20-year old me"" she fell in love with returned, it all turned around.  The funny part is, I didn't really lose much weight.  I started at 230 and am now 220, but my body shape is totally different (so don't get on the scales expecting weight-loss).

[Moderator Approved] Have uncomfortable or unwanted sexual experiences impacted your life?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a PhD candidate from the University of Missouri - St. Louis in the process of collecting data for an IRB-approved academic research study looking at how uncomfortable, unwanted, distressing, or traumatic adult sexual experiences have impacted the lives of men and women. The thing is, I've been getting a lot of responses from women, but very few men have shared their thoughts. I really want to make sure that men have a voice in this survey because the results could actually be used to justify making modifications to therapy protocols we offer to men with unwanted or traumatic sexual experiences.

Historically, I'm sure most of you know that research on distressing, unwanted, or traumatic sexual experiences has focused almost exclusively on women as victims with little mention of the fact that men can also have similar experiences. I'm posting on this subreddit because I'm hoping that those of you currently age 18 or older who have had these experiences **at age 14 or later** would be willing to share your thoughts about how it has impacted you and the way you view yourself, other people (including intimate and non-intimate relationships) and the world in general.

I'm donating $5 to a charity of your choice (selected from a list at the end of the survey) in return for your participation. The reason we're not paying participants directly is because we want to keep this survey anonymous - we don't collect any identifying information. There is no way we can trace your responses back to you. Survey takes about \~30 minutes to complete.

Given that research on men's unwanted or traumatic sexual experiences lags behind research with women, I'm open to your comments about/reactions to the survey. Feel free to critique as you see fit.

And finally, once the survey is closed, I'm happy to share the results of this survey on this forum if anyone is interested. Feel free to distribute the link to other guys who might be interested in taking the survey as well.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts and comments. And if you have any questions, please comment on this post or message me - I'm happy to answer.

Kavanaugh,"I think a discussion regarding Kavanaugh and the sexual allegations him are appropriate for this sub.

Here, I'll start:  are some crimes so heinous that they have no moral expiration date, even if they have a criminal statue of limitations?  Which crimes?  Is there a spectrum?

I will say that I am glad that my current employment is not dependent on the actions I may or may not have performed as a 17 year old, some 30 years later.  Who I was then and the opinions I held then are not remotely reflected in the actions or decisions I make today.  We expunge the criminal record of minors, and even if he had been arrested, convicted, and jailed as an adult he would have completed his sentence by now, if not had his record cleared.  Do we never allow an individual to rehabilitate?  Does it depend on the crime? 

Can this even be discussed without minimizing the crime or the impact on the victim?  

This is not merely academic.  A L2 sexual predator moved into my neighborhood some time ago.  He was caught, convicted, and did his time.  His record shows that he like(d) young boys.

He now is married, with a wife, and boy and girl children.  My wife has forbidden my sons to not only interact with him, but his children as well.  Is he still a risk? If yes, why not be behind bars?  If not, why does the stigma persist?

I have worked with two individuals that were terminated over allegations of pedophilia.  One accuser was my co worker's wife, who then proceeded to divorce him.  I've remained in contact, and he can't find work anywhere, and being unemployed, doesn't the financial resources to legally fight for his innocence, let alone provide for his children or have his own place to sleep.

'#metoo is obviously a real issue and all men should be allies of women in every situation and help prevent it when they can.  But I think we also need to keep conscious that it can be weaponized and not always for legitimate reasons.  

How one distinguishes is of course the question, and I can't propose any suggestions.  But I think it's worth discussing.   ",OneY

The Dick Pic,"The Dick Pic phenomenon is well known, when it comes to online dating or just general interactions with men online it's a concern many have.  Their have been many assumptions to what causes men to do this and in certain circles they clearly believe it's a form of misogyny. 

Yet, I'm wondering if the reasoning is more about male self worth than anything else.  The reasoning behind such thoughts could go down numerous rabbit holes but none the less it seems very plausible.

Many men view their penis as an important extension of themselves.  Some might say it's the culmination of their manliness, neatly wrapped in an easily photographical location.  The one part of their body they view is the most important to any sexually interested partner.

Could it be that men submit these pictures not as a form of intimidation but instead trying to convey their self worth?  That they believe this one part of their body is the only thing that other people care about?  

When these men send unsolicited dick pics are they really just trying to say ""does this make me worth something to you?""  

It would be easy to say it's because men are just taught that women are their property or exist for their pleasure.  It would be easy to dismiss the phenomenon as men simply being mysogonistic or sexual predators.

If men didnt value their penis so much then it wouldn't be the center of those pictures to begin with.  So if men value it so highly then wouldn't it also make sense that they define it as their own self worth?

Furthermore, I think the main concern isn't so much the pictures themselves but why men, these men, believe their dick is all they have to offer someone else.  So much time is spent giving support for women who are getting these unsolicited pictures that nobody stops to think why these men feel they have to do it.

Nobody is actually trying to define the root of the problem, just interested in making it go away.  Like many issues facing men, it's easier for everyone to just punish and bury it instead of actually trying to solve the problems.  Easier to shame them instead of seeing this as a crisis of identity for many men.

I dont condone unsolicited pics of any nature, but one had to ask ""why?"".  If this was only happening to 1 individual with millions of men sending the pictures it would be one thing.  That type of problem could be dismissed as mysogony or entitlement.  Yet its far bigger than just 1 person getting these pics.  Something of this scale speaks to those sending not receiving the pictures.  

If it is a crisis of mens self worth then what can be done about it?  What is making men feel this way and how come it isn't all men?  What needs to take place in a man's life that this type of behavior develops?  What part is society playing that triggers this, or is it also a innate sex based characteristic?",OneY

23 and Bad Beard,"So I recently got a blood test done and it showed my testosterone being 969 ng/dl which I am told is above average.

My Grandpa on my mom's side could at least grow full stuble, but I haven't seen any photos of him with a full beard, but stuble everywhere is more than what I can get.

My dad has a walrus like mustache and almost always has a salt and pepper five o clock shadow. He said he got his somewhere in between 20-24 since that's when he was in the service and it was growing almost immediately after he got out of the Army.

I have tried minoxidil on my face for over 4 months with no affect and was even taking ""beardilyzer"" pills which gave me plenty of biotin, but I realized I was getting plenty through eggs anyways.

I'm not sure what else I can do. My ""beard"" will only grown on my chin and side burns. The rest might be spotted whiskers.

"A Comprehensive, Condensed Guide to Reading About Sexually / Romantic Isolation that Can Happen, Even to Good Men In Dating","# Too long; Didn't read (Tl;Dr)

**People on here have been asking for a Tl;Dr version of my posts for ages. Well, here it is. The following post covers:**

* **an introduction to topics related to Good Men (GMs), especially Sexually/Romantically Unsuccessful Good Men (SRUGMs) and what is meant by these terms**
* **masculinist detractors of SRUGMs and what this means**
* **feminist detractors of SRUGMs and what this means**
* **general detractors of SRUGMs and what this means**
* **SRUGM practical approaches and what this means**
* **general discussion about SRUGMs**
* **additional sections to the GoodMenGoodValues (GMGV) Primer that discusses these topics**

&amp;nbsp;

One of the main themes of my post below is that GMs (as they are envisioned by GMGV) believe in the following set of principles:

* anti-feminist, anti-traditionalist egalitarianism

* ideological centrism (state-regulated capitalism)

* moral rather than amoral (as opposed to red pill theories about dark triad personality traits)

* a dating strategy that requires women take equal responsibilities as well as privileges

And the post therefore looks at the dating from this narrative: genuinely good men with attractive and desirable traits but struggles in the dating world anyway. As per the statements mentioned above, Good Men falling behind in dating seems to be happening because of social contexts that seem to be relevant to the Red pill versus feminist / progressive narrative. In the post, I define these social contexts as the ""traditionalist / feminist paradigm"". In short, the basic point is that sexual and romantic isolation can happen in dating, even to GMs and that this is in spite of common misconceptions (which will be addressed in the below guide).

This section is devoted to covering advanced topics that have not been covered in Sections A-E. If you have read the whole [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) [Primer^(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/contents) up to this point you will have developed a certain depth and insight into our subject matter, regardless of whether you agree or not with the central premises to this community. In this Section we will look at some of the subject matter that is less easy to grasp:

* the intersection with our own [Platform^(33)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_platform) and [other ideological frameworks^(39)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-f#wiki_1._what_is_purple-pilled.2C_ideologically_centrist.2C_intersectional-humanist_srup_theory.3F): the [Purple Pill^(40)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_the_purple_pill.2Fpurple_pill_.28tpp.2Fpp.29), Ideological Centrism and the theory behind the broader community of [Sexually / Romantically Unsuccessful People (SRUPs)^(41)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_sexually_.2F_romantically_unsuccessful_people_.28srups.29).

These include:

 

 

* **Addendum: Resources That Have Been Reviewed By GMGV**

In the [Addendum^(47)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/addendum), we include our list of [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) reviewed resources from a [Sexually / Romantically Good Man (SRUGM)^(17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_sexually_.2F_romantically_unsuccessful_good_men_.28srugms.3A_.22shruggems.22_.2F_.22ssruggems.22_.29) perspective and explain how it is relevant to our central theme and what the relation is to meta-narratives explored through Sections A - F of the [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) [Primer^(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/contents).

 

 

* **Appendix: Subsidiary Topics**

The [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) [Appendix^(48)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/appendix) is dedicated to exploring subsidiary topics that support the meta-narratives around [GMGV's^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) central themes, as established through Sections A-F. These topics were too long and difficult / boring to read when included in the main body of the Primer which is why they have since been moved over here. To understand the purpose of these Sections, it is best advised for you to see which parts of the [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) [Primer^(2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/contents) they were linked to, which is referenced under the Extra Reading subtitle of each separate Section.

 

 

* **Glossary: Terms and Acronyms Used In GMGV and Related Communities**

[GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) is related to, although ultimately separate from many communities throughout the Pillosphere, [Manosphere^(12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_manosphere_.2F_masculinism) and the ideological spectrum as a whole. This means that there is a very large baggage of jargon that is related to those [Platforms^(33)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_platform) and can be difficult to get your head around and hence, this is the purpose of the [GMGV^(1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) [Glossary^(5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary). If there's a term, abbreviation or acronym that's not on this list, there's a good chance it will be covered through using the [Urban Dictionary search function^(49)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=search).

Anyone ever have epididymitis for more than a few months?,"Hey all, I have a health related question, so if this isn't allowed, please remove it or let me know and I'll take it down. My doc diagnosed me with epididymitis at the end of April. I did 30 days of antibiotics without much relief. Saw a urologist and said to wait another 30 days to see what happens. (He suggested rest and switching to briefs or a jock strap for a while instead of wearing my normal boxers or boxer briefs.) 

It's now September, and symptoms are still there. I visited my doctor who told me to just keep waiting (in addition to diagnosing me with a hydrocele).  

Has anyone else had Epididymitis or a hydrocele for a long period of time and have any tips to feel better or get rid of it? Thanks very much for your help!",OneY
I have been having a dull ache in my left testicle and groin. Any help?,"Sorry if this is long, but I want to be thorough. 

I’m 24, 5’8” about 213lbs. To start,  the discomfort is a dull ache like I’ve said in the title. There is no PAIN truthfully, it is more like I’m just hyper aware of my left testicle, always. I hope that makes sense. Sometimes the discomfort shifts to the veins above, sometimes to the groin above that. The discomfort is only present when I’m sitting for a long period of time. When I stand, it dissipates moderately fast. 

Everything feels fine and normal. My fiancée is in PA school (she knows what my boys usually feel like) does not feel anything out of the ordinary. I had the discomfort consistently for a week in early August and I did go to the doctor. She felt around, found nothing as well. She tested me for the STDs which all came back negative. She did send me to get a lower pelvic sonogram which came back negative for a inguinal hernia. Around the middle of August the discomfort just went away. 

Until last week, when it came back. Same as before. There is no tenderness when I touch Captain Lefty (the nickname my fiancée and I adopted for no good reason other than it got frustrating saying “my left ball” over and over). It doesn’t hurt to cum or anything. Idk if that is relevant but again, I’m just being thorough haha. 

Captain Lefty swells slightly throughout the day just as Captain Right does (google tells me that occasional swelling throughout the day is normal). 

I’m going to request a testicular ultrasound this week to see if they detect any lumps, swollen veins like varicocele, or anything else that could indicate the source of discomfort. I’m nervous it could be testicular cancer, or something worse. Even though the outlook of most everything I can find on Google is positive, the stress of the unknown is having a major effect in my life. It gets hard to concentrate on work, or even when hanging out with family and friends. 

Has anyone had a similar thing happen? I’d just like some direction or advice because I don’t want to keep paying for ultrasounds and doctors visits when in reality I’m just wearing too tight of briefs or something. 

Thanks!",OneY

Men who have suffered testicular cancer. I might have found a lump and I'm scared.,"I go to the doctor tomorrow. I have had it as long as I can remember and always assumed it was just fatty tissue but today i checked and it just felt different. It's a little lump located on the bottom on my right testicle. If feel like it might kind of hurt but it's so faint I wonder if the pain is just my imagination going wild with my worry. IDK, does this sound familiar to you guys? I'm really really worried. Because, one it's cancer and two my wife and I are working on starting our family and what If I waited to long and now we will never be able to have children of our own. And she desperately wants a child. Anyways. That's where my head is. 

*UPDATE* One. Thanks for all for all the support.
Two. I was overracting a bit. (Cancer scares the ever loving crap out of me) Doc said the lump is normal but it does seem slightly swollen (I could have knocked it around alittle or pinched it when sitting down) he's ordering and ultra sound just o be safe but It's all good.

[GMs ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_good_man_.2F_good_men_.28gm.2Fgms.29) can fall behind in dating and be [SRU ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_sexually_.2F_romantically_unsuccessful_people_.28srups.29) for lots of reasons. At [GMGV ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29), we recognise this but we tend to [take away emphasis away from looks ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-d#wiki_5._so_what_traits_can_be_seen_as_attractive.2Fdesirable.3F) as well as other perceived flaws people assume must be the case with [SRUPs ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_sexually_.2F_romantically_unsuccessful_people_.28srups.29).

It means we are ridiculed by [incels^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_involuntary_celibate_.28incel.29), [derailed^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-d#wiki_4._isn.27t_attractiveness.2Fdesirability_subjective.3F) by general detractors, [called sexists^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-c#wiki_2._the_way_gmgv_discusses_hypergamy.2C_post-wall_behaviours_and_the_big_question_is_sexist) by feminists, told to [""settle down""^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-b#wiki_2._isn.27t_the_solution_for_gms_monogamy.3F) by traditionalists and [told we're emasculated pussies^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-b#wiki_1._don.27t_traditionalists_and_manospherites_hurt_gms_also.3F) by the [RP crowd ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_the_red_pill.2Fred_pill_.28trp.2Frp.29)&amp; co.

[GMs ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_good_man_.2F_good_men_.28gm.2Fgms.29) can have a number of things going for us. As mentioned, we can

* be genuinely kind, empathetic, compassionate, etc. and therefore does not use acts of kindness to get into a woman's pants
* have genuinely attractive qualities and therefore only seeks to date women of the same league
* still struggle with dating

What's more, we can be engaged in a number of activities,

* online dating
* clubs and societies
* basic hygiene
* getting out of the house
* just being confident
* just being ourselves
* approaching women
* having purpose and ambition in our lives
* looking for self-actualisation in passions of ours that lie outside of dating women
* going to bars and night clubs
* hitting the gym
* consuming works of art, literature or filmography by feminist women with strong female protagonists
* seeing a therapist/psychiatrist/other related expert

And still have a hard time with an ***inegalitarian dating game that does not benefit men***. So again, what's going wrong?

Well, at [GMGV ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29), we believe that a society polarised between [traditionalist and feminist ideologies^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/section-b#wiki_4._isn.27t_the_reason_gms_have_dating.2Fsexual_difficulties_because_they_mistakenly_believe_what_makes_them_.22virtuous.22_also_makes_them_sexually_attractive_to_women.3F) have caused [social pressures/obstacles ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/index#wiki_22._what_are_the_social_pressures.2Fbarriers_for_gms_in_dating.3F) for men in dating.

However, [GMGV ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/glossary#wiki_r.2Fgoodmengoodvalues_.28gmgv.29) does not think their preferences are so easily to reducible to looks as incels assert.

Hypergamy ([rather than promiscuity ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/index#wiki_21._isn.27t_the_solution_for_gms_monogamy.3F)) seems to be an equal issue then, not greater or less than these problems I just mentioned. Men are disadvantaged in dating due to the social pressures and barriers I just mentioned. I would say this is a problem in particular with [the men who struggle to practice amoral, Machiavellian dating strategies such as with RP ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/index#wiki_6._don.27t_traditionalists_and_manospherites_hurt_gms_also.3F) but also the ones who object to [feminist hypocrisy in dating ^([click here])](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues/wiki/index#wiki_23._don.27t_you_know_feminist_men_are_more_sexually_and_romantically_successful.3F).

The way men and women's deaths are reported in the media.,"Something I noticed a couple of years back is that normally when men's deaths are reported, their gender is not mentioned explicitly. The language used is ""X miners were killed"" or ""Y combatants were killed"" in reference to men, whereas I've found it much more common to see headlines like ""Z women killed as part of event such-and-such"".

It seems to me that this normalizes and hides the violence and danger that men experience, and makes loss of female life exceptional and noteworthy.

An example of this is [this article from the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/24/more-than-25-children-and-four-women-killed-in-air-strikes-in-yemen?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other) which I feel is a typical example.

"I don't care if I am the Common Denominator, It's NOT My Fault that I'm Single","I've heard this one a lot. People always like to blame the man for his lack of sexual or romantic prowess. If you're discussing your issues online, people will say that merely talking about them is misogynistic and therefore a clear example of why you are sexually/romantically unsuccessful (because women can *smell* your misogyny and nobody with anti-social, anti-intellectual, sociopathic or misogynistic traits ever got laid, ever). Furthermore, if you are getting rejected by whole scores of women, YOU are the common denominator.

And if anyone thinks this is just feminists who say this it's not true. Dating coaches like Mark Manson say this in his book, models:

&gt;Just to name an obvious example. Men often come to me and say something like this: “I go out and try to meet women, but the problem is all of the girls in my town are catty and immature. So I guess I just need to move to a new city.”Really? So, it’s not you who’s screwed up, it’s the 150,000+ single women in your city who are all screwed up... in the exact same way... What are the odds of that?

I don't feel like digging up any more relevant quotes but PUA forums are littered with this kind of advice too. Ok, so Manson and some of those PUAs may be a little bit feminist also (I don't know them personally, I really couldn't tell you). But it really isn't just feminists - oh no, it is traditionalists too like Jordan Peterson see 2m20s onwards:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMqSBB3ZTY&amp;t=2m20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsMqSBB3ZTY&amp;t=2m20s)

Apart from anything else this is an appeal to popular opinion but that argument doesn't usually sway intellectuals because it mainly applies to mathematical/logical principles rather than subjective arguments like morals, or indeed attractiveness/dating/etc.

But look, let's see what other common denominators are apart from me, the person actually doing most of the approaching, putting time and effort into myself to make sure I am the best, most attractive, most authentic version of myself I can be.

# Social pressures/barriers are the number one reason for GMs falling behind in dating

Normally people only talk about the social pressures on women - that they shouldn't sleep around or flirt with guys (even Good Men - GMs) because then they will be called ""sluts"", they won't be seen as marriage material. This does actually make dating harder for the GMs falling behind (not saying *all* GMs are) because the women we do approach will distance themselves from us. I consider myself quite good looking - not a Chad or a Lebron James but still above average when I'm looking presentable and slipped into something stylish. But I do have a bunch of issues with this in spite of possessing many of the traits that should make me theoretically compatible with a lot of high quality women out there. I am compassionate, sensititive, interesting, passionate and I do also work out, pursue my ambitions and other stereotypically masculine things. So what is it then. Why would guys like me be failing in this dating environment. We can't be all the things we say we are because otherwise we would have met someone by now right.

**It's because we don't work well with these social circumstances.** I'm not saying my experiences talk for all GMs but lets look at some of the guys who have things in common with me:

\- GMs like me don't like bars and clubs because of the way people behave in those places: it's animalistic. And no, that doesn't mean I'm boring and I don't like to drink, it just means people act like fucking shitheads in bars and nightclubs. For example you can't go to those places alone because then you are ""*that guy*"" - a weirdo, someone who's just gone there looking for sex, someone to stay away from, possibly even laugh at or ridicule, someone who the bouncers will be keeping their eyes on, etc. Even with friends, you've still got to deal with guys trying to push their weight around, bragging about the size of their dicks in the urinals, interrupting your set when your trying to talk to a cute girl to steal her away from you\* (the same guys who - yes, they are often successful with women\*) and you've still got to deal with bitchy superficial women, loud music that drowns out conversation, aggressive drunks, arsehole bouncers, etc. Those places are nightmares.

\- dating advice sucks. It's either red pill, amoral dating strategy: ""be manly man, GRRRR; ignore rejections - those are shit-tests; drive your way past LMR or you're a lil bitch; fuck conversation and getting to know her be manly man"" or it's feminist namby pamby crap that doesn't work ""just be kind, respectful, get to know her, be gentle"". There's few coaches out there who recognise the true need for a fine balance between a masculine approach and feminine sensitivity. Then there's the black pill, it doesn't even give advice unless you have a very specific facial structure to begin with (in which case you should ""just lift and lookmax bro"") - it tells you that ""it's over"", even though so many studies have shown the variability in women's tastes in regards to aesthetics compared to men and that most women do not even prioritise looks as number one anyway. All the other mainstream outlets when I was 18 and figuring out how I was going to make my entrance into the dating scene just said vague bullshit as well, ""buy her drinks, be smart and presentable, approach her right and be confident"". It's because of all this lack of advice that paved the way for the red pill to begin with because deep in that trash can are a few actually semi-decent semi-workable things. You've just got to dive deep (which shouldn't even be necessary). Then there's all the scam PUA gimmicks that's just obviously there to take a large chunk out of your wallet.

\- related to the feminist advice that doesn't work, all of the ""just get a few hobbies and join some clubs"" bull doesn't work because the rules in those environments make it just as difficult to approach women as they do in bars and nightclubs. Sure your typical tennis court or book club are friendlier places than some night club shit hole.

\- we don't like being told we have to seek traditional arrangements like monogamy. I know some guys on here want traditional arrangements and marriage whatever but practising that lifestyle and saying it should be for everyone are two completely different things. It's so hypocritical for the feminists who say that we need to treat women right and find one to settle down with, not treat her like fuck meat or whatever but simultaneously argue sex positivity and that women should be allowed to sleep around without being slut-shamed. And it's ironic when Jordan Peterson talks about how (socially) ""forced monogamy"" is supposed to help ""incels"" or whatever because they have more choice now that promiscuous men like Lebron James but actually slut-shaming women just makes it harder for GMs to approach because of the women who want to pretend like they aren't sexual or whatever because of the social pressures.

On this last point during his interview with Rogan where he ""clarified"" his position about pressured monogamy (I did not find it in the slightest bit convincing, this article forms the basis of my opinion why forced monogamy is a [shit solution](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2018/06/11/the-wrong-way-to-deal-with-the-incel-phenomenon-and-ideas-for-a-better-way/) for GMs who fall back) his problem was he was focussing on helping out ***incels*** with his ""solution"". I mean, I get that not all incels are the same (I definitely don't want to start railing against the GMs who fell for incel cult like I did), but a significant part of these fellows we're talking about rape and paedophilia apologists who tell naive and innocent newcomers to their communities (hands up, I was one of them) ""it's over"", ""take the blackpill"", ""stop coping start roping"". I really could not give a *fuck* about this unsavoury crowd who wants to help *them*? Besides pressured monogamy wouldn't help them anyway.

So because he was focussing his solution for ***incels,*** it doesn't surprise me that when Rogan asked Peterson during the interview - and I paraphrase -

&gt;Ok, so you want to help out incels. But what about guys like Lebron James who's 6'5, good looking, athletic, successful, etc. and of course they're going to be successful with women? Why shouldn't they get to sleep around with women, assuming they're using contraception and ***not*** having illegitimate kids who will grow up without a father figure.

It really is no surprise to me then that Peterson was basically ***completely flustered*** for words and started babbling tangentially about equality of outcome / how hierarchies can sometimes implode on themselves / how feminists do have one or two reasonable points or something. ***Because he was talking about incels, so he doesn't have a good reason why they*** (I mean the worst of them, not the ones who can be redeemed) ***should get to pass on their genes for any fucking reason***\*\*\*.\*\*\*

And this is precisely what I mean - if you will look at my subreddit or take a look through my post history - when I repeatedly talk about how the discourse for Good Men has become limited. Usually I'm focussing on the limitations imposed by feminism but today I'm looking specifically at traditionalism. In this case the existence of black-pilled ideologies has completely derailed everyone from what matters - traditionalists, feminists everyone:

***we have a huge problem if GMs cannot survive to pass on their genes***

Duh! Intelligent social men need to live long enough to pass on their genes. *That's* the problem if Lebron James is fucking around all the time with no intention of passing on any of *his* good genes with any of these women and there are intelligent, good looking, worldly men with genuinely attractive, virtuous, authentic traits who are obstacled in dating because of some of the social pressures I made. And that's me being nice to the top percentage of men who are successful with scores of women - assuming they all have good genes to pass on. There are many of them who have machiavellian traits: anti-intellectualism, anti-social behaviours, misogyny, racism and sometimes even blatant sociopathy. ***These men don't have any difficulty overcoming the same social barriers I mentioned earlier because they have the ability to ""play the game"" almost remorselessly - maybe even sociopathically.*** And that is the reason there are so many GMs failing in dating.

And that brings me back to the topic of the OP:

&gt;I don't care if I am the Common Denominator, It's NOT My Fault that I'm Single

Seriously. When guys talk about how feminism have held them back, how night clubs are shit, how there is a severe shortage of places to meet women, how there are a small minority of men having sex with a significant proportion of men we're not just looking for excuses. Many of us have the field experience, the repeated rejections, the blood sweat and tears to back up what we're saying: we've tried, we've fucking tried and we can all attest to the fact that this dating environment holds us back.

So what is the solution to the problem so many of us GMs are having in dating. I'll give you a clue. It's not red pill machiavellian strategies that are designed to mimic the traits of some of the alpha male bad boys I described above. You can't fake that shit if you have anything vaguely resembling a conscience or sense of ethics. That's not for us otherwise we would not be GMs to begin with and the proof is in my own post history where I asked a question about [addressing the subjects of female history ](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/94ky9n/how_do_i_address_the_subjects_of_hypergamy_and/:)on [r/asktrp](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp). ***An endorsed contributor commented***:

&gt;You're still stuck thinking that society and culture has your best interests at heart and that you somehow owe society and culture a debt to be ""good"" and ""virtuous"". This is pure bluepill thinking, allowing external influences and popular culture to delineate your actions.This is why arguments about morality are not tolerated here... your morality is not mine is not Sleazy Steves...but since the definitions of what morality is best are asinine, also is using the term ""good"". What makes a ""good man""So stop spamming a redpill sub with your unrefined bluepill ideas.**... Wonder why your ""good guys"" can't get laid? Because they don't understand the reality of intersexual dynamics and refuse to play the game, instead espousing and perseverating on how things SHOULD be**, ala JBP. Refusal to acknowledge reality. See how that's the base issue?

*(As I said repeatedly in this post: we are not designed for this game. It is sick, twisted and Machiavellian in nature. If we were ever able to play this game and win, we would not be GMs in the first place. Conscience is not something you can just condition yourself out of, like the Red Pill naively assumes)*

This user added:

&gt;Hypergamy - women want to elevate themselves to the highest branch they can reach.Virtue plays exactly zero role in SMV, the criteria women use to determine which branch is higher. Just like ""nice"" or ""good"" these are known as container words because they sound nice, but every individual fill them up with the qualities specific to that individual, so they end up meaning nothing at all.**Your men are therefore displaying attributes that not only don't elevate their odds with women, but hinder them as you know the confident DNGAF ""asshole"" alpha is picked every time over a timid understanding communicative ""good guy"".**This is all TRP 101 stuff, it'll do you good to read the main TRP sidebar to start understanding this.

Furthermore, [As Jack Miller pointed out, prostitution and pressured monogamy are not the solution either.](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2018/06/11/the-wrong-way-to-deal-with-the-incel-phenomenon-and-ideas-for-a-better-way/)

I don't have perfect solutions either but in my opinion, we do need:

# A platform to discuss our views and raise awareness of our issues.

A platform such as [r/GoodMenGoodValues](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMenGoodValues) (but in real life) for reasonably minded GMs to have the conversations they want to have:

* the fact that there are so many GMs falling behind in the dating world now and what can be done about it
* what the problems are in this sort of society, and what it means for future generations if we cannot pass on intelligent &amp; virtuous genes
* what roles gender politics play in this
* the biological and social conditions of women that contribute to this
* our individual experiences and struggles in the dating world for which we should be able to refer to ourselves as Good Men and whatever virtuous or otherwise desirable traits we may have as it is useful background information
* the warning of the Big Question which is posed by post-wall hypergamous women, a fate that no woman wants to end up with when, after years of ignoring and neglecting Good Men, ridiculing us, calling us ""Nice GuysTM"", they turn around and ask ""but where have all the Good Men gone?"" ... the same GMs that already pursued and were rejected, often harshly by these same women, and the same self-respecting GMs that no longer want anything to do with these same women.

Without feminist or traditionalist derailing tactics such as the ones mentioned above or these gems right here:

* ""you're not a genuinely nice guy"" or ""Nice GuyTM!""
* ""it's not enough to just be nice!""
* ""you have covertly sexist attitudes""
* ""you need to man up""
* ""ethics have nothing to do with it""
* ""pull your boot straps up son, because the world doesn't owe you!""

Furthermore, we need to encourage the public to stop paying attention to incel terrorists and other individuals ***just because they have committed and extreme act***. This is another way the conversation GMs want to have has been derailed. Because we are not listened to - we are far too boring, far too sane, far too reasonable. Hey everyone - let's hear the damnatio memoriae instead: the Isla Vista Killer, the Torronto Killer, all of those other school shooters and spree killers. Who gives a fuck about boring, rationally-minded &amp; sane approaches, right?

# Intersectional-humanist systems of representation

(See this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntersecHumanism/comments/969g6i/what_are_intersectionalhumanist_ih_systems_of/) which explains about intersectional-humanism (IH)).

The only way to combat our feminist and traditionalist detractors is with a system of representation that can be seen as thorough and consistent unlike Modern Egalitarianism that has been hijacked. IH needs to be consistently anti-feminist, anti-traditionalist, anti-masculinist and to be taken seriously, it needs to develop into a real life form of activism that opposes all the insanity ***equally*** and also represents GMs from time to time.

# State funded tutelage for young men who did not learn certain life skills during their adolescence, mostly due to the failure of education system or their parents.

These fundamentals include the teaching adolescent and young men the following things from an early age:

* learning how to lift with correct form and compound lifts (squats, deadlifts, etc.)
* learning good fashion
* learning how to cook, change tires, drive a car, know basic DIY
* learning how to be financially prudent
* learning how to be career oriented (i.e. have direction for the future) - and potential support with this (qualifications, references, etc.)
* learning how to hold conversations with friends/family acquaintances as well as being able to talk to strangers

All of these things seem to make men more attractive in the eyes of women, and it also gives men the social confidence/awareness to approach women in a calibrated way.

Sometimes can't feel anything during sex?,"Okay first off I've had sex with 2 people in my life, one of them we did once let's call her y, and the other was my ex, call her x. 

So when I had sex with x, it was great and no problem whatsoever, we broke up and y, offered a fwb thing but only did it once, and it sucked. No pleasure at all, I was almost going to ask if it was in, I didn't feel much of anything. Went 2 hours and nothing at all, she said she was able to climax. Now I say my size is average. X and I plan on getting back together and talk some, hang out and I visit her in college, we have sex and it's fine. 

Now x and I were each other's first, and I knew y had probably done it many times before we did. But I know that's not really how things work so I'm not even really going to go there. 

But why would I feel pleasure from one person but not the other? And yes there was protection. ",OneY

When flaccid, I can pull my foreskin back all the way no problem, so it's all clean no smegma down there.  However when erect, the foreskin goes back till around halfway down the head. Should it go all the way down so it looks like an uncircumcised penis, head fully exposed?

Because of NiceGuysTM We Can't Discuss Our Problems in Dating,"Does anyone feel that because of the NiceGuysTM stereotype, it's affected genuinely good guys as well, even though the people who criticise the former always make out like it doesn't. For example, you could have a guy that:

\- is genuinely kind, empathetic, compassionate, etc. and therefore does not use acts of kindness to get into a woman's pants

\- has genuinely attractive qualities and therefore only seeks to date women of the same league

\- still struggles with dating

But because of [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys) and NiceGuyTM stereotyping, these guys can't talk about their struggles and also people will assume the worst about you: that you are a NiceGuyTM, that you are an ""incel"", that you are an NEET neckbeard, etc. All so that some people can have a cheap thrill out of making fun of some douchebags on the internet ([r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys) sub).

Who would like to see a discussion platform for good men with good values, where anti-nice guy logic is ripped apart, with screenshots, etc. Kind of like a reverse [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys) idea to prove to people (and yes, feminists) that there do indeed exist guys who:

\- is genuinely kind, empathetic, compassionate, etc. and therefore does not use acts of kindness to get into a woman's pants

\- has genuinely attractive qualities and therefore only seeks to date women of the same league

\- still struggles with dating

What's The Most You're Willing To Pay For Long-Term Reversible Birth Control?,"A simple question that may very well become more relevant in the coming years. Male birth control has been in development for years, but we're finally getting to a point where it will likely be available commercially very soon. However, as was the case with the birth control pill for women, chances are it's going to be expensive at first. Most new medical treatments are.

So how much is too much for long-term, reversible birth control? I'm not talking about a regular pill. Think in terms of an IUD or an implant. How much are you willing to pay for that kind of contraception that lasts at least five years and requires no daily pills?

Personally, the cap for me is $1,000. That's the most I could reasonably afford. I imagine that cap is different for others, but I think it's worth discussing.",OneY

Having trouble getting fully erect over the last few months (Please help!),"Hey reddit, (obviously throwaway)

I’m an 18 year old male who just graduated high school. Over the last few weeks/months I’ve noticed that my lil guy down there doesn’t get fully hard (length and girth) a lot of the time when it should get hard.

Sometimes it seems like it’s acting normally when I get morning wood or random boners here and there, but whenever it happens, it still isn’t fully enlarged.

I’m very concerned and since I’m only 18, I have no idea how to move forward and even talk to a doctor without the mortifying possibility of dealing with my parents.

A few months ago, when I was last sexually active with an actual human being, it worked fine but with the caveat that she noticed that my ejaculation was a bit clear.

I don’t know how long my ejaculation has been kind of clear and/or watery

Sometimes when it isn’t clear and looks normal, it kinda seems watery.

I notice that when I drink milk though, it seems to get better in ejaculation consistency.


Please help me!

"Does anyone else find this ""Big Dick Energy"" meme as stupid as me?","It's usage seems to have, rightfully, died off in the past few weeks but I still find it irritating that I didn't see it called out as being toxic more than it was. It felt like there was a week where all the popular media sites were writing daily articles about ""Big Dick Energy"" to try to force it into the American lexicon.

The common definition I saw was ""confidence without arrogance."" Which is just absurd to me: Being super confident in yourself because you have a big dick sounds like the definition of arrogance to me. I actually read an article that said that ""Big Dick Energy"" was the opposite of toxic masculinity. And of course this all implies that having ""Little Dick Energy"" is everything a man shouldn't be.

Everyone was quick to clarify that having ""Big Dick Energy"" wasn't exclusive to the male gender or the well-endowed. But then why not just say ""Energy"" or create a phrase that doesn't shame and exclude most men? It's like if people started saying ""That Brad Pitt has got some serious 'Intact Hymen Energy'"" or ""That Ariana Grande sure has a lot of 'Small Labia Energy.'"" You'd get your ass kicked online saying something like that.

I feel like it epitomizes how male insecurities are treated these days. As if the popular notion that confidence and masculinity are associated with having a big dick isn't as destructive, if not more so, to men's self esteem as the idea that dick size is important to sexual satisfaction. Like if we just say that dick size doesn't matter we can still use it as an insult or a barometer for male confidence.

Anyway, sorry if this came off really ranty. It feels good to be able to get it off my chest.

Edit: I hate to go on about this but just look at this piece from [Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/27/17506898/big-dick-energy-explained). They've just hit peak bullshit. It looks like it was written using markov chains.",OneY

"PSA: if you're about to comment to a man that he is short in height, don't.","For context, I work a maintenance job. It's outdoors, often hot and unbearable I typically have a lot of manual labor to do. That's fine, I signed up for the job and I'm more than physically capable of doing tasks I need to do. 

My height has nothing to do with it. 

Today at work, I'm trimming a bush, and I needed a pair of clippers that had a long handle so I could reach the top of it (I'm 5'7""). I'm minding my own business, and this tenant who lives at the apartment complex is watching me work. She gazes down from her second floor balcony and says to me, "" oh honey that's too tall for you, if only you were taller, I think you're too short for that *haha* . Its too bad you're not taller for that job"". I glared at her and continued to work, silently

Excuse me?

If I were to go up to someone and tell them they couldn't do a job well because they were a certain skin color, I'd probably get either shot (this is in a city) or there'd be some racism investigation. If I pointed out that someone were overweight people would be screaming ""BODY SHAMER!""

But for height? Nah. 

A man learns very on in life that ""sexy"" and ""good looking"" are constituted of being tall, muscular, and well groomed. My whole life I've been told both directly and indirectly that I'm inferior because I'm below average height. Listen, I don't need your sympathy, nor do I want your opinions of my proportions. Contrary to popular belief, you're NOT the first person to notice I'm below average height! WOW! 

I don't know the breakdown of men and women on this subreddit, but just know, that no short guy ever wants to hear this garbage. Its best to be the mature person and keep it to yourself.

 On top of that, most of my friends are girls and we've had jokes with each others tinder accounts. They usually get a ton of matches, whereas I get one a day at best. I'm not an unattractive guy, at uni this year, quite a few girls have often made the first move with me, I've had a long term girlfriend and let's just say uni's been fun haha.

Why is this my life?,"I don't know, man.

I'm the only responsible adult in a household with like 5 other adults and 2 kids and fucking everyone brought their fucking dogs when they all had to come stay at my house.

So my wife is pretty cool but there's a lot about her I'd change. I feel like an asshole cuz it's mostly superficial stuff like weight, her fucking facial hair and lack of moisturizer for her face/hands, which has made her look 10 years older than she should. But she doesn't care about that stuff. I usually don't care either but sometimes I look at GW and I think to myself ""god damn there are 31 year olds who have boobs like that??"" And I wonder why I've only had sex with one woman for the last 17 years. I dunno. She's a pretty good wife. I just wonder if I missed out on something awesome by never having sex with a skinny petite chick. My wife has always been a hefty lady. Not, like, obese. But always overweight. Still, a good lady though. 

My dad is a homeless drug addict but he's a generally cool dude and he's my dad and he wasn't always a homeless drug addict and he was always there for me so now I feel like I gotta be there for him but he's becoming a chore. I bought a single, individual ONE can of Pringles to share with my wife cuz we are trying to reduce our junk food intake. And I walk in my kitchen and my dad is standing over my Pringles can just putting them away, one after another. Dude we have ONE can that I bought as a treat for myself. It's CLEARLY not community food like a big box of cereal or 12 pack of soda. But I love my dad and I wanna help him. Even tho he brought his weird, literally crazy (schizoid) GF and their dog... Without asking even though I already have a dog and cat and maybe I didn't want another one.

Except that my stepdaughter and her boyfriend brought their 2 large dogs to my house and they currently roam around my back yard meaning that my dog is on a chain my front yard, which isn't fair to my dog, is it? Oh and they also brought their two kids, both of which are cool cuz they're little kids and you gotta love a goofy toddler. I know I do. And she's pregnant again cuz apparently when you have no job and no where to live, it's a great time to go having more babies that you can't support. But hell, they all just fall back on me. And my wife who is trying her best. Gotta give her credit. 

I work a full time job, a part time job and I'm in the National Guard. My wife has two part time jobs. She's at her night job right now instead of being in bed with me, all snuggled up.

Fuck we should be loaded. We make soooooo much more money than we need. But for some God damn reason, I'm always broke. My account is usually negative.

Stepdaughter just turned 19 and got upset that her mother and I only got her a $25 Starbucks card. Well shit I had to overdraw my bank account to buy it so I actually spent over $50 to buy the damn thing if that helps.

Fuck me, man. I worked really hard to join the National Guard at my age (old as shit). And I worked hard to finish my degree and get a good job. And I cook for my old dad 4-5 nights a week cuz if I don't he'd live off hot pockets which sounds kinda nice but he is diabetic and should have some vegetables.

So i don't get it. I'm supposed to be this rock. I quit doing meth 5 years ago and got my shit together. But days like today make me miss the days when I was a worthless meth addict that no one ever bothered asking for any favors.

I wish I had the fucking balls to drive my car off a cliff. But I'm a spineless pussy so I'll never do that.

Now excuse me while I spend the evening googling ""painless suicide methods"" in the hope that someone will see my search history and try to get me the help I desperately need but will never seek on my own cuz I don't know why.

Before I moved to Europe I lived with him in his home country for a month and met his family, got on really well with his parents etc. all goes well. When it finally comes time for me to move to Europe we decide to try and keep the relationship going.

I've been in Europe now for a couple of months and we were still going strong until last week... I start to notice that I seem to be the only one initiating contact.

If I talk about a famous man who I see think is a cool guy or doing something cool in the world, she'll talk about how she doesn't trust any men and say they *probably* have done this or she read about him doing something slightly un-PC on tumblr. She said something once and I tried to confront her about it saying ""that's pretty sexist you know"" and I was met with a reply along the lines of ""you *can't* be sexist to men, they're not a group that's discriminated against"", along with hooking that in with heterosexuals, white people and so on. Because of this response I was taken back, how did she possibly think this is logical? I simply couldn't debate because I dont even understand her logic. Can anybody figure out what I could say when she says something like this again as it makes me feel like SHIT but I don't wanna belittle feminism? 
(I fully agree with the idea that woman could/do have more problems than men (it just doesn't mean men have NO problems) and I even consider myself a feminist in the respect I believe equality can be achieved by focusing on woman's issues independently (feminism) and men's issues independently (I don't know what this is called) and I'm all for helping all sides of all groups of people.)

Disclaimer: I'm trying very hard to show how much I am for equality but it's hard to do that when you are in the typically ""not discriminated against"" group with somebody being horrible to you about the fact you're in that group. I truly am for equal rights and helping all people no matter the groups they belong to.

"The way I, as a man, have learned to communicate has left me lost and confused.","I would say that I am good at expressing myself emotionally, and I have healthy perspectives on relationships with partners, with friends and with strangers. I know how to formulate myself properly, and I know how to tell someone if I feel uncomfortable with anything in a productive, non\-aggressive manner.

The problem then comes to the point that I feel as if I have never learned 'proper' communication when I was young. I had close male friends, but we rarely talked much about anything of worth, from what I can remember. And I don't see that playing games and sports is wrong, but I feel as if \- when I think back \- something was lacking that I could have used now.

One of the factors that I feel insecure and lost, and this is not putting blame on anyone but rather explaining where it comes from, is that I see how Women talk to each other, and how they communicate entirely differently from men.

  
[https://psychcentral.com/blog/6\-ways\-men\-and\-women\-communicate\-differently/](https://psychcentral.com/blog/6-ways-men-and-women-communicate-differently/)

\(\(The link is just an example, I can't verify that its 100&amp;#37; scientifically accurate\)\)

The range of things they can and will talk about. When I am with women and they talk, I can find myself becoming silent, even if it is interesting subjects, because I don't know what to say.

My dad is somewhat the same, he has his building projects to talk about, but in larger conversations he just listens and laughs when it is funny. He rarely discuss or talk about 'more important' matters.

Men that I know and have met don't talk as much about important matters, or personal matters as much as women do, and not in the same relaxed manner either. That may just be the men I've met personally, but the exceptions for me are few and far between.

I want to establish, and develop friendships with people. Strangers and old friends alike, but I don't really know how to start, or how to continue. I feel insecure and I am afraid to tell anyone, and I don't want my conversations or relationships to be about my insecurities.

This may just be me rambling, but I want to vent and see if anyone else has the same experience, from the perspective of a man.  


TLDR: I envy the easy way women can talk to each other on a seemingly deeper level, that I didn't learn/was born with, and I struggle to develop friendships further.",OneY
"Seeking advice about a weird topic: how to feel when you are gay and cannot have children yourself, and are an only child","Hey guys, I hope this is an appropriate space for this question, I wasn't sure where to turn. I have a close friend who is too embarrassed to ask this himself, and he was talking to me about his feelings on reproduction. He comes from a country where being gay is really taboo, and he is sure he is gay, having tried very hard to be straight for many years. So, he is an only child, and he hates the fact that he can't have kids.

His parents put a lot of pressure on him to get married and have kids so ""their line won't end"", but he can't have kids himself (duh) and he can't marry a woman and be happy or make her happy... I have already said he probably should see a therapist, but he won't. He feels so bad about this, that sometimes it makes him think he was supposed to be a woman, and he was cheated or something. He has body dysphoria sometimes, and wishes he could be a woman.

What do I say to him? How do I comfort someone who is in a situation like this? I want to say fuck what your parents think, you should be proud of who you are, and they should too, but I can understand wanting grandkids and all. Anyway, I didn't know where to go for a question like this, so I hope I am ok to ask it here. Thanks for any advice or perspectives you have on this!!",OneY

"Marriage, mental health, and emotional cheating","I’ll get righty into it. I’ve been married for seven years. My [29M] wife [26F] have had a lot of ups and downs over the years and been near divorce at least four or five times. About five years ago our relationship essentially died and I’ve been keeping it together for our child [4F]. I really don’t love my wife anymore and it sucks a lot trying to maintain a relationship that has no passion. In the past year it’s gotten particularly bad and a last week I finally had a sit down with my wife where I told her I didn’t love her anymore and that we should probably get divorced because our relationship is terrible and it hurts us both. She wasn’t interested in ending our marriage and we wound up going on a trip without our daughter to try and rekindle something out of our marriage. I don’t know how it went for her because I haven’t talked to her about this yet, but it’s just as bad for me as always and I’m miserable.

I’ve dealt with depression for most of my life and only about six months ago started getting medicated for it. Things were going well for a while on medication then it stopped working so I had my dosage upped and that was fine for about a week and then it slowly stopped working till about two weeks ago when it was no longer working at all and now I’m having manic episodes and generally feeling catatonic. I’m seeing my psychiatrist again tomorrow for an emergency appointment to try and get that shit sorted out.

A few weeks ago completely out of the blue a girl I dated when I was 17 sent me a friend request on Snapchat. I’d been talking to her back and forth a bit catching up and seeing how she’s been and I realized I’d never stopped being in love with this girl. I’d been thinking about her for years. She was like the one that got away for me. Initially I was trying to have platonic, pleasant conversations with her and I quickly found myself not doing that. Eventually I decided to talk to her about how I’d been feeling and that seems to have made her not want to talk to me anymore which is more good than bad and now I’m in gut wrenching emotional pain.

So all of this is coming together at the same time with the dead marriage and cheating being mostly related and the crippling depression and apparently mania being conveniently along for the ride. I don’t have any questions, but I wanted to talk to someone about this because I’m losing my mind and I have no idea what to do other than just deal with it.",OneY
Rant/Frustration,"So me and my girlfriend have been ""on the steady"" for 6 months now. She's never had a ""real"" relationship before, ( a few here and there boyfriends, but none of them lasted longer than a month, and none of them really treated her with kindness or respect) so this is all new to her. I, on the other hand, have had 2 2+ year long relationships. With said relationships, physically, we got pretty far obviously. Current girlfriend has not done anything physical at all. I have no problem with waiting for her to be comfortable with these things, obviously that would be terrible if I pressured her into anything. (we frequently have check-ins to make sure I'm not doing anything she isn't comfortable with, I'm only SLIGHTLY [*sarcasm*]  paranoid about crossing her lines) I've just reached the point where I feel like something is wrong with me. She assuresme that she is attracted to me, and maybe it's just me being crazy, but nothing happens. Ever. Every time we make out, I initiate it, and every time I ask for more, she just says "" not yet"". She's never tried to do anything new, I basically have to ask repeatedly (as in, different sessions, not continuing to ask after she's said no) until she says yes. Am I crazy for thinking she's not attracted to me? Does she just need more time? I don't know. I don't think I'm a ugly guy, and I'm decently built, I just don't know why she's not comfortable with so much. And it's not like she isn't comfortable with me, she literally is my best friend. We were best friends before we even started dating. I just don't know how to handle feeling like she's never going to want anything physical beyond kissing me.

"Help, I've done a transgression and want to grow from it","tw: sexual coercion

I was in a relationship, and was messing around with my partner who had told me their past traumas. We were making out, all the good stuff and then I fucked up . I attempted to play with her vagina from the outside, and continually would hear ""let's not do it now"" or ""no"", stop and keep attempting to go again. Eventually, I ended up stopping and we went to cuddle and I prompted her to attempt to jerk me off, and she went to a traumatic shock because she had been sexually assaulted at a party in the past. I've hurt her dearly, she understands it wasn't out of malintent and have apologized but made her go through some emotional labour of explaining her pain to me and due to the inclusion of someother people \(my friends committed a hate crime against me in response\) she still has to deal with me. I still care for her deeply but I realize I've done a huge mistake. I keep trying to figure out what to do with my life now, she feels that \(and is right\) I've sexually assaulted her, and is going through a lot of pain to heal.

I wish I was allowed to just do this when I'm pissed but it's not a fucking option for me. I have to tough it out. I have to fight through the bullshit and put up with being kicked around because my family is so reliant on my income.

Oh, but trust me, we are reliant on her income too. She works part-time so it's not as significant, but she earns probably 25% of our income. Well, she used to until today when she decided she had enough of her boss.

Technically, we will probably be okay financially cuz she is signed up with a day-labor place and can get back to earning money by tomorrow if she wants. So it's not like she'll be unemployed for long.

I just feel like there's a right way to leave a shitty job and walking out in anger due to a write up probably isn't it.

[rant/vent/need support] My gf of 6 years left me and I never felt this bad," I'm writing here because I hope I'll find some support from fellow sensible mans and I don't need the drama of [r/relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships). Also using a throwaway because reasons.So 3 months ago my gf left me after 6 years, we were going trough a rough time on our personal lives, we had some ups and downs but we always managed to recover. This time it wasn't the same.

I was a trainwreck, I thought multiple times of ending it all, started having panic attacks, it felt like anything had a meaning. Eventually with support from friends I got better and went in therapy, I discovered I was slowly going in depression while I was with her, and it was the reason she left me, I wasn't the same guy she felt in love with.

After a month we saw each other at a mutual friend's party and I spoke with her before leaving, she told me she could tell I was different, that she liked me. I asked her to think about if she wanted to try again with me.

I didn't heard from her for more or less another week, then on the day it would have been our anniversary I wrote her a message thanking her for all the time we spent together and what we did \(it was more than this but it's really personal\), one hour later she told me she was waiting for me outside, I was scared as fuck, I was scared she would tell me to stay away and not bother her.

Boys I was wrong, she wanted to go back!! I felt like god, I never felt that happy and complete, we talked a lot about us, what we were, what happened, what we changed and what we would do. I went to bed that night and slept like a baby.

The following days it was a dream, we saw each other a lot, and I have no words for how happy I was.

Then, one week later from the day she got back, something changed, she was more distant, barely speaking, it felt like we were back when she left me, I confronted her and she said she wasn't feeling for me what she was supposed and wanted to feel, that she wasn't sure of what we were doing. Basically she left me another time.

I'm a trainwreck now, we didn't broke up fighting or anything so it happened that we both were present when we went out with mutual friends, sometimes she writes me but it's nothing serious.

Now the thing is, I can't move on, even if I was the first asking her to come back before I was fully aware that it could not go as I wished, and I was ready trying to go out with someone else. Now I'm constantly thinking about her, the other day I was ready asking a girl out but just a second before I tried I felt bad. Generally I feel really demotivated and always tired. I'd stay in bed all day long if I don't force me to get out.",OneY

How Much Chest Hair Is Too Much?,"I thought I'd pose this question because it's one I'll have to answer fairly soon. I come from a family where the men tend to get pretty hairy as they get older.

the truth about penis size and the big cope,"is how no one takes the feeling of inadequacy seriously. surely it must be the porn, surely it must just be men being men and getting overly insecure over tiny shit but no, it can't be the fact that women express their preference for big dicks very vocaly or even better, it can't be that those men did not fall on their head, they know exactly how much women lie to either not be perceived as shallow or comfort men, we have these things all the time, looks don't matter, height does not matter, status does not matter.. but at the end of the day it actually turns out that yes, all of those things matter a great big deal. nd just from a mechanical purely anatomical perspective, of course a bigger thicker penis is going to feel better, of course it is going to cause more friction and of course it will be visually much more appealing than a small shit, all important parts of actual sex.


and you can even read it's level of importance out of them saying that it does not matter. just do oral (a proof that size matters) use toys(another proof) just compensate for it(yes another one) and the most beautiful of all of them, of what use is a big dick if he does not know how to use them, implying that if he does ofc big is better and since it is something not of any complexity that no one could ever learn it if they are not mentally retarded that argument is off the table too.
too big and it hurts is another beauty. well, no shit a horse cock is going to hurt but this contributes nothing to the argument.


so you have to wonder, seriously? we are insecure because of the porn? just going to a place like the more sex positive subreddits is going to give anyone a bigger complex than watching 24h of porn for a year. hearing actual women talk about their experience is going to be worse than watching any amount of porn. and another beauty, the ones that say ""small is alright"", they are not talking about us(I'm 4.5*4), they are talking about 5-5.5 with good girth. that's the thing just with height when people talk about the short guy they would not mind dating, he is not 5'4 or 5'3, no h is 5'8 or 9. it's the same pattern over and over again.



and the worst of it is, it's probably fine. there si nothing inherently wrong with having a preference or a requirement when it comes to sexual pleasure. we would probably prefer bigger dicks too, hell we do so now because and that is often left out, bigger dicks are also more pleasurable for the guy. bigger girth means more pleasure, more friction, longer means being able to actual thrust, actually do a bunch of positions apart from the retarded ones. I think size also matters for the pleasure of the guy as if it were not completely obvious.
I mean think about what people are saying at the end of the day and how emasculating it is. perhaps men do put a lot of value into piv, because it's a great thing, the ultimate thing and when someone tells you that your tool is not going to cut it(and that's basically what all the compensation stuff is going to apply) it really DOES meant that you have a worthless tool. it really does mean that a certain part of your sex life is going to be nonexistent at least in a satisfying form. and that's quite a pill to swallow, how could someone not take this seriously?


and that's something one simply has to deal with. apart from when you actually do get insecure which would be totally understandable with all what I have played out here you are actually getting attacked even more when you express your insecurity. because you are not men enough to eat shit, to just eat it and stop talking about it. because for men insecurity makes you less attractive but you have to ask what difference does it really make at this point?


I don't think people are taking this seriously enough and the blame is too often being put on the man who is understandably insecure and at times devastated about it. because it really does matter quite a bit


*most women prefer above average to well above average (if they are actually being honest about it, in posts like these they never actually speak up so people jump to the conclusion that it is not a thing, the next red herring.) with average being fine, no one talks about actually small guys and how their size actually becomes an inpairment that cannot be compensated for with being particularly skilled either because well, there is simply no sensation. *ironically to comfort those average guys they say „as long as it is average.. smaller than that would indeed be a problem uh“*it‘s an entire new level, take the issues of guys conplaiking about being average and multiply them by ten. positions dont work and the ones that do become ultimately very boring after a short amount of time and even with th the pleqsure is not particularly exciting. you bqsically have to live with the idea that you have literally not been built for sex(actual sex not just some yada yada oral use your hands toys bullshit, men and women want to and ejoy having actual sex) and that you dick is basically worthless, which it is, saying „compensate with this and that“ and „some just dont care about piv“ is ironically the greqtest proof of it being kind of a big deal. no one tqkes it seriously, people laugh at it, people attribute small dick syndrome to people they hate like donald trump(must have a small dick HA) and then they attribute they well understandable insecurity to men themselves, to their porn consumption(which has never done anything to me, most people are not retarded wnough to believe anything about porn is close to reality, people are not that stupid although some average guys are it seems)*

furthermore it seems to me that most of the pressure when it comes to sex, to actually be good in the act falls on men. there might be a little confirmation bias involved in this but certainly the biggest focus lies on the man, his stamina and technique and his size and tool. 

I am so sick off it and my body and people comparing me to some incel because they heard the word in the knews and are not capeable of forming their own opinion. anyway a good analogy would be „it‘s not the size of the boat but the motion of the ocean but you sure as hell are not going to get far with a raft trying to cross the atlantic.",OneY

My father never payed attention to me and in turn I picked up some bad traits.,"I was reading a post earlier about father's finding out that their kid isn't theirs, and a lot of the comments talked about finding out that their father wasn't their bilogical parent, yet the father still did a great job and was a great father figure. 

It made me realize how important having a father figure in your life means. Something I never really ever thought about. It would seem that I missed out on a lot of learning and instead picked up a bunch of terrible traits after trying to get my father to notice or pay attention to me.

Wish someone would have told my dad about being a good father figure like that when I was younger. He was too busy sleeping with other woman while I was forced to walk around outside the house of whichever chick he met that weekend in a unfamiliar area with my younger brother in tow, usually over 40 clicks away from my mother. Every. Single. Weekend. I never got to have sleepovers, go to friend birthday parties or even hangout with school friends on the weekend, he refused to let me stay with my mother and wouldn't drive to come pick me up forcing my mother to drive out. 

I think he's taking parenting and his new marriage seriously now and doing this with his new family though. So lucky for them I guess.  

I lucked out and found the perfect partner (On tinder of all places) who has helped me reprogram these traits, and I will treasure her forever. 5 years strong and no end in sight!

I'm having a lot of issues with my virginity,"I'm 21 and in university. I know that there's plenty of people my age and older that are still virgins, but that sentiment doesn't really make me feel any better about where I'm at. I have a strong sex drive and I really crave some form of sexual intimacy. The problem is I'm a very shy and neurotic person and I have trouble communicating confidence and interest when I'm around women I'm interested in. I was bullied a lot (especially by girls) growing up because of my timid and conflict avoidant nature. I've found those experiences have left me with a lot of problems with myself and other people.

 Recently I had been seeing a girl I met on tinder. We hung out and cuddled watching movies a few times. Every time I'd try to move forward, she'd shut me down saying she wanted to wait a while to go anywhere because she wasn't over her ex. I know, red flag, but I was desperate as fuck for someone to pay attention to me.

 So yesterday she invited me over to hang, she goes to take a shower and tells me to wait in her room. So stupid me thinks this is going somewhere. When she comes back she asks me to help her get ready for the date she's going on. Not with me mind you. She then told me she knew I was a virgin (I never told her), and she had a rule about not dating or sleeping with virgins. I felt so worthless in that moment. I just kind of kept my mouth shut and acted like everything was fine, but it hurt. I thought I liked her a lot and that this was going somewhere.

Today I feel led on and pathetic. This isn't the first time something like this has happened to me. That means that the problem fundamentally lies with me.

My night is terrible.,"I'm a guy who was just blown by two women who he *really* didn't want to get blown by. I feel like no real man would ever even have those words come out of his mouth...this isn't some sort of 15 year old humble-brag, I actually feel like shit. What's worse is that another friend of mine is apparently pretty livid about the whole situation, but I can't ask her why because she wont respond to my texts. I really value that friendship...I don't want to lose it just because I stopped resisting and let two people do what they wanted with me after I said no and pulled up my pants 20 times. I got too drunk, and a sober me would have had the reasoning to just walk away, so I take full responsibility and I wont call it sexual assault or rape or anything.

Can anyone relate? How did you feel better about it? Do you have any advice? I just need a bit of support right now I guess.",OneY

A friend is facing revenge porn charges after getting hacked. Let's all take a moment to protect our ex's and partners!,"A friend of mine recently had some kind of data loss event which affected his online banking, and a couple of his social media accounts. Additionally I think he had some vids or photos of an ex  on a drive somewhere which was also somehow accessed. Anyway his ex found those photos online and has decided that this was a deliberate/reckless action on his part (not here to debate the merits of the victim here) and is pursuing legal recourse against him. 

Some of us may have old photos/vids of an ex stored somewhere on a drive somewhere in our house. Maybe you need to go back and delete those files, if you feel you're no longer entitled to keep them. Or at the very least go out of your way to encrypt them so they cannot be accessed easily. A simple password protected zip file will protect yourself and your Ex's from a great deal of heartache and strife. I know my friend is pretty devastated because he still has feelings for this woman but let this be a cautionary tale to all of us.",OneY

I don‘t want to but I feel like I will always be miserable about it,"
I can‘t even grasp how amazing it must be to live life not being discouraged ecery single day bc of your height. I get up every morning and I hate myself. actually I dont really hate myself as a person but I truly hate the way I am, my height and the situation around it.


—


so I get up and go to the train only to be towered over by a fucking school class. these people were like what, 13 years old? at this point my day is basically ruined. I cant help it, it‘s this void that just pulls my down and drags my mood to absolute zero. then I arrive at work and I‘m by far the shortest (person!) I can find. in conferences having to stand next to other people is literal torture for me. in these situations I really want to sink into the ground. it‘s just not fun or enjoyable anymore, in fact it never was. so then when work is completed I go hime. that‘s it, my life for the last 6 years. I don‘t enjoy going outside anymore, I hate this insanely strong feeling if inadequacy. I am not just a short guy, I am THE short guy.



—



believe it or not but I have not seen a man my age my height or shorter in 2018. it‘s absolutely insane and I have said it numerous times, I would have no issue with being normal short. I am not though, I feel like a freak. and I look like a freak with my small frame and my tiny arms and my slim shoulders. I hate it.


—




and I know what other people think of it. I know what women think of it, if it‘s closely related to what I think about fat women, as in, being friends is a no brainer, why not if they are nice people but sexual attraction? oh god, no. if it‘s just related to that then I am fucked. I sometimes try to comfort myself in thinking that maybe it‘s not like that, maybe other people don‘t see being short the way I see it. but that is evidently wishful thinking and I know that very well based in personal experience.
—



I feel so pathetic seeing other people enjoying their lives to the fullest, having families, people who went to school with me outperforming me in every way possible. feeling comfortable in their skins. but it‘s not just that, it‘s that they dont have a reason to feel uncomfortable.
—
when I walk around I feel like an outcast. I feel like other people are not even playing the same game, it‘s lile a swimming race between michael phelps and my grandmother. hell, in these meetings I feel like a different species.



—



and when I compare myself to other people, to other men, it‘s so perfectly clear why no one who is not desperate would not want to date ne. there are people just as funny, just as successful but without being so incredibly short. it really hurts, seriously.



—



my youth, my childhood, everything I have done has been influenced by my height in some way. from the age of 15 when I first got rejected for it in a rather brutal way, which totally opened my eyes to double that age. college was terrible and I look back at it with lots of grief, I was anxious as fuck with good reason.



—
I don‘t have a true friend who I could share this with. I feel so pathetic and it‘s a mixture of my own failure to get my life in order and the fact that I am so short. even if I did get it in order(the best years are completely wasted at this point) I am still 5‘4. and every morning I am reminded of it, from getting up to getting to work to being at work feeling emasculated and unable to attract anyone. I am serious this is my life and this is why I have so much time for reddit. I am not proud of it, I dont mean to discourage anyone, especially young ones(which I have been accused if) but I cannot help it.",OneY

On hyper-agency and how it hurts us men,"I find that **Hyper-agency** is one of the most hurtful things in society that we men are facing.

We're always supposed to do the right thing; always supposed to know what to do and have no fear in doing it. Always supposed to be able to suppress our emotions and rule them, rather than the other way around. Always supposed to be the most mature we can be.

Whenever we suffer, it is never the fault of some system; the blame always lies with ourselves. Everything is our responsibility. Wherever we are victims, we are victims only of ourselves.

How does this influence the way we view our own problems?

There's something called [Ozy's Law](https://goodmenproject.com/noseriouslywhatabouttehmenz/ozys-law/), which says that **misogyny mirrors misandry**. That is to say, every instance of sexism against women comes with a similar, mirrored instance of sexism against men. These two sides are rarely commensurate -- women often have it worse -- but the two sides are always both there.

- Women are often approached by 'creeps'? Men are the ones who have to reach out, and are never taught how.
- Women suffer from their bodies' overt sexualisation in media? Men suffer from our lack of sexualisation, leading us to believe that our bodies could never be seen as sexy, as desirable.
- Feminine attributes are seen as weak? Then men may never exhibit them.
- Sex devalues women, making us think sluts are terrible people? Then sex is men's measure of worth, and male virgins become worthless.
- Women are viewed as being excessively emotional, of being slaves to their emotions? Then men must remain the masters of theirs.
- Women are viewed as having little agency, so we do not trust that they may be capable? Then men are viewed as having hyper-agency, and we are never allowed to be weak, to fail.

What do these examples have to do with hyper-agency?

They show that when the sexism is against women, it is clear that the system is at fault; but when the sexism is against men, it is seen as being the fault of being individual men's actions or expectations. It is then men who are told that they *themselves* have to change. After all, when we have such incredible hyper-agency, aren't all of our issues our own responsibility?",OneY

Ex-girlfriend is pregnant... help.,"Hey everyone, sorry to throw up here, but, too late!

I broke up with my now Ex-girlfriend about a month and a half ago, left on a trip, then got a facebook message about 2 weeks ago learning she was pregnant.

I don't know if it's my kid. We've been hanging out and talking but...

I'm only 22. She has no interest in getting an abortion.

I was supposed to finally be free but now I feel pressured to be with her/get married. Her whole family is catholic...

I've been on and off depressed and having suicidal thoughts the last week. Nothing serious, but man, I am in a bad place now...

Really just want to hear a bunch of different opinions on what I should/could do... I've been thinking a lot but I want to hear any options you all might have. She says she's ready to be a single parent but I can't really imagine living a peaceful life knowing that somewhere is my child being raised without me...

I really don't want to be with the mother. She's very pretty and really a great woman, but I have moved on from her. Going back to her feels like the wrong thing to do. Like a divorce in waiting...

So conflicted... Please OneY, throw me some ideas!

I'll spare the nitty gritty because who wants to hear about a dude jerking it. I fucking ejaculated/came/jizzed properly. For the first time in my life at 19 years old.

The problem seemed to be that I was *afraid* or *hesitant* to masturbate myself to orgasm. I always perceived the shaft/glans sensitivity and slight pain (from my hand causing friction) as a reason for concern. Tonight, I just ignored it and went beyond that + changed the way I stroked. Everything about it indicated normalcy.

Top Mistakes Men Make With Their Online Dating Photos,"For the record, I am not saying women are not guilty of making such mistake but from my experience as as online dating photographer, I have noticed these mistakes men are more likely to make on their online dating profile. Here are some tips to avoid hurting your chances at more right swipes.

**Shirtless photos**. There is nothing wrong with shirtless photos of you, at the beach but in a club, at the gym, or some other non-tropical, non-hot tub environment should be avoided.
Blurry photos or photos taken from a distance. Just because you love your epic photo from some outdoor adventure (on top of a mountain top, top of the ski slope, jumping from a waterfall etc.) doesn’t mean women will love them — this is especially true if your face is not visible or if it is too blurry.

**Photos with exes or women (cropped out or not)**. If it is a photo with your mom, sister or close friend — say so. Otherwise find another photo.

**Drunk photos**. Chances are you have a photo from college, bachelor party or some other shenanigans. Typically these are not flattering. You look more lethargic, heavier in drunk photos. Stay clear.

**Sunglasses**. Are you trying to look cool? Are you trying to hide your face? Unless you are at the beach or at the park on a sunny day, keep these photos to a minimum — of 1 or better yet avoid altogether. Women love to see what you look like but if you have sunglasses in your photos, it might seem like you are trying to hide something.

**Gym selfies.** Well actually all selfies in general. Nothing communicates vanity and a need for attention more than gym selfies (except maybe gym bathroom selfies). Just say no to selfies.

**Not smiling**. This seems super obvious but this is perhaps the biggest mistake men make. As an online dating photographer I have to remind potential clients that these photos are used to market yourself — these are not DMV photos nor are they gang photos to show how tough you think you are. Smiling is the number one request I get from women for photos I take of the male clients.

**Looking away**. I know many of the Tinder articles in the news suggest turning to the side but I highly suggest you don’t. If you happen to have one candid photo you love that happens to look away — fine but if you have several photos looking away then it signals you are shy, have concerns over privacy, are trying to hard to look cool or have something on the side of your face you are trying to hide.

**Bad posture**. Yes, you cannot expect a photo of you sitting on a couch or somewhere passively will be effective at attracting women. You have to seem interesting, creative and charming. Sitting lethargically with your belly hanging out or slouching is not a good look. Use good posture but be sure to relax so you don’t come off looking like a robot.

"Becoming A Man vs Working on Womanhood, What are the communities thoughts?","Theres a headline in the sub for participating in a research project and I think its fantastic, I just bring it up because in it the Op mentions that you can have your gift card donated to ""Becoming A Man"" and it had been a few years since I had read about them and thought Id load them back up and see how things were going.

That organization's run-down is [here](http://www.youth-guidance.org/bam/).

Maybe Im too sensitive (most likely) but it troubles me a little bit that the measure for success of this program is through a study from the University of Chicago's Crime Lab, participants are much less likely to commit crime (particularly violent crime) and therefore the program is a success because it saves the system so much money in future incarceration costs.

I mean yes...thats lovely that we are saving money...but its weird that its not a measured success because this many more men achieve something or gain greater life satisfaction etc.  What I mean is the positive study mentioned is because its good for society, not because its good for men.  It irks me a little for that reason but also because, What if its the case that one of the major hurdles facing these men, most likely minority men, is the perception that they are more prone to violent crime.  Arent we kind of reinforcing that bullshit by saying, ""See, look how much less violent this program makes them?""  This is minor but it irks me.  Personally I would not have listed it.  I would have focused on the success stories, which they are there also!

Secondly, it also irks me a little bit more that one of the core values (there are six), one of the six is:

&gt; Respect for Womanhood:  I learn how my words and actions devalue women, including those I love.  I am more mindful and respectful in how I interact with women. I strive to be a self-liberator and not an oppressor.

I would have said ""Respect for Myself"" there is nothing inherently more respect-worthy in women than in anyone else.  Everyone should be given a modicum of respect but above that respect is earned.  This admission feels to me like a group that gets together to help men can only do so with big feminism's seal of approval and it can only do that if its going to include some kind of ideological bullshit like women are oppressed and men need to stop oppressing them.  I mean these are inner-city kids for fuck's sake, by oppress-ability points they're not even on the scale.

Theres also a core value about taking responsibility for one's actions.  I agree with that one.  I include it here because its not included elsewhere which is also odd to me.

Now the women's program can be found here:  https://www.youth-guidance.org/wow/

It has no study from the crime lab about how much money society is saving from not having to incarcerate this many more violent offenders.  Which is good, its good to see a program be justifiable because it helps people.

Theres also no core value about treating men with respect.  Nor is there a core value for taking responsibility for one's actions.

Honestly the core values for Working on Womanhood sound more like cheerleading camp.  Which again....this isnt my program...Im just making commentary.

Finally, it is probably a little offensive to say but I cant help but feel like many (honestly all) of the activities and lessons that BAM is teaching are things that traditionally a father or a role model would have taught.  I read the available studies and at no point is this ever mentioned.  What are your thoughts?

So again Im not looking to downplay what they are doing (which I support, I think its fantastic) and I grant I am being nitpicky but honestly its just to discuss and hear what other's think.",OneY

Nothing about masculinity is about school shootings, and if you think it is, then you are part of the problem.  If you are telling other people that masculinity is so horrid that it drives you to murder 17 people then you are the issue.  The man who stood in front of the door to protect those students, he is masculine.  What boys need is a safe space from our culture telling them that they are already monsters because of whats between their legs.

[18M] I don't believe I've ever achieved an orgasm/came via masturbation. What could be wrong with me?,"Whenever I'm erect and try to masturbate, the most that comes out is what I believe to be pre-ejaculate. It's clear, not all that thick, and there's not a lot of it. I have been this way my entire life, and due to me approaching the age of 19 soon + having a girlfriend, I'm beginning to get concerned.

Just a few things:

* I'm a virgin. 

* I look at porn semi-often, but I don't masturbate every time I look at it. Most porn in general has gotten boring to me.

* The act of masturbating itself doesn't actually strike me as **that pleasurable**; doing it with my bare hands doesn't yield any *out-of-this-world* experience. I've never used any sort of lubricant or lotion in the process, so that could be why?

* Throughout my teenage years, and still, I've experienced depression, apathy, and just a lack of ambition.

* The penis itself gets sensitive and slightly sore after pre-cum.

* The pre-cum is clear and while not *extremely* watery, I wouldn't describe it as viscous by any means. 

* I've had wet dreams in the past, which actually seem to be more intense than my conscious acts of self-pleasure. No verdict on whether or not the fluid discharged was semen or not.

* My diet is inconsistent and poor, but I am of average weight.

Ask questions if needed. 

For those that will advise me to see a doctor: **I'm not insured right now and I don't have the money for it, otherwise I would**. 

To anyone in a similar situation or that was in a similar situation: I'd greatly appreciate it if you could provide insight!

---------------------------------

The only thing I can imagine is that the diet, depression, and lack of pleasure is causing this?

My penis can’t stay hard,"Hello everyone I’m 15 years old now and I have a healthy penis, no serious problems yet or whatsoever.

Yesterday I was left hard for a long time after constantly looking at pictures of girls on my phone and it really was bad. I kept precumming and I couldn’t stop. 

I was not able to masturbate at the moment, so this kept repeating. This happened like every 3 minutes I checked my pants for the first 12 minutes and it’s because I couldn’t masturbate.

But now tonight, I got home and I masturbated but had a rough time trying to ejaculate because there was precum always coming up every 2 minutes and I have to wipe it off with a towel.

Due to this I masturbated for 11 minutes? “Very long for me.” And it was terrible. It didn’t feel as good. But I did ejaculate after I was done. I then stayed hard after ejaculation for a phew minutes but I did not masturbate. 

So later that night if I remember I got a bit of Castor Oil and applied it to my ppp but this time I only used castor oil and no tree oil mixed. I took a small nap at 6 pm and woke up at 8 pm. I woke up with a boner so I went to masturbate.. again. But to my surprise I noticed it was a little softer than usually and It took some more time for me to ejaculate as well.

Now the between of my scrotum and anus there is no swelling but when I push in, it feels sore. I push in with my two fingers (left hand) please tell me what’s wrong with me and how this can be stopped. I feel like going to the doctor. I’ve never had any problems like this ever before but it’s really unfortunate.

Also: I barely ate yesterday and only ate two meals, breakfast and dinner after I masturbated and dinner was at 6 pm or something.

TL;DR Can your penis take time to regenerate after masturbation? Do I have anything serious?",OneY

CLEAN YOUR TOILET! or learn the hard way like i did.,"Being a 21 year old bachelor on his own, it can be really easy to doze off and put off adulthood responsibilities.

I was using the restroom and my tip accidentally touched the bowl i hadn't cleaned in 6-10 weeks, (i clean the seat very often and rim, just not the bowl and i can get away with a lot since i'm the only person that uses it.).

I didn't think much at the time just
 ""oh shit...oh well i've never gotten an infection and this isn't the first time it's happened"".

Only to later have my tip hurt, then my legs go numb, then my balls feel heavy, (i pissed clean, came clean, and didn't have any blood) each day a symptom would go away and a different one would come up, i was terrified  after i read mayoclinic and jumped to the conclusion i may be dealing with testicular cancer, as cancer runs in my family and was scared shitless.

The days have been getting easier and today i bit the bullet and got a UTI tester from the store, tested super positive and i'll be getting antibiotics soon, and cleaned the fuck out of the bowl till my fingers fell off.

Don't be lazy, don't put yourself through a scare like me. (It also sucks i couldn't jerk it or had a funny walk from pain)

TL;DR: got a UTI from a dirty bowl, clean your bowl and don't get a scare or inconvenience yourself.

Possible meatus problems and solutions?,"Hello everyone, I’m 14 years old and I’m having a phew minor issues with my meatus.

So I was wondering if there was any more people that suffer with this problem, and that is well having a larger meatus than usually.

My puberty like times: I started to masturbate, there was no pain or anything. But as I started to urinate while ages 11-13 My meatus would burn as if it was stabbed by a knife!!! I could not push hard to urinate and let it spurt out. I could only push slowly until a small amount of urine flowed out, then push hard. (Normal peeing push)

This went on for at least a year. I then had problems urinating and would have to been down to pee all the time. When I wore my boxers my meatus would feel a small burn by it. The inside of the top head skin. 

I stopped wiggling my penis after peeing and instead proceeded to wipe the meatus with tissue at the ages 11-13 and so up. Now sometimes when I masturbate my meatus skin is a very reddish-pinkish after ejaculation. 

TL;DR Could my meatus possible by inflamed? Are there any treatments for guys with an inflamed meatus? ",OneY
Argument derailed with girlfriends friend because she said I was less compassionate because I was a man.,"Venting here. 

Bill C-16 in Canada was passed, which is an amendment to the human rights code protecting gender expression from discrimination. The part people like Jordan B Peterson hold issue with is the potential for compelled speech, where one must use ""reasonable"" pronouns when referring to a person.

Recently my girlfriend, her friend and I went for a hike. We discussed the bill. I explained that I don't agree with compelled speech, even if used to protect someone. They disagreed, mostly in a civil manner, until my girlfriend's friend explained that because I was a man, I was less empathetic, which is why I could not relate to how trans people feel. 

My sister is currently transitioning to become my brother. I have actively tried to support my brother when speaking to my parents on the matter. 

I was furious. I am too used to either explicitly or implicitly being told I lack empathy for people. That because of the way I was born I am less capable of relating to a person. Do any of you have this happen?

TLDR: Went for a hike, argued with girlfriend and friend. Was told I don't feel empathy and therefore don't get an opinion.",OneY

When your males friends embarrass or say horrible things to do... publicly.,"Hey,

Maybe I'm missing something, but sometimes I feel like I'm the only one of my friends who is treated like this. My friends (especially my work friends) have no problem saying embarrassing thing about me in public, or in front of other people. I also found out recently that a ""friend"" of mine openly talks about trying to screw me over at work and get one over on me etc.

I feel though that if I bark back, (especially from past experiences) people will get highly insulted and even combative,so I just stopped and now I just take the abuse. I wanted to confront the guy who has been openly talking about screwing me over (other people mentioned it to me, and that it's been going on for a while) but I feel like if I do I'll come off as bitchy or whiny. 

I don't see other guys I know do this to each other, other then in jest; but to me it seems like they're being callous. 

How would you guys handle this? Would you confront someone openly talking about trying to screw you over? How would you do it? Does anybody else notice that if they dish it out, they get treated like they're being insulting?

Very angry at my parents for circumcision,"I’m 21, male, from Alabama. The point of this post is to hopefully encourage anyone who is considering circumcising their children to think carefully before doing so, and to vent.
Until recently, I had never even thought about the fact that I was circumcised. It meant nothing to me. But that changed when I got into an argument and started looking up information in order to understand my side, and since then I can’t help but be extremely angry at my parents. Part of me wishes I never discovered it.
If the information I researched is correct, the part of the penis that’s cut off is filled with nerve endings that help sex to be more pleasurable. So the basic gist of it is this: when I was too young to even think, my religious parents made a decision for me that would impact me for the rest of my life. I am not religious anymore and am somewhat against it, and now I have this thing that was done to me for purely religious reasons without any kind of consent from me, and it pisses me off that this shit is allowed- this is *standard* where I live. I’m not going to say that circumcision is as immoral or painful as female genital mutilation - I’ve heard it causes even more problems such as issues peeing, I don’t know for myself these things. But I will say that circumcision, to me, is just a way of saying “male genital mutilation” without the “mutilation” connotation. There are possibly health benefits to this practice, but from what I’ve seen and read they are incredibly outdated and not needed for the modern world. For instance, circumcised penises are easier to clean. I can see this being beneficial back in the days when they couldn’t shower daily, but nowadays it’s not even an issue (depending on your living conditions, of course.)
So, I’ve never really felt this. The feeling of having had something precious taken from you without any consent. And I understand it now, it sucks, even if I don’t feel it to the same degree as many others do.
And you may say “well, it’s just sexual pleasure! It’s not that important.” 
Think about this. One day, you discover that one of the activities you do regularly and enjoy could be even better and even more pleasurable, but unless you go through this long process to basically de-circumcise yourself, you’ll never be able to experience that, because your parents decided when you were too young to think that they should cut off a part of your body.

The proper way to handle circumcision in the future? I don’t give a shit if your religion says to do it as a child. Wait until the kid is 18 and can consent, and if they still want to do it then... If they’re that dedicated, then you can cut off their fucking foreskin.

What Are Your Feelings On The March For Life?,"I thought I'd put this question out there since it looks like the abortion debate is going to heat up again. That's because the annual March for Life is going on right now. Since I happen to live less than a hour away from Washington DC, I've seen the influx of protesters, signs, and what not. I haven't seen anything too extreme, but that hasn't stopped more than a few arguments.

I usually go out of my way to avoid talking about abortion among women. I find that being a man and talking about abortion is an untenable conversation, one that nobody wins. If you're a man, it's almost impossible to win any debate. But since this is a sub for men, I thought I'd ask about it since it still affects us, albeit more indirectly.

Personally, I've always seen abortion as one of those issues that has a powerful emotional hook, but the controversy mostly comes from the implications. Beyond those who claim abortion is murder or an exercise of bodily autonomy, I often wonder how much *other* reasons play into the issue.

For the religious crowd, it seems a secondary issue is that abortion means less unwanted children and unwanted children tend to keep people in poverty. Those in poverty tend to be less educated and more religious. So in a sense, wanting to prohibit abortion is a mechanism for gaining and/or preserving new adherents.

For the non-religious crowd, the secondary issue seems to involve a mix of sexual freedom and demographic concerns. Abortion seems to be key to punishing or facilitating exercises in sexuality that some deem ""immoral."" It seems like an indirect way of punishing someone who has more sex than they should.

I don't think it's possible to win debates on whether abortion is murder or when life begins. Those are both circular arguments that never go anywhere. But it's the implications that seem to be most revealing. Since nobody can argue against dead babies, I get the sense abortion is one of those blanket issues that allow people to fight for other issues without overtly admitting it.

That's just my opinion, though. I'm sure there are plenty in this sub who disagree with me. Even though men don't have babies, abortion still affects them so it's worth discussing.",OneY
5 women reasons should consider dating a guy in a wheelchair,"TL;DR; : This is a sample summary of the TLDR rule, all things are bold. Is this going the right way?. This article is intended to discuss the possible apprehensions some women may feel about having a romantic relationship with a man in a wheelchair. It also provides 5 reasons why women should consider this kind of relationship. This not an exhaustive list or explanation by any means nor is it intended to paint anyone with a broad brush. It is my personal perspective as a man in a wheelchair.

Hello there, my name is Ian. When I was 10 I got very sick very fast and I was left with physical disability, to this day (im 23 now) i still use a wheelchair to traverse the world around me. Over the years i have overcome many challenges and have developed perseverance. Despite all that i have overcome and continue to fight through one thing still eludes me. I have been unable to find a girlfriend. No matter how nice i am, how funny i am or intelligent i present myself ladies only seem to see the chair and nothing more. I cant get inside their head but if i had to guess they see a guy in a chair as challenge, a source of instability be it (financial, emotional or medical). Some ladies may see a guy in a wheelchair as an impediment to adventure or insufficient sexual satisfaction. Well ladies let me put some of your fears or questions to rest as I lay out the top 5 reasons you should consider having a romantic relationship with a man in a wheelchair.

    Men who use wheelchairs are often very mature and level headed. From personal experience I can tell you that when I got sick at the age of 10 I grew up very fast. My childhood ended in a single day and from that day forward i had to be an adult. I had to come face to face with death and suffering and i quickly learned how truly fragile life is and that nothing should be taken for granted. Not every guy in a chair had a life altering event, some are born that way. Regardless of how they obtained their physical disability there is a high chance that they have come to see how fragile life is and what it means to suffer. Going through these unique and painful experiences causes these men to develop character and mature perspective. So ladies if your having a pity party and need some perspective or feeling sorry for yourself you should look to a guy in a chair because he will have words of wisdom and advice that will cheer you up and snap you out of your self indulgent stupor. Remember this, you become like who you hang out with, so if your going to spend your life with a guy wouldnt you want him to be as mature, empathetic and levelheaded as possible? I am not going to lie, some guys in wheelchairs are bitter about their experiences but they are not the majority. Don't let the few that are bitter ruin for the bunch.

    Guys in wheelchairs can have good paying jobs too. In this day and age one does not need to be able bodied in order to find a high paying jobs. Many guys in wheelchairs find jobs in Engineering, law, and even medicine. I actually had a neurologist who was a guy in a wheelchair. I myself am earning a degree in mechanical engineering. In this day and age everything comes down to computers, if you can use a computer to prepare and edit documents, use spreadsheet programs, write code, design in C.A.D then you can find a good paying job. Although most guys in wheelchairs can drive to work due to adaptive technology many of the jobs today that are computer driven can be done from home. So even if the guy in wheelchair cant drive he can still find a good job. So ladies you need to assume that just because a guy uses a chair that he wont be able to pull his own weight financially, he can still be a worthy provider.

    intimacy with a guy in chair does not have to be boring. Ladies a guy in wheelchair is just as capable at pleasing you as an able bodied man. This does not mean that he will be able to do every position you want to do or will be able to be as spontaneous you like. In some cases he may not even feel whats happening. However he is a unique position in that woman is the dominant one and he is by default the submissive one. Ladies in this kind of relationship you have all the power, you get to decide what goes where and how much ect. This does not mean you should take advantage of him, but he is at your mercy and he has to trust you that your not going to take advantage of him. This makes sex more than just about skin on skin, sex becomes true exploration of not only physical boundaries but trust boundaries. This deep trust will create a firmer relationship and a more robust love life. He is not just going to wheel off and have sex with some woman hes never met before because shes hot, he is only going to want to have sex with you because he can trust you, but he cant trust her. He knows who has the power and it is not him so he cant just do it with anyone. Also dont overlook the opportunity to be extra kinky, because he is in a wheelchair there are all sorts of things you can try that would be weird in a normal relationship but not in this one, like medical role playing, chair bondage and E-stim (many people in wheelchairs have E-stim units to keep their musceles from atrophying but these units could be used for sexual purposes as well). So keep all this in mind next time you see a cute guy in a chair wheeling your way.

    Guys in wheelchairs can make good fathers. Just because dad is in a wheelchair does not mean he cant be a good role model for the kids or cant assist in parenting. Sure he may not be able to play contact sports with little Jimmy or dance with little little Sara but he can do plenty of other things. He can teach the kids valuable life lessons like not taking things for granted, helping others in need and how to push through hardships. A man in a chair can still discipline the kids and garner their respect, he can still be there for them when they cry. Being a great dad is not about having strong legs, its about providing and strong ground to stand on.

    Dont let the health or medical aspects of a man in a wheelchair scare you. Not all guys that use chair need to use catheters or need assistance bathing. But if they do dont let this frighten you. If a guy in a wheelchair need assistance with certain things see those as opportunities to build trust and learn knew skills. These are areas where he can be vulnerable and open about how he feels and how much he appreciates having your kindness in his life. You dont have to be a nurse or doctor to be able to do these things, you can learn many of them from youtube lectures or he can teach you. More than looks most guys rather they admit it or not find compassion sexy. Dont be afraid to be his angle, he will never forget your kindness.

I know I could not cover everything about having a relationship with a wheelchair using man but I hope this clears up possible fears or apprehension about having a romantic relationship with a guy in a chair. Remember everyone needs to be loved even guys in wheelchairs.

why does no one take mens penis insecurities seriously?,"now I understand apparently on this sub everyone has an at least average penis apparently but even here, no one seems to take it seriously when someone feels incredibly inadequate about their size. there is no place on earth a young dude can actually talk about this in a reasonable environment, for female insecurities there is an entire army to make them feel better and shame anyone who dares to criticize them or reject them for it, going too far often times. but there is nothing like this for men. and we know that penis size obviously matter. I'm not talking about average guys being sad about not being big(the biggest crowd), which are the people that always jump into the discussion in posts like this telling everyone how size does not matter. it's the actually smaller guys, guys that have penises around 4 inches. let me tell you, that shit sucks. and no one wants to hear about it, no one takes it seriously because of all those memes about how size does not matter and how it's technique that is important. but these memes don't talk about small guys, they talk about average size guys that shit their pants because they are not big enough. 

but size itself of course matters once you are too small. and there are various patterns that become impossible to ignore once you follow the discussion.

women will either say size does not matter (as long as it is a certain size!) and bigger is not always better. notice how this says nothing about small guys, guys that are ACTUALLY small, all they ever say is how monster cocks are not that enjoyable and how average is fine. well, that's great for the average guy(about 30% are clearly below average, are they not existent?? they probably dont even consider them anyway). but there is a shit load of men below average and there is also many of them who are actually much much smaller.


and all this crappy talk about how you have to use your hands which is basically admitting that size does matter and you have to make up for it. you don't realize how much it actually matters once you are small and I mean not 5 inches small but 4 and below.

the fact is, it does absolutely matter, I know that' something everyone has to deal with themselves but denying this is much more toxic than just admitting that it does. admittedly I still feel like absolute shit about it, sex has been terrible so far(pst it's not how you use it once you are so small that no one can actually feel it). whatever, I could go on like this for hours, it's just very depressing and no one seems to give you the time of the day to even listen or acknowledge that these issues are very real. whatever, fuck this shit",OneY
Men's Reproductive Rights and Fathers' Rights,"A woman can go without contraception and choose to abort, thereby refusing parenthood.

A man can go with his condom and spermicide, get a woman pregnant, and is chained to her decision legally and as a parent.

Men's right to choose should be debated and fought for, as it would not only provide men the opportunity that women have to plan when they become parents, (thereby alleviating future issues of poverty and orphanage) but would also give greater support to fathers' rights as parents.

This is assuming a ""paper abortion method is followed. In the event a woman is pregnant, a man must sign-on to become a parent OR must sign away his rights as a parent before the legal window for the mother to perform abortion is closed. This would likely include the man being responsible for paying her medical expenses for either birth or abortion in the event he decides to opt-out.

Furthermore, a father who signs on or decides not to opt out would be viewed different legally, being a dedicated parent in this new world of men's choice. Fathers' rights would be confirmed and undeniable. Equal parenthood would have much better feet to stand on.

"I have an (almost) irrational fear of infidelity, and I need your help to find peace.","Note: TL;DR at the end.

Hello everyone. I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while, unsure if I should post this here. But I see everyone here is so nice and supportive. So I mustered the courage to finally ask for help.

I'm a 24 years old, bisexual man. I've never been in a relationship and at the moment I'm sincerely not interested. I have a very open sexual life with multiple sexual partners (all men). That's just the life I want right now. Note that I'm confident in myself and I think I can be loved. I think that if I put myself out there I'll eventually find someone who'll love me and I'll love them.

Having said that, I also have a number of relationship-related fears that haunt me from time to time. I don't think about them actively. But when something brings them up, like a story or a movie, I'm haunted by them for days, maybe weeks. I fall into a state of anxiety and depression, constantly thinking about the idea, and the things that COULD happen IF I was in a relationship.

Among the several fears, the one that haunts me the most, is my fear of being cheated on. I fear the heartbreak that comes with it, the loss of trust, and above all the shame that might fall upon me if the incident becomes known. This is especially amplified when I imagine being cheated on with multiple people. I know it's natural to be a afraid of such things, but maybe not to the degree I experience.

Lately I've been contemplating whether my lack of interest in relationships is driven by my desires or my fears. Is the life I'm enjoying just a way to escape those fears? Am I really not interested in relationships or am I just afraid? Are my sexual habits just a way to tell myself that I'm in total control of my sexual life?

I kindly ask for your help to bring peace to my mind. What can I do? What's wrong with the way I'm thinking? I'm not looking to gain interest in pursuing relationships. I just want my decisions in romance and sex to be driven purely by my desires, not my fears.

Thank you kindly in advance for your help and support.

TL;DR: Even though I'm not interested in relationships, I greatly fear being cheated on. This makes me doubt my decision to remain single and my enjoyment of an open sexual life. I want to bring peace to my mind so that I can make decisions based on desires, not fears.",OneY

concerning ejac in regards to self checks,"disclaimer:after googling and a cursory search here, i resolved it's best to just ask, as time is a factor. apologies in advance if this has been addressed, &amp;/or if this is the wrong place to discuss this particular subject,  please redirect politely. just trying to get sorted.


I'm a 28 year old american male, is sexually active in a monogamous relationship (high sex drive, moderately sexually active in said relationship. i guess its worth noting despite the  discrepency im not into masturbating much &amp; just deal with it. so it goes. just thought it may be relevant to any potential diagnosis. if not feel free to disregard.)


tl;dr: I'm wondering whether or not it's better to have ejaculated recently prior to performing the self check? &amp; if so, how long ought one to wait before checking post climax? 



all things considered, i imagine a dry spell could and would  affect the results. inb4 the resounding position on the issue (so difficult to refrain from word play, fml) is to see a physician asap if there's even the slightest inclination of anything disconcerting. regardless, it seems prudent (irony noted) to make sure either way that said dry spell is not the issue (i mean, it never has been before but i read that frequent orgasms, 21 per month is suggested to avoid prostate cancer, which was news to me, &amp; made me want to seek consul, thusly).

Until highschool I was very secure in my masculinity and who I was as a male, but that all changed freshman year

Around freshman year I noticed that I started to feel comfortable in girls clothes and such (Don't worry this isn't a trans help issue). This at first was a little alarming to me as I thought something was wrong with me. But all of this is only a little relevant to what I'm talking about.

She doesn't want to get a job, she sits at home all day and snacks, she doesn't want to go out and do anything other than Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo.  I'm getting bored.  And she also talks to me in an abusive manner.  I'm starting to think that the only reason why she talks to me is because none of her friends have a car, but I do.

My previous girlfriend before her, talked down to me like I was some kind of animal.  I got sick of it to the point where I pretty much walked away from her at our State's Fair and NEVER LOOKED BACK!!!  Everybody talked to her about how she treated me. 

My girlfriend before that was nice to me, until I started moving up in the world.  When I first met her, I had no car, no job prospects, nothing.  Just a dream to get out of my abusive mom's house.   I noticed just as soon as I got my driver's license, she would get constantly abusive towards me.   

My background is pretty simple.  I came from a religious tradition where you were taught to be submissive.  I left and I sort of rebelled.  I returned back to my roots and I'm still a bit polite and non-confrontational.   

But when I was out, I learned how to stand up for myself.  I have a black belt in TKD.  I went from being passive to having an ""iron fist in a velvet glove"" type personality.

She smashed one of my laptops because I told a female friend of mine that she looked good.    I told her right there and then that I didn't want to see her again.    Like I put on my clothes, hopped into my car and was about to delete her from my phone contacts list.  She then promised to change, and she went out of her way to stop being so jealous, and I let her stick around, with the reminder that if she tried that crap again with me, I'll leave her life.   

The aforementioned ex, I told her ""Treat me better, or else I will leave you"".   She didn't treat me better, and sure enough, I left her.  She was shocked when I left her.   She still won't talk to me to this day.

I [26M] was catcalled last night by a woman. Feeling weird and creeped out.,"I was jogging home from the gym last night around 8pm and was just turning the corner onto my street when a middle aged woman driving an unmarked white van leaned out the window, wolf whistled, and proceeded to make lewd comments about how great my butt looked.

I probably get catcalled (is that still what it’s called when women do it to men?) at most a few times a year and generally don’t feel threatened by it as an able-bodied male so at first I laughed it off but then got to thinking... I live in a college town where students have been kidnapped before and didn’t have my phone with me. What if she had followed me or had friends in the van? Ever since last night I have just been feeling really creeped out and uncomfortable.

I don’t know what kind of advice I’m asking for specifically but any insight into how you deal with feelings when uncomfortable situations like these arise would be appreciated.
As a man, what is the correct response to this? I don’t know if I should have confronted her or just kept running as I did, or if I should be concerned about going out alone at night knowing that she and her kidnapper van might be in the neighborhood. I don’t want to feel like I have to carry a weapon or fear going outside at night in my own community.

Edit: for those of you who feel the need to come in here just to post “grow a pair” and such, you have no idea what the experience was like and what kind of neighborhood I live in. There are high rates of student kidnappings in my area, yes even young able-bodied men. If you really feel the need to come in here and belittle me for feeling concerned for my safety and sharing my experience, that reflects only on your poor character.",OneY

Hypothetical question: What would happen in society if male sex drive was optional?,"First of all: I looked in the sidebar and did not find any mention concerning hypotheticals, pro or con. I know that some people are viscerally against them, for some reason that I cannot fathom. If hypotheticals are not wanted here, please inform me.

That out of the way: IMO, it appears that a lot of the driver for various societal ills is the fact that there is a lot of unfulfilled male sex drive. An individual man can overcome that problem by making himself more attractive, but that is not a solution on a societal level - male sex drive and female sex supply are a zero-sum game. 

So let us imagine a society in which there is no excess male sex drive. Imagine that there would be a pill that has no effect whatsoever on women, and has only one intended effect on men: if a man eats one pill in the morning, then his sex drive completely disappears for 24 hours. However, this pill does not affect sexual capacity, so if some woman would hit on him, then he could still perform.

A man who knows that he is not likely to score could eat this pill in order to stop being distracted by his lack of scoring, and depressed by it. Students could eat the pill before important tests in order to be able to focus better on their test preparations. Men married to low libido wives could adjust their libido, without being held hostage by their wives.

One could also imagine a society-wide reaction, in which all men eat the pill daily so that the total amount of male sex drive, and thus sexual demand, falls to zero. We would then have a supply-side glut in the market.

So, fellow redditors: What do you think would happen if this hypothetical pill would become reality, and it is both without side effects and reasonably cheap?",OneY

Thoughts on the mens movement and related to this subbredit.,"Hello everyone. :) Since I see this subreddit is actually interested in male rights and issues (unlike other subreddits that only pretend to do so) I would like to share some thoughts with you, and ask of your opinion.
I've been an MRA since 2014. i have been following people like Karen Straughan, The Honey badgers, AVFM around and I am noticing patterns that I want to share with you. First off, Karen Straughan was really vital in getting the message out there, since she had the big following. Her other strenght was debunking the whole theory that most feminists push for- that it is women who are the disadvantaged sex and that there is nothing! gynocentric going on in the legal system or society. And she was brilliant at doing that. The  Honey badgers and AVFM largely did the same thing, except the Honeybadgers didnt have her big following. (im not sure what the following of AVFM was). Now, things get iffy for me, is when she and other MRAs started talking about biology, very heavily implying that gender roles are inevitable and that men will never be regarded as victims of domestic violence and rape because ""gynocentrism is so genetically encoded in us"". Now, couple that mindset with what happened politically- the rise of the Alt-right movement since 2015, and we have a mens movement that currently, repeats a lot of right- wing ( far- right) talking points. Like blaming leftism for everything bad in the world, or even buying the right-wing conspiracy theory of Cultural Marxism. You can see this with the infatuation of many MRAs with Jordan Peterson- who is heavily advocating for gender roles. 
Why do you think the movement devolved into this? Why not be a regular conservative, if all you do is being anti-feminist and advocating for women to say ""thank you""? This mindset has hijacked the Mens rights movement. I just don't get how the movement devolved so much, to the point where Karen Straughan interviewed the white supremacist Christopher Cantwell and was nodding in agreement with him during their talk. Since I cant have an HONEST discussion when i talk about this on r/mensrights, im posting this here. I know other posters who get immediately barraged when they even slightly imply they are not right wingers/right libertarians. 
Because the problem is, the regressive left is not really interested in men's issues, and the conservative right wants men to be disposable. So men are stuck. 
I think this is an important issue.",OneY
Imagine The Perfect Reversible Long-Term Contraceptive For Men...What Would It Be?,"I've seen this come up in a few other subs involving men's issues. I'd thought I'd start a discussion here. Male contraception isn't really a hot topic, but it is one of those advanced that we're often told is getting closer. Like nuclear fusion, it always seems just on the horizon. But I think with recent trends in biotechnology, we are on the cusp of a new era for male birth control.

The most promising, to date, is something called Vasalgel. If you're not familiar with it, look it up. It's very promising in that it's a one-time injection that lasts years on end, has no hormones, and is as effective as a vasectomy. It's still in the testing stages, but the results are promising.

It does have shortcomings, though. Applying Vasalgel is invasive and since it involves a targeted injection, there's a lot of room for error. Then again, the same can be said for the current contraceptives available to men, which are quite limited. Other than sterilization and condoms, men don't have many options and they aren't as fool-proof as some of the options women have, such as IUDs.

So I'd like to pose a thought experiment to all the men in this sub. Imagine the perfect, long-term contraceptive for men. What form would it take?

Would it be a pill?

Would it be an injection?

Would it be some sort of patch or implant?

How would it theoretically work?

Contraception changed a lot for women throughout society. A similar advancement for men would undoubtedly change a lot as well. Given that advances like Vasalgel are so close, most of us will experience those changes within our lifetimes. So I think it's worth contemplating what the future of male contraception may be and what form it may take.",OneY

anyone here developed strategies on how to cope with having a small penis [searching for someone to talk about this],"I had sex for the first time a while ago, my girl said she liked it but I think she is just being nice. I don't think she will break up because of it because she really is into me but there is no way she enjoyed penetration. my dick is 4.1*4.2 and even I didn't feel a lot. don't get me wrong, we had sex many times and tried out several positions. doggy didn't even work. when she is on top I slip out. I tried to fuck her with her belly on the bed from the back, it didn't really work either. also it feels like putting my dick into a warm towel, there is so little friction and I don't think she can actually feel me inside her.

that thought is terrible. it really gets to me. if I can't even feel friction.. I can get her off by eating her out fairly easily but when I put it in, I don't know there is no special reaction on her side. no gasp, no moaning
I'm searching for someone to talk about this. like, I really think that could help me a lot. 

please don't tell me to break up with her, I love her to death and she is crazy about me, I just can't get along with this thing, it's a serious burden in my life right now

Should I [20M] ask this girl [19] I went on a date with what she meant by a comment she made?,"So on Wednesday I went on a date with a girl I had been talking to for a month. I really like her, as I am a very lonely person I can get attached very quickly and we had a lot in common. Anyway, when we were on a date, aside from it seeming like she wasn't that interested, she asked me a hypothetical question, if I met a date and they looked different from how they did in their pics (i.e. facial features looked different) and they were ugly, what would you do? She said if it was her she would just spend the day with them because she's 'not rude' then never talk to them again.

I have a feeling she was trying to hint something to me by what she said. After she asked me if I was overthinking what she said, and I said no, even though I was. And it has been on my mind since, and has ruined my self esteem. I have just stayed in my bed since and been down, I haven't even looked at myself in the mirror.

Should I ask her if that's what she thought of me when she said that? I feel like I have to know, but if she says yes it will hurt a lot more.

Films/TV Can Show Penises But Not Vaginas,"Tried posting this in r/feminism and two Xx’s and basically got no response. Now I’m interested in the male perspective:

**TLDR**

Discussions with my girlfriend about imbalance of male/female nudity in film lead us to discover that while women have been shown more frequently partially nude, female genitalia is almost entirely banned from TV/film while male genitalia is freely shown.

**Opening**

A few points of disclosure before you vote/comment please. First, I am a man. I understand this limits my ability to view things from the female perspective. That’s a big part of the reason I’m coming to a feminist subreddit to get opinions on this topic. Second, I’ve discussed this topic with my girlfriend and done some research on my own. What I’m mostly looking for here is broader feedback on her perspective and what I’ve read online.

**Background**

Since this is a strange topic I want to make it known that I’m not some kind of pervert who just wants to see vaginas in film/TV. If that were my motivation I’d just go watch porn. My interest in this topic is sociological: what does this say about gender relations in the US?

I had never really thought about this topic before a few months ago when Wonder Woman came out. My girlfriend and I both saw the film and really enjoyed it. In particular we discussed how wonderful it was to have a strong female lead in an action movie with a female director. It broke some molds for a blockbuster and was a win for equality of the sexes.

I told her that I would like be able to take my daughter to see it (age 9, from a previous relationship), because of these strong feminist themes, but that I was concerned she was too young for some of the sexual content. In particular, the Chris Pine nude scene but also the discussions about whether men are necessary for pleasure.

She took this is as a criticism of the inclusion of the Chris Pine nude scene (not my intent) and ended up sending me an article talking about how the inclusion of that scene was a win for feminism since action movies typically have “the male gaze” and include unnecessary sex appeal targeted to men. Having Wonder Women fully clothed while a man is helplessly naked in front of her was supposed to be “a reversal.” I responded that since true feminism is about equality and includes advocacy for men’s issues, we shouldn’t consider “pay back” to be a good motive.

This lead to a broader **friendly** discussion about the imbalance of male/female nudity. Neither of us are jealous, we’re just both interested in sociology. It went something like this:

**Her:** Women are shown “nude” more frequently.

**Me:** Breasts are shown more frequently than full male nudity, but men are shown shirtless as often or more often and this is often for sexual appeal.

**Her:** But men being shirtless isn’t considered nudity. Only a penis counts as nudity.

**Me:** Movies do show penises on occasion, but never vaginas (I’ll clarify what I mean by this later.) More importantly, I thought desexualizing breasts was a goal of feminism? (Aka free the nipple)

When Thor: Ragnarok came out I rekindled the discussion by sending her [this article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/director-taika-waititi-added-gratuitous-shirtless-chris-hemsworth-scene-thor-ragnarok-put-bums-seats-184953728.html) (or one like it) where Chris Hemsworth says he thought his shirtless scene was “unnecessary” and “gratuitous” and that it wasn’t originally in the script. He was forced to do the scene by his director for sex appeal. She agreed with me that if a female actor was forced to do unscripted nudity for “sex appeal” to men, that it would be considered sexual harassment and probably lead to a media blow up.

The only point of disagreement we still have really is on the disparate treatment of genitalia in film/TV.

**Research**

The MPAA has strict rules regarding showing genitalia in film. Breaking these rules takes you from “R” to “NC17” and shrinks your potential audience. Penises can be shown, but not fully erect. If they flop, they can only flop side to side and not up or down (looks too much like an erection.) Vaginas on the other hand, usually can’t be shown at all (meaning no labia minor, labia major, or even vulva “cleft.”) If a woman does “full frontal nudity” she usually has to have either a naturally thick bush or wear a “merkin” which covers her actual parts.

&gt; The MPAA will allow a penis up close, for an extended period, in good lighting, and now semi-erect, (Hall Pass / Bruno) whereas the vulva, labia, clitoris, or vagina have been shown a grand total of ZERO times (unless you want to count the ""did I see what I thought I just saw"" moment of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Rosario Dawson in Trance). If a female's pubic region is clean shaven she will be required to wear a merkin (pu**y wig) so as not to show any vulva cleft and get the dreaded NC-17.

[Source](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-movies-allowed-to-show-a-penis-but-not-a-vagina)

There are a few very minor exceptions to this. “Trance” drew some criticism for showing a fully nude Rosario Dawson with a shaved pubic region. This had a very specific purpose in the story, so maybe that’s why it escaped the NC17 rating (there were still no labia shown, but it was a bald pubic area showing the cleft, which is extremely rare.)

However, despite the calls for “more penis” in shows like Game of Thrones or movies and TV in general—and despite praise for shows like American Gods for [showing a lot of dong](https://www.google.com/amp/s/themuse.jezebel.com/so-far-american-gods-has-shown-more-dick-than-all-of-t-1793867555/amp)—male genitalia are not black listed in the same way.

The more I read about this the more I thought my original conception of the problem may have been backwards. I was thinking the imbalance was sexist against men, but it’s really sexist against women. Vaginas are seen as more “pornographic” than penises because of outdated concepts about female purity. Male actors who go nude are called “bold” and “brave” while female actors risk slut shaming.

&gt; I asked someone who knows a lot about vaginas, Emma Rees, author of The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, why films felt more comfortable depicting one genitalia over the other. Turns out, vaginas are pretty radical. ""When a woman is doing her own thing with her own body, the action has an impact far beyond the immediate act: It becomes symbolic of an independence and self-governance that is threatening precisely because it excludes the penis,"" she said. ""The response to this, literally for millennia, has been ridicule, rage, or violence.""

&gt; Namely, it was the autonomy of the vagina from being arousing to men that reconfigured it as something radical or taboo. ""One of the most interesting things I learned while writing was just how illogically squeamish people are about vaginas, vulvas, labia, and so on,"" Rees continued. ""This was especially apparent in the complaints people made at an artist's exhibition which showed beautiful images of crowning [the moment the baby's head first appears during vaginal childbirth]. The revulsion some people articulated was hypocritical in many cases—the same people saying, 'Urgh! A vagina!' were probably only two mouse-clicks away from accessing porn and saying, 'Ooh! A vagina!' Some people get very anxious when the vagina is not being represented for their pleasure; they feel excluded by its power and autonomy.""

**Questions**

Do you think we need more vaginas in film/TV as an expression of female power?

Do you think there should be more penises in TV/film?

Do you think “paying back” generations of gratuitous female nudity with unnecessary male nudity or partial nudity is a good strategy for feminists who believe in equality?

**TLDR**

Discussions with my girlfriend about imbalance of male/female nudity in film lead us to discover that while women have been shown more frequently partially nude, female genitalia is almost entirely banned from TV/film while male genitalia is freely shown.

My Great-Grandfather's Last (Happy) Last Day Of Life,"Every holiday, my relatives come to town and they just love sharing all these quirky stories about those no longer with us. This year is no exception and one, in particular, stood out. It's one I think the men in this sub might appreciate.

My grandmother on my mom's side, who has no filter, mind you, decided to tell the whole family about the day my great-grandfather died. It was actually a much happier story than I expected. On the day he died, this is what my great-grandfather did.

He woke up.

He had sex with his wife (my great-grandmother)

He ate breakfast and read the paper.

He went bowling, which he loves.

He came home and sat down in his favorite recliner.

Then, he quietly passed away.

It wasn't traumatic or anything. He didn't stay in the hospital for months on end. He just passed. My grandmother wasn't sure if it was a heart attack or a stroke. She just knew that he died in his recliner as if he'd fallen asleep.

While losing a loved one is hard, when a man goes out like that, you can't help but find something inherently uplifting. My great-grandfather lived a full life, seeing his kids and his grandkids grow up. Then, on his final day, he does what he loves with the people he loves and just checks out.

As a man, I think that's a good way to go. Just wanted to share that here.",OneY
Spent the night with a friend's ex from years ago and found out he still has feelings for her.,"So my friend dated this girl and they broke up roughly around 3 years ago. Since then he has had a 2 year relationship as well as a multiple other short ones as well has slept with quite a few people. Anyways we've been hanging out a lot and the other night she sleeps over and considering everything I just said we end up cuddling and kissing, no sex though. From what I knew they barely talked. Well so that night happens and the next day I talk to him and tell him how much I like this girl and if he would be okay with anything going forward and he tells me that he's been sleeping with her on and off (while still sleeping with other people mind you) and that he still has feelings for her and that he wouldn't want things to go forward with me and her. Like, shit I had no idea.  I feel like shit now. I thought 3 years and everything that happened was more than enough time. Like it's been so long it didn't even cross my mind. I tell him that I respect that and I won't go forward with anything but he doesn't know about the night we spent together. I tell her that we can't go forward with anything and that we can't do that again. Next day he asks her to take him back and she says no because she no longer has feelings for him. Unbeknownst to me he has also asked a month ago and she said no then also. I had no idea anything was going on but now I feel like crap. 

He seems like he's having a bad time and I feel like telling him right now would certainly ruin our friendship. What should I do? Should I wait?",OneY

TIL that men are raped almost as frequently as women,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/

""We assessed 12-month prevalence and incidence data on sexual victimization in 5 federal surveys that the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted independently in 2010 through 2012. We used these data to examine the prevailing assumption that men rarely experience sexual victimization. We concluded that federal surveys detect a high prevalence of sexual victimization among men—in many circumstances similar to the prevalence found among women. We identified factors that perpetuate misperceptions about men’s sexual victimization: reliance on traditional gender stereotypes, outdated and inconsistent definitions, and methodological sampling biases that exclude inmates. We recommend changes that move beyond regressive gender assumptions, which can harm both women and men.""

I'm (25m) a late bloomer. And I have some growing insecurities and worries about it. I was hoping to put them to rest.,"I initially tried posting this to relationships. But it was removed for being too general. So I'm asking here. If this doesn't belong here feel free to delete it. 

I was raised in a small isolated town where I was bullied and ostracised by most of my peers. 

Because of this i spent most of my youth behind a computer screen gaming. I never had a great social life or a real chance to try new hobbies or explore my interests. 

So I'm still somewhat struggling to find my identity. I do have some hobbies and interests. But they're pretty niche and solitary. Plus mental health and financial issues put a real damper on any progress for the last few years. But things are looking up. 

I did however manage to learn how to socialize. I have a decent if not closed off group of friends. And talking to strangers/making new friends is so easy that I once talked my way into eating dinner with a family of complete strangers as a door to door salesperson. 

I have no issues talking to women. Though I may be a bit lacking in the flirting department. And I don't think I would have an issue with asking a girl out in person if I liked her. I'm just not in a situation where I'm physically around any that would be remotely compatible with me. 

I have gotten dates online. Three women. But they were all kinda bad... from treating me like a trophy she could show to her larp group. To not speaking more than a few words over two dates. To comparing me to her ex an hour after meeting me. 

This has all built a few fears in me. So I'm here hoping to settle them down a bit. Or get some perspective from others who may have been in a similar situation. 

They are as follows. 

I'm afraid that I'll never get to experience ""young love"" I know it's awkward and sometimes objectively bad. But I still crave that ""innocence"" and sense of uncertainty. 

As much as I would personally be ok with hopping into sex in the first few dates. I kinda don't want that. I want to know that there's an attraction to the personality as well. And from what I've seen of others relationships. They all seem pretty shallow to me.

Im afraid That by the time I get into a relationship. My future partner/people in my age group will be ready to settle down and I'll have never actually gotten that chance to ""live"" and experience things that can show me what I want and don't want in a partner. 

I'm afraid that this loneliness will persist. That I'll never find somebody who I find genuinely attractive and interesting. Who simultaneously sees me the same way.

The three women ive dated really reinforce this. I was only immediately attracted to one. But I gave them all a chance because I firmly believe that a good personality can make up for that. I've gotten huge crushes on girls who I didn't find initially find attractive because they were so cool. 

And with all three I just felt kind of... bored. I mean I can carry on a conversation easily with just about anybody. So maybe it was that. 

Or maybe it was because the interests and hobbies I do have are solitary and kinda niche.

I'm afraid that time is just slipping away. One piece of advice that's stuck with me is ""be the kind of person your dream partner is waiting to meet""

And I don't feel like I really match up to that ideal just yet. My identity issues being the main part of that. 

I know I can. But it's going to take time. And as they say. Time stops for no man. So I'm afraid that as time goes on. My options and chances are dwindling. 

I'm afraid that I'll only ever be somebody's second choice. 

Or more or less. I'm afraid that I'll never actually be able to ""catch up."" That somehow my lack experiences early on will keep me behind. And that I'll just be the guy who gets settled for because I'm a decent second choice.",OneY

I was kissed and groped by the babysitters daughter when I was 5. I got into porn way too young, like 12 ish. I began masturbating a bit after that. I had my best friend take my then girlfriend's (different girl) virginity soon after we broke up. I've always used sex as a validating tool rather than an actual human experience. 

When I was 16 I was pushy and coercing Sam into having sex with me when I wanted. We've discussed it and realized that what I was doing was sexual assault. It didn't feel like it at the time and neither of could have named it back then but its what it was. I sexually assaulted Sam. I slipped it in after she persistently said no and then just turned her head and cried. I stopped when I realized that she was crying and it was burned into my memory. 

It's been about 8 years since then and yesterday I finally owned up to it and apologized. Nothing I could say or do could ever take it back but her response was better than I deserved. Here is her response:

""I appreciate your apology. To be perfectly honest I had a really hard time coming to terms with the fact that that kind of interaction is sexual assault because it took the number of times I had consensual sex and halved it. That wasn’t the only time I felt like that happened with you but you also aren’t the only person I’ve been in that kind of situation with. I’m glad that you are trying to take ownership of that and make amends. But your right nothing can take it back or fix it.""

She also said : ""I appreciate that. Make sure your sons, nephews, cousins, whatever don’t do it either.As shitty as it is, the strongest impact on a young boy is when a man tells him and sets an example of respecting women and their bodies""

So here I am, embarrassed and ashamed but trying my best to forgive myself and spread a little good into the universe. I've learned and I will never do it again. Any advice from other men who have done the same and have found a way to forgive themselves is much appreciated. Thank you.",OneY

Foreskin not fully retracting when erect,"I'm uncircumcised and I noticed that when my penis is erect my foreskin doesn't fully retract itself over the glans, and I have to do it myself ""manually"". Everybody says that it's supposed to be able to retract itself, but it's not the case with me. I have no trouble pulling it back with my hand. It's not too tight, it's just kind of long.

How common is this? If you're uncircumcised, have you ever had something like this or does your foreskin just retract by itself?",OneY

Tim Ferriss had a sex worker on and the interview touched me emotionally.,"!!!DISCLAIMER!!
Depending what kind of company you work in, this interview might be deemed as NSFW. So use your common sense here people! !!DISCLAIMER!!

[Episode](https://tim.blog/2017/11/17/alice-little)

I found the conversation enlightening. Her opinions on sex work and sexuality were very fascinating. Her name is Alice Little(working name, she's super small). She works at Nevada Moonlite Bunny Ranch, in Nevada. 


at one point, about 50 minutes 30 seconds in, she started to talk about how she would make a male virgin client feel comfortable. 


I'm not a virgin, but the way she described male sexuality moved me in such a profound way. I don't know if I ever heard a woman, or man for that matter, treat my sexuality and feelings in such a respectful and compassionate manner. What she described had me thinking about a lot of stuff. Like what 
standards I should set for my sex-partners. I dunno if this will lead to something actionable or not, we'll see. 


I feel happy, having listened to the interview. Really made my day.

"NSFW: Pessimism, Anger, Porn and Disregard","*NSFW*

tl;dr: How do I get out of the endless cycle of pessimism, anger, porn and disregard?


Hi :)
I am new here, so I hope this is the right place to post and ask about advice. 
What follows is a fairly personal issue I am having trouble with for a long time, which makes me to a person I do not want to be. So I want to change but not know exactly how. If you have useful advice I would be very happy about it. I am thinking about this topic almost everyday since two years and I know tons of other young men have the same issue.

WARNING: It involves porn, sex, personal opinions and pessimism. 
I ask it here, because it doesn’t fit in r/NoFap directly as my intention is not stop jacking off (sounds weird I know, sorry).

Here we go:
I watch porn at least daily to jack off since I am about 13 years old. It has been a normal routine for me for ten years now. The issue with porn is, that I stay in an endless cycle of pessimism, anger, disregard and porn. And I am sick of it.
Most real girls I meet are not attractive to me and I think this is because I am „blunted“ from all the porn I watch. The girls I am (physically) attracted to are not interested in me and apparently from my experience out of my league. This results in me not meeting any girls I like, because
a) of my attitude towards the girls I am not that interested
and 
b) because of my low self-esteem talking to someone, who seems to be not interested in me.

„So shut up, just stop jerking off to porn, get a better attitude and stop whining!“
Well it is not that easy. Otherwise I would have changed it a long time and I would not write this long-ass text. I even made a reddit account for that.

Here is the thing: With the „Not-meeting-someone I like“ for (at least) months comes a lot of pessimism. This pessimism („You just suck and you are not good enough“) develops into an incredible amount of anger („Well you know what? I dont care about these girls. Fuck that. I can watch porn and not have all that stress“). 
The anger just tells me to ignore every girl I can by not looking at them at all and not talking to them (disregard). This makes me feel bad because I generalize and because I feel antisocial.
But because of my damn sexdrive (which I‘d love to turn off) I have to releave somehow. So I start watching porn. It is easy, fast and you dont have to meet, talk or approach somebody. This is an endless vicious cycle I dont know how to get out of.

Of course I tried to stop watching porn on several occasions and I also didn’t watch any for a few months, but it didn’t change my attitude or anything, rather the opposite: With requiring on my own real experiences with sex I think about mostly bad experiences I have made, which turn me off very quickly. 
The only real relationship I had was physically not very satisfying and the one-night-stands usually either. Also with my small amount of memories I have not a lot to think about. I did not meet more girls either, the only thing that changed for me was the size in my pants (sorry again).


So what do you guys think I could do? 
Where should I start, because I am sick of it and sick of me.
I know there are a lot of men in the exact same situation with a lot of frustration.


(To add: English isn't my first language. Yes, I go outside. Yes, I do sports and yes I talk about problems with my friends/family but the porn-topic is something I rather would like to talk about „anonymously“. And Of course Porn is not wrong, but it doesn’t help the way I would like to at all. It makes it easy to change nothing.)


Thank you for the answers

On my glans I have single white spot. It's not on the  edge like Fordyce spots but just  to the right and half way along. Went my local GUM doc regarding the issue, a very young and attractive female doctor (typical!) tested me negatively for everything and said it didn't look like a wart (I wasn't sexually active at the time) but just to be sure gave me this lotion which I religiously applied as prescribed. I asked her what could be done if it wasn't and she just kind of shrugged and that was that. Anyway this lotion didn't work and I still have it. This was ages ago and it's now becoming a psychological issue for me.

How to deal with feeling expendable?,"I've had clinical depression from 15 onwards, dealt with personal bouts of bitterness, suicidal thoughts, and misogyny; embraced feminism and then misogyny again, nihilism and all of that. 

Mulling over all of these things made me realize how little I mattered, as a male. I used to get so upset, wondering why it was  okay for a man to get mutilated on screen and earn cheers but the same thing happening to a woman would draw shock and disbelief. I used to get so upset reading history books and seeing how many poor men who never even had the chance to truly live died at the behest of richer men who feuded over a single woman. I acknowledged that we did it to ourselves. It's our nature as men we're violent, impulsive, testosterone-fueled beings of measured rage. But it still upset me. 

I know that rich men are the stirrers of conflict. Men are the ones who boil the pot. Maybe it's compensation for realizing how little we matter, so we use what advantages we do have (might which makes right) and grasp control. Women will get raped and maybe murdered, which is just as bad, but men will always get murdered. My life has no value. The male has no value in the natural world. Not to females, and certainly not to other males. It's inherent. One male for 100 females is more viable than one female for 100 males.

Tying this back to how I feel: I'm not rich, I'm not smart, I'm not talented, I'm not anything that gives a male value. I'm dirt poor, uneducated, and lazy. I think of killing myself everyday, but I have not yet the balls to do it. 

This post isn't really a question of how to deal, but rather how to accept knowing that I am expendable. I want to fully come to terms with it, and I'd like some insight from anyone, particularly older men, who have perhaps realized the same thing.",OneY

How to deal with an oversensitive penis head?,"My penis head is very sensitive, and touching it is very unpleasant. It's almost like it's painful, but the feeling is not that strong. It's just uncomfortable and unpleasant.

If I retract my foreskin, and let the head dry for a few minutes, touching it doesn't feel unpleasant at all.

I don't think that this is a medical issue. Is there a way to desensitize it a little bit? Or is it actually normal to feel unpleasant when touching your dickhead?",OneY
Just found this Sub and I think it's a good place to vent about some issues I'd like to discuss regarding dating.,"So I'm a 23 year old guy, I have a great stable career, live alone in a great city, have an active social life with great friends and honestly not too much to complain about and ultimately much to be grateful for. However I'm finding myself increasingly growing intolerant to how I've been treated when it comes to Dating and dealing with women who seem to just constantly disregard my efforts. I feel like as a man I'm expected to initiate all contact, plan every interaction etc... And it's starting to just feel like I'm pulling teeth to try and make anything resembling a healthy romantic relationship and it's getting very disheartening. It's only made worse when the classic trope of female friends i have say comments like

""How are you still single"" and ""what happened with X girl""

I'm starting to become very distrustful of women because I can't seem to get a grip on why they literally tell me that I have so many wonderful qualities but at the end of the day they don't really care about me enough to a want deep emotional connection. 

I've had many women in different words tell me that that because I come off as a ""player"" due to my extroverted characteristics that I couldn't possibly want a real emotional connection and are just looking to have sex with them. In reality I don't like casual sex, I don't like going out to bars and clubs and trying to pick up girls who most of the time I rarely have anything in common with and would much rather just want to have a best friend who I'm romantically involved with.

I'm just saddened by the fact that I have so much I know I can offer and have it all being pushed back in my face for showing it. I've learned that vulnerability is a sign of strength and not one of weakness, so with that in mind I'd love to hear your guy's thoughts, opinions and any advice you have to input about this sort of thing.",OneY

"My love language is touch. My wife only touches me willingly to cut my hair or put sunscreen on my back. I'm pretty sick of the neglect, open to suggestions.","I feel like a bitch just posting this because that's how I've been made to feel. Like a needy, whiny little man, none of which I feel normally fits me. But how long do you go without having your needs met without saying something about it? 

Now I just straight up ask for sex because for some reason to her touching me for that is more justifiable, which I dislike. We have sex maybe once a week but I've quit asking for the most part. 

The resentment toward her is hard to overcome some days and I have no idea how we got here. She just straight up hates being close to me, says its cause I move around a lot. She has no issues asking the dog to cuddle with her though (he's a  50lb puppy, with annoying amounts of energy).

At this point in time I'd almost hope she was cheating just so SOMETHING would make sense. I would move heaven and earth for this woman and apart from my own issues (everyone has a couple) she's always on my mind. I'm pretty positive she's not cheating (at least physically) but I'm equally positive whatever the issue is with me she's not being open about. 

Is there a book or something out there explaining how men look at intimacy? Whenever I try and explain it I fall short, nothing changes. She doesn't care. She fails the ""put yourself in others shoes"" test 9/10 times with me. No, she's not a sociopath - she cares a lot about other people, just not me. 

Anything is helpful. I'm pretty frayed right now.

All of that aside I will post an update in the future if I'm able to work anything out or switch up my circumstance. Above all it's important to note that I love and adore my wife. She's an amazing person with or without perfect compatibility. I think the vast majority offer input with that being the assumption, rather than just suggest I go elsewhere with my needs or desires. I appreciate the respect you've shown for us both. ",OneY

I was sexually harassed on Halloween and it's really bothering me,"On Halloween, a girl dressed as Rosie the Riveter, a feminist icon of all things, kept coming up to me and stroking my body in a sexual way and getting very close. The first time I said ""Hands off please"" and she walked away. My wife saw this and said jokingly ""did you make a girlfriend""? And I explained to her what happened, a bit razzled and freaked out. 

The lady did it to me again... 4 times. Every time we crossed paths she started stroking me. It made me very uncomfortable and not in control. The 4th time I yelled at her and she seemed to not know who I am, presumably drunk or on drugs. Then I spent the whole night avoiding her. My wife said something like ""I would have stood up for you but I didn't want to get in the way of her claws"" or something like that.

I'm having a hard time processing this because everyone I've told has really just passed it off but it really made me feel vulnerable and violated. I told my wife that I thought if I was a woman people would take this more seriously, but she said even when it happens to women people don't take it seriously. That's probably true. 

I just don't know how to process through it. I messaged the lady telling her what she did and not to approach me again. But I just feel nasty and unnerved that nobody stuck up for me, not even my wife.

Update: I did talk to my wife about it. It was a good conversation and we worked through it. She's really great and supportive, just learning how to deal with the unusual situation. Thanks for the support. It's nice to have a respectful and reasonable community like this.",OneY

My Girlfriend Left me Today; A Poem.,"A brief overview.  She's broken up with me twice prior, but this is about today.  On Thursday she told me she loved me.  Then didn't respond to any text, snap chat, Facebook, phone call, or Instagram until today.  She blocked me on all of them.  I sent this to her anyways because it made me feel better.

I know you can't hear me, I know.  I just hope writing it down helps.  I hope reading it aloud back to myself as I go does too.  I haven't felt like this since I was was a kid.  Since I tried to kill myself, at eleven, twelve, and thirteen.  I wouldn't hurt myself now, not ever.  That's not the point I want to make.  What I want to say, not so much to you as to me is more than I can write.  Its expletives, its words of affirmation, its there's plenty of fish in the sea.  It's how could you let her go you fucking loser.  Its the world goes on.  It's you know you would never be happy so why did you try?  It's if you love her you'll let her go, let her find someone better.  It's a lot more expletives.  At the end of the day though, no matter what I say.  What I tell myself.  I feel live I've failed, like I wasn't good enough, the chorus, the motto of the youngest sibling.  I still love you.  I've always felt love can only exist if both parties feel it, but here I am, chanting it into the void.  I love you.

I was just broken up with and taking it pretty hard.,"i don't have anyone else I can talk to right now about this so  I figure at least you guys can listen. And if nothing else at least it'll get it off my chest. 


I'm 28 and my girlfriend just broke up with me. It's not my first relationship, but the past few I've had have ended with me being lied to or played, in other words ended poorly. That's why I was so happy when me and A(that's what I'll call her) started dating. We met at the bar I worked at and had a friends with benefits thing for awhile mainly because she went to school in another state. We got back in contact when she moved back, talked for awhile and then made it exclusive. She made me so happy. Happier than any other girl ever had. Every time I saw her I got those 'first love' butterflies in my stomach. She was perfect. Anyway long story short lately she'd got more and more distant and we hung out less and less. Plans we made fell through and I just felt she wasn't interested. We started fighting more, mainly from me being upset that she would blow me off for one reason or another. I fanally asked her if she wanted a relationship with me or not. She kept saying she didn't know, to which I replied that she couldn't not know, that any answer other than a yes meant no. All she said was ""I'm sorry Chris""

So now I sit here broken hearted, looking at the Halloween costume I bought for parties we were supposed to attend this weekend. I know I fell hard for her, and maybe a little too fast. I knew I had stronger feelings for her than she did for me. I knew she had the ability to really hurt me. I love her and can't stop thinking of all the amazing times we had together in the past and never will again. I hate it. I want her in my life so bad. My life is better when she's a part of it. She made me the happiest I'd been in 10 years. I hate this fucking feeling. I hate that she didn't want me. I miss her already and it's killing me.

[Serious] Need moral support so I could be better,"Hey everyone. Im in a such panic mode, i dont even know if something like this is accepted here so im sorry.
The story goes like this. Im a student in a second year and recently i got a girlfriend, that is my first and i genuinely love. Since the teenage years I noticed that i haven't been the same, and i constantly question life and my decisions. I always try to analyze what is normal in human behavior, or rather my behavior, and what is not. Simply put, i was in a dark place, had no confidence in myself until she showed up. Things started to get better and I even went to see a psychiatrist because I had a couple of meltdowns and just wanted to better for her. 
Time passed and everything seemed to be fine until we decided to have unsafe sex. It wasn't a decision, it was rather spontaneous, but it happened. I take all the blame, and till this day I punishing myself for not stopping and thinking for a minute. I wont get into the details, but fact is we had sexual intercourse without any safety. I didn't came inside her but I just know there's a chance. It happened on 11th October evening, and the next day i bought her the emergency contraceptic. Her period started on the 4th, so Im not sure of the chances of ovulation. But all this aside, there is a chance.
So why im i writing this? Because im panicking and I want to be strong. She said she had some mild stomach pain today, and I immediately assume the worst. I live with a constant fear and panic and not knowing untill her next period, If it comes up. I dont want to ruin her life. She likes her studies, she likes the way life is going more or less, but this could change everything and Im devasted. As for.me, I have no sense of direction in life. sometimes, over these past few days of waiting, I even thought maybe a child would give me a purpose, because besides her, i have nothing going on. Im not into my studies, im not into any hobbies. But im staying realistic and understand that it would be impossible to raise a child and have a normal life, or im just stressing so much, i cant imagine that. Normal being, spending time with her without worrying, getting a degree, travelling and so on. This might not make sense to.you, but its in my head constantly.
What I'm trying to say and ask. I am and was stupid. I know that, and you can tell me that again and again, I'll take that, because I know that im responsible. Im not running away from that responsibility, I'm not leaving her alone if the ""worst"" happens, even if we don't work out, I'll give all of me to her, to make it as easier as it can be for her. But I'm weak and afraid of that. Whenever I imagine it happening, having a baby, I'm shaking and stressing. The thought of telling my parents is scary, let alone telling hers. And shes from another city, which would even make things worse.. maybe someone has something to say, that could give me something to build on my strength in this and man the **** up. I want to be the best i can be if the worst happens, but it is hard to stay that way, when a situation like this comes up.. :(

For a long time I was so afraid of being creepy that I used to bend over backwards to avoid any appearance of anything that could in any way risk making anyone uncomfortable. Anything even remotely flirtatious, romantic, sexual, where if I misread anything I could be That Guy. But I took it much too far. So even women who've been actively interested in me and trying to make that very clear thought I wanted to keep my distance and keep our relationship as friends. So they gave up. Then I got more and more sad about being a lonely reject, blaming that on my own worthlessness.

I internalized fear of predatory/creepy behaviour and took it to an extreme, failing to recognise that there's nothing wrong with being attracted to someone and expressing that in a healthy, respectful way in an appropriate context. That sometimes flirting is fun, and nothing more than that. And if it is, that's fine too so long as everyone's comfortable and happy. So long as it's part of a respected set of possibly evolving boundaries expressed by words and body language. Sometimes you'll get it wrong or your exceptions of what's appropriate don't match theirs, because everyone's different. That's when you apologise like an adult, and accept that if they can't cope with you acting your best then ... that's their problem too.

But that's 20 years of learning, and I'm sure I'm not there yet.

I don't think there's any ""friend zoning"" (ew) there. Or that ""bad boys"" are the problem. I think it's partly an issue of my making, partly my upbringing, and partly systemic problems in our society. If pervasive harassment weren't such an issue and women weren't understandably afraid to express themselves clearly in some contexts, it'd be less of a problem. Because we wouldn't have to communicate over 4 layers of second-guessing and subtext and coded signals. If women could reasonably expect that saying ""that's sweet, but no, not interested"" would be taken as exactly that, respected, and dropped... we'd all be so much better off.


I think he landed up in the same resentful, lonely place. But he made it the womens' collective fault and refused to see his part in it. Because that's really hard.

The ""Friend Zone"" and such language is, IMO, an artifact of men unwilling to deal with ambiguity and their own role in their relationships with others.

[Discussion / Opinion] Deciding to be a parent,"This post may come off as insensitive or controversial please know that it isn't intended to be, I would honestly like to see discussion around this so I can see where the holes are in my thinking here.

When a pregnancy happens there is a large power shift over the lives of all three individuals to the mother.   She essentially has the following options:

1.  abort (for many many reasons)
2.  raise child single without telling father
3.  raise child single and force financial support from father
4.  raise child jointly
5.  adoption

There may be others but I think that likely covers the most common choices a woman gets when she discovers she is pregnant... some of those choices are obviously very difficult however they are there for her.

A mans choice on this subject seems to be:

1.  Insure pregnancy never happens

Since my thought is pregnancy only occurs when both allowed it to (sexual assault being an edge case that I'm not including here) I think that men need to have this balance corrected slightly.

What I propose is that when a woman finds out she is pregnant she is legally obligated to inform the father and he at that time has a very short window to either decide to be involved with this child or not.. if not he can sign paperwork waiving him of all parental privileges and responsibilities...  The purpose of the short time line is so the woman then has all options available to her (including abortion) minus the forcing the father to be involved.

I think with something as life changing as becoming a parent that both parents should have equal say in if they want to make that step.   This doesn't completely level the scale obviously because if the father wants the child and mother does not there is nothing the father can do to avoid an abortion -- however I can't think of any legal way you could force a mother to carry a child she didn't want to term... so this is something that I don't believe can be solved.

This makes the new choices for women:

1.  abort if she doesn't wish to be a parent (or if there is a medical reason, etc)
2.  raise jointly if father wishes to be involved
3.  raise single if father wishes not to be involved
4.  adoption

New choices for men:

1.  legally abort via loss of parental rights if he doesn't wish to be a parent.
2.  raise jointly if you wish to be involved
3.  adoption

Left my GF of 4 years,"Hey guys

I don't even know if this sub is supposed to be like 2X. I thought maybe it was. So I decided maybe it was an ok place to go and rant about my life, hoping that getting it all out would help me.

I can't talk about all this to my male friends, even though they would not make fun of me you know how we are conditioned not to share feelings and such.

So yeah, I'm 20, been with my GF for 4 years, since high school. Still in love with her. But we have both changed a lot, we don't have a lot in common anymore. We don't do things together, don't think alike, don't want the same future. I'd say she even sometimes pisses me off.

So yesterday I decided to take this matter into my own hands, and talk about it. Had been thinking about it for a while. She 100% agreed with me. We know it's better for us as individuals. I've been puking and crying since, the feelings are still there, and I feel empty, like nothing matters.

I stayed at my parent's last night, I'm currently at work, everybody thinks I'm sick (I was this weekend). I can't get my mind straight. I'm a CS engineer so I just pretend to be working, noone will really notice, and my boss told me that I can just go home if I wish (don't want to, I've already missed a day and a half being sick).

I don't even know what's the point of my post, just needed to let a bit of it out, because it really fucks me up more than I thought it would.

Intact vs circumcised men when it comes to orgasms.,"The profiles of each are pretty predictable. Not universal, of course, but the pattern is undeniable.

Intact guys are most similar to each other. They reach a high plateau relatively quickly through penile stimulation and stay there for the duration of sex. They have great feedback from their penis and control over when they climax. When they reach orgasm, it is pleasurable from their toes to their head; full-body orgasm. Many can orgasm multiple times in a row, like within a minute or two without stopping. And climax doesn't slow them down; it's pleasurable to keep going (working the foreskin).

Circumcised guys start off at a low pleasure level and stay there most of the time they ""work"" through sex. The goal is to ""accumulate"" enough stored stimulation to make it over the climax hump. As orgasm approaches, they have little warning; seems like 5 seconds on average, and once it's coming, it can't be aborted. (Unlike with intact guys.) Orgasm is intense because compared to the chore of getting there, it's briefly much more pleasurable. Cut guys want to stop the action the minute they come, because the glans has become hypersensitive in ejaculation. This is because the natural neuroinhibitors in the foreskin, that communicate with the glans, have been cut off in circumcision. Most of the circumcised guys I've been with want no further activity in the seconds and minutes after they climax. They don't multiple-orgasm.

Furthermore, to get cut guys to orgasm you have to discover what sensitivity they have left after circumcision. Each circumcised man is different. Some need the glans touched, some need the glans NOT touched. Some need the (keratinized) inner foreskin remnant stimulated, some need their circumcision scar touched, some need their frenulum remnant stroked, and some have so little feeling in the penis that they come only through stimulating their balls.

In contrast, it's relatively straightforward to get an intact man off. The key is to remember that the glans stimulates the inner foreskin, not the other way around. Also, light pressure downward on the frenulum and light touch everywhere on the distal end of the penis (except directly on the glans) will produce reliable results.

It's telling that most circumcised men masturbate with a full fist grip, while most intact guys wank with just 3 fingers. The ""death"" grip makes reaching orgasm harder and harder over the years.

Many of have have found circumcised guys to be just too much work. Getting them to climax takes much of the pleasure out of sex, once you know what natural, intact sex is like.",OneY

Worried about getting gf pregnant. Would appreciate some advice.,"So I only get her to see a few times a year. I am currently deployed. We are not yet married. Things got a bit heated and we ended up having sex without protection. While we were going at it, I suddenly realized that there was some sort of white clumpy discharge on my penis. I thought I had maybe ejaculated. The texture felt really different and it vanished between when rubbed between the fingers. She said she had applied some lotion after getting her wax yesterday.

I then put on a condom and came about 5 mins later. Still slightly worried about it, we ended up taking the plan B two days later. Also, this happened 4 days before her period was due.

She is now 4 days late. I'm of course going to do everything I can if things go south but I am really far away and deployed and its freaking me out that she is dealing with all by herself.

Any sort of input is appreciated.

Most men don't know they have a circumcision scar.,"

Most men don't know they have a circumcision scar. Because of the common myths about circumcision, when they hear about a scar they look in the wrong place.

It's popularly believed that the foreskin is just a loose, useless piece of skin and circumcision removes all of it, leaving a clean, streamlined penis. Like tearing off a wrapping at a perforation and discarding it, leaving the whole product intact.

The truth about infant circumcision is that it's very messy, imprecise and not standardized in any way. Each circumcised boy has a variable, subjective amount of penis skin removed because the foreskin is not a discrete, identifiable structure. ""Foreskin"" is the name for what a great, specialized portion of the penile shaft skin does, just like ""lap"" and ""fist"" are not things that a surgeon can identify and remove. Foreskin is what it does, not what it is.

As such, infant circumcision removes a large amount of outer penile skin and most of the inner skin (mucosa). But it has to leave a cuff of mucosa because of the devices used. This cuff is then everted (flipped backward) onto the shaft and heals up against the remaining half or so of outer shaft skin. This becomes the site of the scar; the ring scar of circumcision around the shaft. Often so little skin is left after circumcision that for the two ends not to rip apart at the scar, skin is permanently pulled up onto the shaft from the scrotal area. This causes some webbing in childhood and a hairy base of the shaft after puberty. Doesn't feel good or natural inside a vulva.

Because it is popularly and mistakenly believed that the foreskin is a ""flap"" rather than a complex, fused, double layer of skin, many guys assume that the foreskin scar will be minimal and in the vicinity of the glans (head).

Most circumcised guys have a raised corona, the rim at the edge of the glans. (Corona is Latin for crown)  Most circumcised guys I've spoken to about circumcision scars initially thought that their corona was the scar. I'd say this is the most widely held view initially among American boys and young men. It never occurs to them that the ring discoloration on their shaft is their circumcision, because that would suggest a whole different, more extensive operation. (Which it is).

The everted cuff of mucosa is a lifelong scar, like the glans, after circumcision. It also dries out and keratinizes, losing the important functions that only moist mucous membrane tissue has.

Guys also don't know what's going on under the scar, which is really frightening. Circumcision in infancy causes a rapid and extensive healing process involving dense collagen fibers that serve to anchor the scar unnaturally to the shaft, further limiting skin movement beyond what the excision of half the skin did to it.

So, forgive guys for not knowing. They're looking in the wrong place. First they are certain they have no scar; then they mistakenly take the corona for being a very tidy scar; then they realize what the shaft ring is and become defensive.

Does anyone else find things never get easier and that money is always an issue?,"Sorry, this is probably going to be really rant like but just need to get this out there...

I am a happily married father of three in his mid forties living in the UK.  I work hard and earn an above average wage.  My wife has previously been a full time carer of our three kids all under 5YO.  

Money, it's always money!  I've never been good with money and have a few debts but they're in control and not costing fortunes.  That doesn't matter because we have so little money to go around and I don't care what they say, money doesn't buy happiness but it makes things much easier, that's for sure.  

I rent privately and worked out today 44% of my monthly wage goes on rent.  Add council tax, water, gas, electric, food, formula, nappies, petrol, insurance, internet, phone bills etc and we are left with.....£32.50 a week.  If any top up shops are needed or kids need clothes, that's gone!  

I have turned in to a virtual social recluse, can't afford to go out with friends, can't go to lunch with the guys from work or drinks after work.  Can't buy anything I want.  

I used to earn more as I worked two evenings as week on top of my 40 hours a week 9-5 but finishing at 2am and getting to work the next day was taking it's toll.  

Now my wife has to go out and work, 3 evenings a week which means we see each other for 15 minutes on those three days.  My youngest son is six months.  It's just not fair!  

I pay £800 a month combined tax and NI but qualify for no assistance what so ever.  

Then, in the last two weeks, the wife got a parking ticket, i need a new tyre and my car's MOT is due....

There's a better job going at work which i've been told I should apply for as it'll be more money.  I don't want it!  Don't want it at all, the hassle that comes with it will ruin my day.

I know things will get better now the wife is working as far as money is concerned but we'll just see less of each other and it feels like I work hard, suffer for it and get no reward.  I'd love to know where that £800 in government contributions goes cause I could really do with some of that right now!

"STD tests are negative, but experiencing penile discharge! Help?","Only in the mornings most of the time, after I don't pee for hours. I've been tested by two different doctors, both to no avail.

The AAP's basic failure on the topic of circumcision is this,"The AAP's basic failure on the topic of circumcision is this: They asked and answered the wrong questions. On purpose. 

A normal approach for doctors would be this 1-2-3:

1. Why do males have a covered glans? (What are all the possible reasons? How did this evolve to be the default state?)

2. What is the complete makeup of the foreskin? (Does it have muscle tissue? Veins? Nerve endings? Mucosa? In what proportions? And why?)

3. Does foreskin/glans separation and prepuce amputation cause harm to the penis and any other parts of the body? (Up to and including the brain)

Instead, the mercenary medicos approached the subject ass-backwards and expected the public to go along:

1. Can an infant endure this surgery? (And can it be done quickly enough so as not to inconvenience the doctor?)

2. Is a male still able to pee and procreate in a circumcised state? (Since we assume the foreskin itself serves no purpose. We don't know; none of us has one.)

3. Who is going to pay us? (We'll stress in our ""research"" that it's imperative that the government and private insurance never cut circumcision subsidies to parents.)

This is blatant medical malpractice. It's negligence and malfeasance by those entrusted to know and practice medical ethics. The right way to approach the question of genital cutting is not elusive. It's obvious -- to anyone with common sense and not driven by bias and greed.

We are lucky to live near a large park, though we don't go very often. Today we had a chance to bring our dog there, and the plan was that I would jog the perimeter while my girlfriend played with the dog. 

So I ran, and it took about 30 minutes for me to return. Upon my return my girlfriend was locked in the car, in tears. She said three drunk men had approached her and the grabbed our dog. She then went back to the car and they followed her, and proceeded to open doors to the vehicle when she unlocked it and got inside. She yelled at them to stop and they walked away. 

She, and our dog are very shaken. I can't imagine the terror she experienced and needless to say I'm buying her pepper spray. Two things have crossed my mind.

Females favouritism for other females in the workplace and world of education,"Please do not consider this a sexist rant but merely a discussion .Has anyone experienced this before, I believe I have experienced this on multiple occasions (from my perception). 

I am usually talkative and pleasant to work with however I have noticed that female managers seem to be more trusting and friendlier to other members of staff who are also female to the point were it becomes quite unfair. 

There have been moments where I could hear one of my managers converse with the other ladies with such a friendly tone and then switch to an almost unforgiving stern tone when addressing myself usually asking me if there is something I should be doing when trying to join in on the friendly conversation.

There have been times when I have been left to deal with a lot of work to make up for the brief occasions of absence of my female colleagues. Also times were I work a little harder because because others are not keeping up with the workload best they could however if it were the opposite way around I would be getting an earful about not doing my job. 

Not just jobs however , I found that in school some female teachers seemed to be more attentive and more hospitable towards female students and to a point some male teachers were the same . I would find this to be especially more prevalent for female teachers who taught classes like P.E or Maths or any type of subject that would usually (and of course wrongly) be considered a ""boy"" subject. I found that boys were more likely to get in  more trouble for the same things than girls I.e swearing or talking in class.

Men's fears of women,"I’m working on a book about “men’s fears of women.”  That women are afraid of men is well known.  Men’s fears of women are more hidden.  We hide them from others and from ourselves.  Some of these fears include: being dependent on women, being unable to please our partners, and being abandoned.
Please take a look at my initial posting, add any thoughts you have, and please forward this to anyone else you think might be interested.

I lost my fiancé and my best friend today... please help! I am not in a good place....,"We have been engaged for almost a year and dating a little over that. Her family held a large engagement party ~500 people were everyone she knew came. We got engaged pretty rapidly, but thought it would fit our schedules and were madly in love. Today she called off the engagement and wedding because of the urges of her family. We were supposed to get married in November, so roughly 2 months away. Everything was great until around May when I gave her some news that upset her family. I have severe anxiety and it has affected my career. We are both in the same career going to different schools and I am a bit behind because of the stressors I had in my life. I kept the full details from her and her family until May and they didn't take the news well and think of me as a liar... That is a story for another time.    
Anyway, we both had an exam that we needed to take and she was able to take hers without any issues, but I have been postponing due to my anxiety. This put a huge strain on our relationship. She hasn't been very supportive and doesn't understand why I struggle. She thinks I cannot handle stress and her mother especially was having difficulty with our possible marriage. They are very career and education driven. Her mother is pretty controlling and runs her life and it has frustrated her on many occasions. Her mother controls her through fear and intimidates her. Out of respect and our culture she refrains from disobeying her. She often tells her mother everything including details of our relationship. She lied for me to her mother when I postponed my exam (something I feel her mother did not need to know) and this caused her a lot of stress. Until recently she told me she would stay with me through thick and thin. I know she loves me, but there are a lot of issues that conflict like our families don't get along and we also live far apart from one another. I was supposed to take my exam tomorrow, but had to postpone again due to all the stresses that have crept up. I am seeing a counselor and have been getting help, but she doesn't think it is enough and she doesn't know if she can be there for me. She has been saying she wanted to postpone the wedding, but didn't give details until today out of fear of me doing bad on the exam.    
Throughout the planning process she was very much unhappy with how my family was handling arrangements, since the wedding would be were I lived. Her and I didn't have much time for arrangements with our busy schedules and allowed our parents to handle details. She has always wanted to plan out the wedding herself and figured she would have full control. We are both very close to our parents and very much dependent on our families. It seems that she had been contemplating calling off the wedding and even engagement for several weeks, but only made it known to me last week. Over the weeks she often gave me hope and told me things would work out, but it was all a charade in order to keep it from affecting my studies. She had planned on breaking it off all along. Even though she tells me she loves me, she told me in the coldest way possible. She provided excuses and reasons why we shouldn't get married and kept reiterating that ""isn't it for the best?""... She told me she felt sorry, but it didn't feel like it. It felt so insincere and cold. My heart hurts. She told me I deserve someone better and someone that would care and love me unconditionally. She started saying that she wasn't sure wanted to be with me or just the thought of having someone that loved her as much as I did. I feel so broken and I really don't know what to do. She told me she wants to continue talking as friends and that once I get everything in order maybe we can see how things go, but it sounded so hollow. It seems like she already shut the door to having any future with me. We really thought we would spend the rest of our lives together...    
tl;dr My fiance broke off our wedding and engagement in one week because of her family and left me a broken mess.

My sister is being passive aggressive around my Girlfriend?,"My Girlfriend (23F) and I (21M) have recently returned from the United States after 3 months and am staying at my dad's place until we can move into our own place. He is away every second week and so we effectively have the house to ourselves every second week. My job starts tomorrow so as soon as I am able I will move into our own place. We are introverts and are friendly.

My little sister (16) has been going through some rough times lately; my parents have been divorced for a while and my mother has already moved in with her now husband about 30 minutes drive from my sister's school. My father lives 5 minutes from her school and has been sacrificing not living with his fiance so that my sister can finish school (1.5 years left), and therefore have put a strain on his relationship as his fiance lives about an hour away. My mother will have my sister every second week and drive her down, except when it doesn't suit her. For example today is supposed to be her week and my girlfriend and I were going to just relax because I have work tomorrow and we've had a really rough week not to mention being jet lagged and she has cramps. My mother is getting a scan for migraines today so my little sister is staying with us at my dad's. We don't mind having her considering the circumstances but my sister has been very passive aggressive to us lately.

My father deserves to spend his week with his fiance and my mother should follow through and have my sister. In this case it is understandable, but my girlfriend and I are still run down. I know that my sister and dad were very close and she lashed out a little bit when he was spending more time with his fiance. I was out all day preparing for my work tomorrow and when I got home at 5ish we had dinner and watched Matilda with my sister. As my girlfriend went to the bedroom so we could relax my sister started asking if I was going to clean up my mess in a passive aggressive tone, then commenting on the messy kitchen, then asked what we were doing tonight and I said that my girlfriend had cramps and that we were tired and just wanted to chill out and wind down before tomorrow. My girlfriend is spending the day with my sister tomorrow while I'm at work.

My sister asked if we could go out to a movie, keeping in mind that my girlfriend and I are broke for now, and that we're exhausted. My little sister said ""You are always 'chilling out' and I feel like I'm alone in this house all the time"" in a very passive aggressive voice. My girlfriend watched the bachelor multiple times since we arrived with my sister to bond with her, we've watched movies together and taken my sister out. She seems to be lashing out and I understand that the circumstances are making her lonely; she's also not getting along with her friends, but in this situation as a young couple it doesn't seem very fair that we have to be made to feel guilty for just wanting to relax when in stead we have to basically be in a parenting role. 

I know my sister did similar things when my dad spent time with his fiance so maybe it could be a similar thing, but she's been very passive aggressive to the both of us, even talking over my girlfriend at times. I want the two of them to get along but I feel like I'm in a very difficult position and I shouldn't have to feel guilty for spending time with my girlfriend.",OneY
Ideas for a baby shower with the boys!,"Hey guys, long time listener, first time caller. I am a woman and I gotta tell you, this is one of my favorite communities out there and I hope you don't mind me posting!

Growing Up with a Feminine Father,"Hey all,

I grew up with a father who possesses feminine tendencies. He privately cross-dresses, is probably bi, and speaks with a high, soft voice. I believe that all this was caused by his mother, who I believe feminized him (my grandfather had a deep voice for example). It seems that in my fathers childhood home, him and sister were pitted against their father, and I think my grandmother had a problem with men, and passed that down to kids. A habit that carried onto adulthood. Even as I was growing up, my grandmother showed no interest in me, but she did show plenty of interest in my female cousins. And my father never showed any interest in teaching me masculinity.

I know that many straight men who cross-dress, counter balance it with hyper masculinity, however my father doesn't doesn't act very masculine, nor care for masculine things. He acts nothing like the fathers of my more masculine friends. He even has a friend who crossdresses as well, but his friend respected his son's masculinity, and his son turned out normal.

For example: many fathers are eager to pass along masculine hobbies to their sons. My father didn't. My father did learn how to fix things, but it never occurred to him to teach me. He makes feminine gestures (like he'll wave in a feminine way, I used to scold him for waving like the Queen of England); and because of his high voice, I completed puberty with a voice that is 9 octaves over normal (I have no way to fix it when I was a child my voice was deep, but due to mimicking my father speech pattern, I crossed puberty speaking with a high voice like his). Being called ma'am on the phone is annoying, especially when people outright say: you sound like a girl.

Don't get me wrong, I do love my father. He is a highly intelligent man, and I'm always grateful I inherited that.

Because of all this, I'm often mistaken for gay. People outright ask me, and other feel uncomfortable around me because they assume I'm gay. I find myself being forced to prove I'm straight as soon as I meet people. I don't follow sports, I can't fix things, and I lack many masculine qualities. It's impacted my dating life, and my self-esteem. Like I said, nothing is worse than being asked in front of a room full of people if you're gay, or having people call you ma'am or say you sound like a girl.

Someday, I want a children and I don't want to pass this down to my son.

My questions are:

Can anybody relate to having a feminine father or a mother who feminized them? How has it impacted your life?

Men with high voices who have children, did your sons inherit it too?

What have you done to overcome ""feminine"" tendencies?

Can anybody relate to people thinking they're gay?

Has it impacted your dating life?

Thanks all. Today I was seen holding my lunch bag around my forearm. Someone in my job told me never to do that again. I honestly did it because I usually have to carry a few things and it kept my hands free, but considering many people assume I'm gay, it doesn't make things easier.

Thanks all!

My Wife Doesn't Support Me.,"I'm not even sure how to write this post. 

I have married a woman who doesn't support my dreams - who is always negative when it comes to my desires and ambitions. 

She doesn't want to move away from family to better our lives. She doesn't want to stop supporting her mother financially ( which we are struggling now ). I have asked her to please stop so we can get ahead and she crys when I tell her we can't do it anymore for a while until we get caught up with our own personal affairs. 

She feels like I'm always bringing up the same things talking about our finances but she never does anything about it or has enough courage to tell her mom no. When we are struggling to make ends meat because she pays all of her mom's bills at an entirely separate home. I don't mind her supporting her to some extent but not when it makes us struggle and me have panic attacks because we lack the resources to pay certain bills. - she has no desire to change this and said she will always do it. I can't handle it anymore. 

She has ZERO desire or drive. She doesn't push me or encourage me and is always a negative person. She has no ambitions in life and is always downing or never supportive of things I would like to do in life that would allow her to have the things she wants in life. She wants a lot in life which is fine, but her lack of desire to support me and push me and make me feel like I'm worth something or doing something right for my family is hard breaking to me... she is pushing me away and doesn't even know it. She wants what she wants and has no desire to give me the things I want. She is not what I imagined a wife would be - I take care of everything - I pay all the bills and even take care of around the house - and when I ask her to take care of things around the house she neglects it or gets upset or pouts because I ask her to do things - like washing dishes. 

I could go on - and i know I'm not a walk in the park but I support her and our family to my best ability - and when I complain I'm made to be the bad person because I'm wanting to improve.

Question about treatment of poor men and women.,"I made a comment elsewhere on Reddit where I said average man treats poor women differently from how poor men are treated by average women. 

I got downvoted without an explanation and a few female rediditors just resorted to attacking me instead of making an argument.

This got me curious if there's any reality to that. I've read few articles about a study in UK which claimed millennial women are less sympathetic towards unemployed men. 

Since there were no counterarguments I'm curious if there is any.

why I am against infant circumcision,"let me put it this way. People can live (and many have lived) without their eyesight, or like my girlfriend, without hearing. They can do many things, for deaf people they can almost do everything a person who can hear can.
but... why would anyone take someone's vision or hearing from them for no reason at birth? Or an arm, or a finger?
It won't kill them, but it will deprive them of things that they SHOULD have had access to (like the ability to appreciate music, or paintings).. or in the case of cutting off a finger, the ability to play an instrument like a guitar.
so by saying that you should be able to cut off part of someone, you are saying that their access to that part that you cut off is less important than the reason you cut it off. That is called medical amputation (I cut off my arm cause I was stuck between a rock and would die if I didn't move). And just so you know, ANYONE (not just doctors) can do a medical amputation. The guy in 124 hours did a medical amputation on himself.
Cutting off a part for no immediate reason isn't amputation, it is mutilation.
therefore, circumcision is infant genital mutilation. No matter if the genitals are male or female.",OneY
Recent thought about my past and wondering if I was molested.,"First off , hello everyone ! I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to post this . 

I have never really thought about what I believe was the time I was molested and it just passed my mind mostly.
Recently when meeting up with an old very good friend mine, I tried ecstasy for the first time with him and it was a brilliant experience which I won't try again (please do not judge me). We were sitting on a bench in a park at 4 am and I felt so comfortable. About 30 minutes into a conversation with him I decided to tell him that I was molested to which he was very comforting about and we never spoke of it after. I have never told anyone apart from him and never speak of it to anyone.

When I was about 4 or 5 (I am now 19) I Was being babysat by a family friend , she was 18 at the time I'm sure. I can fondly remember one such occasion were I had been in a room with my sister who was minding her own business, (she is 2 years older) when I was playing with this babysitter/family friend and she had touched my penis with her hands in my pants for a brief moment. At the time I thought it was funny and I remember laughing and she laughed too , and she did it once more and that was the end of it. I don't really remember her name and I have moved about so much that it would be impossible and inappropriate I feel to tell my family.

It's just recently been in my mind , it's not disturbing me or making me sad. I'm just wondering if I really was molested? I'm also wondering if I should be feeling disturbed ? Is it normal not to ? Should I talk to anyone about this or if it's not annoying me should I just leave it? I'm doing a lot of good things with my life at the moment and I don't want this to suddenly all come down on me like some mental break if that ever happens. Has anyone had a similar experience?

Noticing changes in my body...,"Hey guys! I've noticed something odd about my body the last couple of weeks, and wondered if anyone here had any ideas.


FWIW, I'm 29, soon to be 30. In pretty good shape. Been working out for about two years now. Been maintaining a pretty good diet for those two years as well. I did start cutting at the beginning of July, which really means I'm just eating way less trying to shave off some body fat (started at 15% body fat, down to 13%!)


Anyway, over the last two weeks or so, my libido has skyrocketed to the point of being distracting. I've actually had a bunch of chest hair start popping up all over my chest, and shaving/trimming has turned into a daily thing, where it used to be once a week (I maintain some scruff, but keep my neck shaved). This really feels like puberty round 2, but without all the acne (so far anyway) or cracking voice.

A bad dream about my past.,"This memory happened a long time ago during my teenage years. And I don't really know why it came back all of a sudden, as I've been in a relationship that's leaps and bounds healthier for quite awhile already too. But I am having trouble getting back to sleep and I'd like to share this.

So my ex used to talk to me about her male friends' chat topics when they hangout without me around (Gay/straight/bi/whichever) I'm ok with it most of the time, but there were times where she would bring up their chat topics related to their penis size, their ejaculation amount, libido(to do things in public) and whatever else along those topics; and then she would do a roundhouse kick by asking me why am I not like ""that"".

So in the dream, I was chatting to a good friend who has/had my ex as a FB friend and said that she was bringing all these things up publicly and insinuating them all towards me - Now that I'm less bothered with how the public categorises me, I'd just laugh and try to forget about it.

But it was a horrible feeling, bringing out the most insecure aspects of myself, it still is a little unsettling. But I'm glad it's all over, and that I'll never allow myself to experience anything like that again.

It'd be nice to hear from a stranger, whether it seems like I'm being overly insecure about myself; otherwise, thanks for reading.",OneY

I can find some specific points related to the experience:
- I don't feel serious enough. Until now, I've never had a 'proper job,' not one that warrants a suit anyway. Anyhow, some part of me feels other people will see that I'm acting phoney and see right through me.
-I don't feel 'masculine' enough. On the outside I look masculine enough. But inside I still feel like a kid and not a man. It makes me feel uncomfortable, and I'd much rather wear jeans and shirts etc
-... the fit wasn't right. In the end I'm just going to have to visit a proper tailor and make sure the damn thing fits my body shape. This kind of relates to the above two points. In reality I have no damn clue what I'm doing in relation to sartorial judgments haha.

How to balance being assertive and being agreeable?,"So I felt like I had to request a raise, because my rent is going up maybe 5% every year.

After being told this would happen aa agreed ""next week"" for two months, I felt like I had to threaten to quit in a month I didn't receive the new contract by then or else it wouldn't happen.

After the end of the month long period approached with nothing changing I felt like I had to explain the situation to upper management so they wouldn't be caught by surprise when I quit, and so they wouldn't hear the story only from one side.

Despite new promises (but no paper) of a raise and new contract, when the end of the month came I felt like I had to quit to stay true to my word.

Except now people I respect are telling me that I'm being overly arrogant and agressive, and basically that I'm burning bridges. Also my former boss is telling me I made a huge mistake because this new contract/raise was set to go though this week. In fact he's even saying I should invoice the increased amount for the month of June. However since I quit I've ruined everything and there's no going back from that. He also wanted to meet tomorrow he says to clear up misunderstandings, with the understanding that I wasn't going to be made any new offer. Maybe we will meet on Thursday. I initially declined the meeting before thinking better of it.

So on one hand I've burned bridges by being stubborn, agressive, arrogant and generally disagreeable. On the otherhand if this happens all over again I'm not sure what I do differently.

I want to be liked of course. But I also need to pay my rent every month and I don't want to feel pushed around.

Clearly I messed up somewhere because now I have no job and on top of that people don't like me and I don't have a good reference to use. I just feel like a total failure right now, like I'm the worst of both worlds and no one in their right mind would want to work with me.",OneY

"""nice guys"" incels and redpill. My theories on them and how they're related based on my own experience.","Starting off with ""nice guys."" This is where I believe the issue starts with many if not most guys.  Now, If you haven't [Go and read this post. it is IMHO incredibly accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/569eho/why_feminist_dating_advice_sucks/)


But to TL;DR what I think the core of the issue for nice guys is. 

Fairy tale thinking and the demonization of male sexuality.

nice guys are conditioned to believe that their sexuality is bad. and expressing sexual interest is both creepy and unattractive.

This is where we get the ""women only go after douchebags"" What makes these men douchebags? They're flirtatious, Masculine and forward with their desires. This is the opposite of what ""nice guy's"" know to be true.  

and in order to avoid rejection, They have to act in the ""gentlemanly"" way. That is to hide your desires and be extra courteous. This is why fedora's and M'lady's are such a common trope. Because they have that association with ""old school"" gentlemen.

Donald Glover in his book. No More Mr, Nice Guy. States that the ""nice guy"" creed is something along the lines of. 

&gt;If I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be then I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life. Do everything right, don't rock the boat, don't be a problem, hide your flaws and mistakes and you will get the love and approval you're after.
The nice guy lives by this credo and if it is ineffective, he only tries harder.


now. After a few years of bitter rejection and loneliness after trying their hardest with what they know. 

Either that frustration, anger and eventually hatred. turns inwards. or it begins to flow outwards

Directed inwards is How we come to the Incel crowd. 

Your thoughts eat at you. ""why am I not good enough"" ""I'm doing everything I was taught to do, Why am I not loved?"" ""maybe I'm just a less than human freak and this world is shit"" They just keep coming, Constantly gnawing and chewing. devouring you crumb by painful crumb. 

This is why we see so much self hatred in the incel communities. They hate themselves for having been born into a life that in their eyes can only end in destitute loneliness. 

and yes, They focus on sex. But as much as we say otherwise, Sex and physical intimacy between human beings is an important interaction. 

This is watered down for most people. And they're generally looking for a higher standard of desire. But ask any incel. and they would likely tell you that they would prefer an abusive relationship to none at all. This is also why most incels would not settle for a prostitute. 

what they're looking for isn't basic sex. It's what sex entails. That connection and acceptance. 

Trust issues are a big part as well. With the tirade of negative thoughts. it's hard to trust that people actually like you. Maybe they just stick around out of pity? I can tell you from experience that it's much worse when that has actually happened to you. 

I find it incredibly difficult to genuinely trust people.


Then there's the last part to this triforce of terror. The Red Pill. 

I'm going to exclude cases where men have come to TRP due to negative experiences with relationships in the past. Because that is a significant part. 

What brings about the anger and hatred that people see in TRP. Is a feeling of being cheated and mislead. It's the feeling that the world doesn't want you to be successful. If it did, You wouldn't have been taught what you were in your youth. 

and one of the things that young men find in TRP groups first and foremost. is an outlet. They can scream and shout and complain as much as they want and nobody is going to give them trouble for it. I'm sure you've all seen what happens when they complain outside of that space.

this also means that the group is ""splintered"" ironically in many ways it's like feminism. You have your radicals. Rooshv for example. many people in TRP Dislike him. But the status quo of TRP groups is to live and let live. People are there for their own improvement. 

and that's the last part I'll adress. IF you're willing to sift through the anger and bitterness. There is some genuinely good advice within TRP. But it's not generally in a pleasant ""PC"" format. It's not meant to be. It's supposed to be an abrasive, bitter pill.

Severe ED - suicidal,"I'm not sure how much I feel like explaining here in detail but tonight was the first time (in my life) that I've ever actually felt so hopeless that killing myself actually seemed like a possibility.

The relevant points:
- 34 years old

- Never had sexual issues

- A year ago ended a 7-year relationship that had degenerated into a dead bedroom.

- Upon re-entering the dating world discovered that I had lost my ability to achieve or sustain an erection with a woman. Only with a woman; masturbation and/or porn were fine.

- Went to urologist who after many tests concluded my penis was in fact totally fine and testosterone levels while a tad low were fine. Proscribed erection-meds anyway (Cialis).

- Cialis didn't change anything.

- Spent some time with a sexual therapist (LPT). Didn't really achieve much of anything except for her suggesting that perhaps my years of reliance on porn may be related.

- Completely cut out porn (and masturbation for an extended period).

- Problems persisted.

- Depression/Anxiety began to compound the issue entirely.

- Sought second opinion for a different urologist; produced same result. This one prescribed Viagra.

- Viagra.... kinda worked... initially. I was able to achieve semi hard erections that allowed for some sex, but it just didn't feel right - very artificial. Even after a while the effect faded.

- Perhaps related, my overall libidio just began to plummet... I've begun to lose interest in women for fear (yes FEAR) that they would be interested in sleeping with me; I just don't want to deal with the awkwardness and depression that results from failed sexual encounters.

- Tonight had a (female) friend over who I've always been close with (she knows about my issues). We began getting intimate with each other... something I've wanted and fantasized about for a very long time. Our initial foreplay (including her rubbing my genitals) produced a very hard erection... however as soon as I began removing my pants (and she undressing) for intercourse it like hit me ""ohh I'm about to have sex"" and I instantly lost the erection.

For some reason: this was just too much for me. I quietly excused myself and went to the bathroom and just sat there for a long time thinking about how I don't want to go on like this anymore. I don't know what I can do or try that I haven't already. The intense feeling of hopelessness... the loss of my masculinity... this fear and weakness in me, a usually extremely confident man, it just made me feel like the person I used to be was already dead - and I didn't want to go on being the person I had become.

The intense desire to end it passed pretty quickly;but it was the first time I've ever felt that way before in my whole life.

I'm seriously completely without hope or direction here and just thought maybe writing all this out and putting out an SOS on reddit could provide some solace.

I’m a Straight Man and I Hate Giving Oral Sex,,OneY
My new GF is constantly invalidating my experiences and troubles because women have it worse. I'm getting to my limit.,"
* I'm still adding stuff at the bottom. I'm sorry this is such a negative post but I don't have any one I can talk to and I really need an outlet right now. I've struggled with pathologically low self esteem and writing all this out has made me realize I deserve better. 

Whenever a problem weighted in the male direction is brought up or when a man has a female oriented problem, she immediately, without missing a beat, will start invalidating it.

She's made it pretty clear she thinks that only women can have problems. 

I once said ""I hated being told to smile. Let me decide how I want to feel and express myself."" 

And her response was pure shock and disbelief that this could have ever happened to me. 

We were once talking about porn and the typical delivery guy trope. I then showed her a [funny gif](https://gfycat.com/WholeAcrobaticIberiannase) of how it would really go in real life. 

I then said ""that's really not okay though, that's sexually harassment"".
Immediately she starts saying ""how is that sexual harassment? She's just naked and being flirty?""

I responded saying I wouldn't feel comfortable if anyone answered the door naked no matter the circumstances and she kept resisting until I finally said, and I tried not to say this cliche thing, ""what if it were a man and not a woman?"". 

She immediately rolled her eyes and groaned and went to her phone. 
I then said ""what? You don't think that's sexual harassment?""
She didn't even look up and just flicked her hand at me and said ""it is, yeah"" as in a way to let me know she was done with this convo. 

It's so petty that I once hit my testicles and quickly, not too seriously, said ""downside of having genitals on the outside"" light heartedly. 

*Immediately* started to counter by making a quick groan then started to say ""oh yea?..."" or something similar to tell me how bad it is to have female genitals, but caught herself and stopped mid sentence.

The worst one which just makes me hurt more than anything.

I struggled with body image in high school for years. Anorexia and bulimia. I was drunk and we went to eat at a burger place when I let slip these problems in front of her. I made a comment of why I did it ""constantly seeing guys with abs in every movie, in every store front, on every bill board, and constantly hearing girls talk about how hot abs are"" she rolled her eyes in dismissal began to say something like ""that's not..."" then caught herself. 

She once claimed she was harassed at a restaurant when the waiter was annoyingly friendly and a guy offered to pay her dinner. Maybe it was worse in person, I don't doubt that. I don't doubt that it was probably harassment, but knowing her it wouldn't surprise me if she exaggerated it so she could rail against men. I really do believe her when she says she was harassed but, that's not the problem. She called me to tell me about what had happened and after finishing her story went 

""*mennnn*"" 

""*I don't get why mennn are that way*"" 

""*sometimes I can't stand men*""

But caught herself and was like

 ""I mean you're a guy and you're really nice, but you know?""

I'm always showing that I understand the issues and injustices women face. Not once has she shown *any* acknowledgement towards men's issues or has gone to invalidate them. 

There's so much more wrong with this girl, but this has been bothering me and needed to get it off my chest. *

Thanks for reading.


**decided to add it**

It gets worse, 


* she has unbelievable road rage. 

* One week in to dating  she called me to erupt about how her mother ""is a flaming bitch"", 

* Gets off on arguing  so much that I swear that she was gonna cum when she was in an email battle with her TA.
        Kept saying ""I love it when I'm in an argument and I know I'm right it so.... AHHHH"" while shaking in excitement. 

* Refused to tip more than 15% on a 8 dollar pizza delivery. I suggest she give 3 dollars as I think those jobs are rough especially food delivery and 3 dollars is a fair minimum despite the cost of the meal. 
       She got all worked up and said ""I'm not paying that much on tip, they chose to work that job."" Ohhhh yeaaahhh like he was so overjoyed that he gets paid barely above minimum wage. He just didn't *choose* a higher paying job. 

* Wants a 30k plus wedding non negotiable. 

&gt;without being prompted will say ""sorry for wanting to be a goddess for one day of my life""

* Cried inconsolably that she forgot the passcode to her new phone she got. 

* Uses small dick as an insult and makes small dick jokes 

* Constantly complains about anything and everything. Not one day passes she exclaims how she hates her life despite getting accepted to vet school and being very very very wealthy. 

* Thinks circumcision is okay because, I shit you not, ""it's just our culture."" 

* Everything I do annoys her. Everything I do is wrong. Just putting groceries away is like walking through mine field. 

* Has bitched non stop about her European study abroad where all she does is eat and see sites. It's a glorified vacation for credit.

* Despite knowing my eating disorders swoons over abs every time she sees them *right in front of me*

* In like the third date she was falling all over herself to point out a guy saying ""I know him his name is blah. He's the ridiculously hot guy"" then proceeded to wet the booth we were in telling me stories of times when she thought he was super hot. 

* Would hate having a boy because ""they're little out of control monsters. Girls are so well behaved."" Yeah like boys can't be well behaved too.

* This one is the one  that made me want to post. We were talking about middle school and I mentioned how it's a sexually confusing and angsty time. 
I then said something like
 ""I remember hitting puberty and then suddenly noticing girls were sexually developing."" 
She went, and I read the texts,
""Ewww stop, creepy af"" and said
 ""I don't want to think about how boys were staring at my friends and I develop."" 
How the fuck is going through puberty and becoming interested in the other sex creepy? 
Then said ""girls don't do that"" bullshit. 


So much more stories of how she's a whiny sexist princess but lastly....

What really happens to the male body as it ages?,,OneY
My brothers girlfriend has threatened the quality of life of my family and myself.,"My brother and I are in our mid 20's living at home and trying to find balance in our lives in order to move on with them. Various things have held us back, my brother is approaching a 10 year opiate addiction and is currently dependent on black tar heroin and xanax. This has unsurprisingly caused his life to spiral downwards into a place that he's had little to no success in climbing out of in terms of living a productive and healthy lifestyle. I suffer from apathy and have dropped out of potential careers and have difficulty holding jobs though I have been working for the past 6 months in attempt to save up and move out as well as to pay rent and other costs to carry my weight at home. My brother is working a inconsistent job with an unreliable work schedule that often forces him to go on unemployment pay which he has put off recently due to the hassle of it.

Our relationship growing up was conflictual in most of our years, I was a mean kid to him which I highly regret and feel it was out of my power when very young, I was closer to him in elementary school, grew apart in middle school, and reconnected towards the end of high school, I feel that my negative experiences have over shadowed our interactions with each other up until now.

We tend to always come back to reason and are able to interact like mature adults but almost without fail we will trigger one another with an event and regress back to our age old tactic of insulting each other with our life's biggest failures, it's a terrible thing but we're aware that it's what hits the hardest.

Currently we aren't on talking terms due to what I feel is one of the most inconsiderate and insecure girls I've ever known who happens to be dating my brother. This girl also lives at home even though she has a high paying job in the medical field, her parents are foreigners that don't speak english, don't shake the hands of her boyfriends when introduced, and are unable to remain calm when a guy is sleeping on the floor of her room. She likely has some issues because of this imo. Because of this they never go to her house but instead come to ours, every, single, weekend. At first it was refreshing to see my junkie brother have someone there for him when the rest of the family couldn't be, then we realized that this girl was in many ways a negative influence on not only him but the rest of our family.

This girl is so insecure that she will start yelling, within earshot of myself and parents, at my brother for viewing her best friends social media. Anything that has to do with another girl is a potential verbal engagement. At first I asked my brother, when we were initially on better terms, to make her stop doing it in our house, he tried but she wouldn't stop. Then I intervened mid argument and confronted both of them, it intimidated her but that's about it as I was furious and ended up in a verbal argument with my brother who felt he had to defend her. She didn't stop her behavior. At that point I went to my father as my mother is incapable of action in this matter and asked him to put an end to it, the thing is he isn't affected by the verbal exchanges as his room is far enough away to not hear it so he doesn't take my pleas seriously though he has and will tell my brother to ask her to leave on weekdays (she doesn't usually come over then) or on sundays as it leads to a work day. Asking him to intervene during a argument on a friday/saturday only results in my brother and his girlfriend in leaving the house to argue off site but they return. While it actually succeeds in getting her to leave she ends up coming back the next weekend and often brings her bad habits. 

Her other indecent habits include making cheap porn noises during sex, wiping her makeup off on the community bathroom towel, staying up late and making loads of background noise preventing me from maintaining a sleep schedule even when they aren't arguing, and not flushing after pissing in the toilet which happened to be why my brother and I aren't talking. I got pretty mad when I saw her stroll out of the bathroom while leaving a nice urinated pool of piss as a gift for me or my father to have the pleasure of dealing with, I directly went to my brother and said fix that shit and he got mad that I was making demands as he thought it was considerate that she wasn't flushing to not wake people up. They ignored it and let it ferment so I knocked on his door until he got triggered, he comes out and shoves me and I jab him in the cheek, we wrestle around and wake our parents up, I regret that the most as my goal is to solve this situation without bothering them, and then we part. I fucked my pec muscle up pretty bad when we were squeezing each others neck to choke one another and I haven't been able to lift though it's almost healed.

His girl didn't come over for a couple of weeks but lo and behold she returned this last one. They haven't argued in the last two weekends they were together at our home but they always have runs before going back to what they know. Now every time I see her I enter a highly stressed out state due to her past indecencies. It's a gamble whether my brother declares that he's together or broken up with her but she always comes over regardless, it must be freeing to do the shit she does here which I'm assuming she would never get away with in her home. 

Looking for some insight on how to deal with this situation in an optimal manner while not letting this girl get away with these antics seeing as how my father is unwilling to ban her outright which has somewhat to do with the fear of my brother getting even more into his heroin addiction were he not to have her as a distraction but more so due to the fact that he is immune to the sound and scenery they create during their conflicts.

TLDR: Brother's girlfriend threatening quality of life by being incredibly indecent, parents won't ban her from home as these antics affect mostly myself due to the proximity of our rooms, my intervention often results in verbal/physical conflicts and has caused my brother and me to not be on speaking terms.

Morning wood,not sure if this is a good place to post this but here it goes anyway. Im 20 and i recently realized i stopped getting my morning erections. Im not sure how long has it been but i feel like its actually been a while since i stopped having it. The weird part is i actually get an erection almost every morning maybe 10-15 mins after i wake up ussually after peeing. What should i do about it i heard its necessary for the health of the penis but im not even sure what the problem is. Could it be that my sleeping cycle got screwed up or is it maybe low T or something like that. I dont really have a problem with getting erections during the day so it didnt start screwing up my regular life. Atleast for now,OneY

"Why do I seek validation from girls, and how can I stop it?","I really don't know how to put it but I want to know what's wrong with me and maybe you can help me  Heres a little about me:  I'm a soon to be sophomore in college, pretty good looking guy standing at 6'1, tan skin, great smile and weighing in at a good 285 pounds. I've played football since the eighth grade and have been in the every top team my schools have offered for I have always had a lot of grit and produced great numbers in the weight room. I'm very good with people, and always been very liked by people but I think that's because I've always been super insecure about myself and that fueled my desire to always make sure people liked me.  I've had a couple of girls i talked to throughout high school (nothing serious) but they all have been very attractive so I know i can attract the ones i want but i've always had this fear of girls. Well not really a fear but more of a sensation of always having to please them or else they leave me. When i truly discovered this was in college, my freshman year I was able to befriend girls but always wanted to have sex and stuff with them (really because of social pressures now that i think about it) but never actually built a relationship with them. I have noticed that I seek for validation in girls so i always end up scaring them away and never get what i want. I have recently being studying a lot of guys on youtube such as RSD Tyler and Elliot Hulse about becoming a man and overcoming my insecurities. I have recently decided to start doing thins by myself a lot more like going to the gym and running errand to get more comfortable with my myself and really find out about myself and the problems i keep facing are me not having a girl to talk to and have sex with, and not having ANYTHING to do. I am on summer break, and have two and a half weeks before i head off to school again for fall camp, (i walked onto tvcc and made the football team) so i wont have to worry about the free time thing so much but i feel like im on the right direction.

Get back with her or severe all ties with her?,"    I am not sure if this is the right place to post, but there is something that I really wanted to get off my chest and get some feedback. I graduated college back in summer 2014, and found a great job in a far away state a few month later. It’s a 11 hour drive to move there but the pay is good and I get tons of benefits, my employer even paid me for the relocation. I am still working for the same company and this is also where I met my “ex-girlfriend”. We both got hired around the same time, went through the same training class, and work the same shift under the same manager. I didn’t talk much during training class or the first 2 weeks after training. 

    On the third week, my employer booked a restaurant nearby because the company CEO is visiting. All the employees are encouraged to go to the said restaurant after work to get free food/drinks and get a chance to speak with the CEO. Our entire team went there after our shift ends and we sat at the same table, this is where her and I had our first long conversation. “What’s the story with you?”, I still remember this was the first thing she said to me that night. I always been a shy person and I am only talkative around people I known for years, she asked me a lot of questions about myself and I never asked anything about her. The entire 3 hours we spent at the restaurant, she seems only interested in speaking with me, she asked me tons of questions about myself and I got get to know her a little better. She is two years older than me and she moved to this state two years ago. Although I didn’t ask her any questions, I did enjoy the 3 hours we spend together. She seems cool and she look attractive.

For the next two month at work, she is making in very clearly that she is interested in me. She flirts with me all the time, spends a lot of her time at IMing me using company IM. Occasionally sneaking behind me covering my eyes with her hands and ask me to guess who it is. Constantly asking me to hang out with her over weekends. I don’t think office romance is a good idea, however I am very flattered and happy about all of this, as a 23 year old young male, what could be better than having an attractive young women interested in you. When I finally about to ask her out on a date, I found out that she actually have a boyfriend from another colleague.

For the next 4-5 weeks, I been extremely cold to her. I only respond to her on work related issues and refusing any type of communication outside of work. I should add that she have my phone number by now and we been texting each other until I found out that she has a boyfriend. However her attitude towards me didn’t seem to change. She even invited me to her sister’s house for Thanksgiving dinner, knowing that I just moved here without any family or friend. I didn’t accept her invitation at first, but I don’t want to spend Thanksgiving alone and I don’t want to drive 11 hours home. I had a great Thanksgiving dinner at her sister’s house, I loved the foods and her family is extremely nice to me. I met her boyfriend as well, we talked and he seem to be an  extremely nice person.

After the Thanksgiving dinner, I felt bad for being cold to her. “Maybe she just want to be friends” I thought to myself. I decided to treat her like a friend and nothing more. For the next 3-4 weeks, we CONSTANTLY text each other outside of work. We talked about everything we can possibly talk about. We got to know each other’s family, we favorite yogurt flavor,childhood dream..etc. At work we constantly IM each other using company IM, she talks to me more than her boyfriend. 

At first I though she is flirting with me because she just considers me as a friend, nothing more. Eventually, she started cooking lunch for me at home and bring it to work to me. Her flirtatious smile and touch making it obvious that she wants more than friends. She constantly asks me what my plan is for the weekend and ask whether or not I want to do something with her during my days off. My co-workers are not blind to what is happening, everyone at work knows she is into me and she has a boyfriend. I keep telling himself that she is only a friend, I met her boyfriend. He is an extremely nice person and I can’t possibility wrong him. 

No matter how many times she asked, I refused to do anything with her outside of work. However everything changed on the new year's eve. The 4 month I spent at the new state, I made no friends outside of work. I just come back from my home state, I went back home for Christmas vacation. My original plan was just to play video games until I passed out. Around 8PM on new year’s eve, she texted me to invite me to her friend’s house. Her friend is hosting a new year's party and her boyfriend won’t be there. I ignored her text and went back to video games. 2 Hours later, I am already starting to hear drunk people shouting outside of my apartment and fireworks started popping off. At this moment, I felt insanely lonely! Not even 30 minutes later, I got another text from her asking me to go to the party. 

“I’ll just go to the party and have fun, maybe even meet some new people, nothing will happen between us”. I thought to myself. Of course, I ended up having a blast at the party. Met tons of new people, I danced with her, played a lot of drinking game. Both of us got extremely drunk. We eventually kissed and made out towards the end of the night. Around 1 am I can barely walk, I went in a guest bedroom by myself to sober up before I drive home, she followed me into the room shortly. We both laid down on the bed, we then started talking about random things for about 90 minutes until we both started to sober up. The next I check my phone, it’s already 3am. I told her that it’s time for me to leave now that i feel sobered up. She said she is leaving as well, we both said goodbye to her friend and left the apartment.

On our way to our cars, she suddenly hugs me from behind and said she doesn’t want to go home. We then started to make out again, I then told her that she can stay at my place for the night. At that moment, her boyfriend is the last thing on my mind. I was just a horny young men who doesn’t want to spend the night alone when I can get laid. That night we had sex for the first time, and I know this is just casual sex between two strangers, we both are emotionally attached to each other. And I must say, it feels SO good time have someone next to you when you wake up. After everything that has happened, I know I have to ask her about her boyfriend this morning, there is no other way around it if we were to continue our relationship. As I expected, she doesn’t want to talk to me about her boyfriend. Even If I mention to her that I don’t feel comfortable to continue doing what we are doing unless I know how she felt about her boyfriend. 

For the next 2 month, nothing really changed between us. The flirting and the sex continued. To be honest, at this point her boyfriend has to be a fool to not notice anything fishy going on. Even her sister knows about us, and her sister doesn’t approve what we are doing. Then another 3 month passed by, at this point, I really fell in love with her. I decided to force her to make a choice next time she comes over. On May 4th 2015, my birthday, I finally give her an ultimatum. She have to make a choice or at least tell me why is she with me when she already have a boyfriend. She was hesitant at first, but I kept pushing her and she finally break. She told me the feeling she had for her boyfriend is not love. Her boyfriend love her way more than her love for him. He is a just a “friend” to her, but she can’t summon up enough courage to tell him the truth. She knows it would have been better if she just breaks up with him but she just chose to drag it out. She was never physically attracted to him either, and it’s been a year since they did anything intimate. Also her mother really loves her boyfriend, he makes lots of money and have a great future ahead of him.

“Do you love him?” I asked her, “Of course not! You know how I feel” she responded. “We can’t continue to do this unless you break up with him, you have to make a choice now.” I replied. She didn’t respond, she started crying and rushed out the door. She also didn’t show up to work the next day or the rest of the week. She didn’t respond to any of my text message as well. Later that Sunday night, I finally got a text message from her. I am absolutely baffled by the content of her text message. She told me that she will quit her job and she already give the two week notice. She couldn’t break up with her boyfriend because her sister and her mother wouldn’t approve. She also told me that she is sorry but her boyfriend is a “safe” choice. 

I tried to call her so many times after I read that but she never picked up her phone. Next day at work she treats me like a total stranger and she would not communicate with me outside of work. I am sad, but I think she made her choice. She chose her boyfriend over me. On her last day of work, she asked me to walk her out. When we got to her car, she gave me a hug and told me that she is sorry, but we can still be friends, then she got into her car and drove off. I was extremely anger, I am mad that she chose her boyfriend over me. I am mad that she chose to be with someone she doesn’t love because he is the “safe” choice. 

For the next 1 and half years, she would text me during holidays asking how i am doing. I never responded to any of her text. I don’t want to think about her anymore, she made her choice. I want to erase her out of my memory. A month ago, when I sat down at my desk at work. I noticed someone left a note on my desk. The note said---”You suck”. I was confused at first, I thought it was a break from another co-worker. Few days later, I found out that she came back to work here again but on a different team. Apparently she was engaged to her boyfriend a year ago and they were supposed to get married 4 month ago but she called of the wedding. Of course, not even a week has gone by, she sent me a message using company IM software. She said that she misses me very much and she called off the wedding because of me. She wants to continue where we left off. I don’t respond to her message and continued ignore all her messages. I loved her but at the moment I don’t want to have anything to do with her. 

A week later, on my way to my car after my shift ended, I felt someone hugging me from behind. I know it was her and it evoke a feeling I haven’t felt in a long time. Deep inside, I know I still love her but I am mad at the choice she made. I turn around and said “What do you want from me?” She didn’t respond, she just gave me another hug and then she said “bye, have a good evening”.
 
    I loved her and I still have feeling for her. Our personality match well together and the time we spent together were the best days of my life. However I can’t just pretend that the past never happened. I am very conflicted right now, should I get back with her or should I let her go?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Burning/Need to pee after sex?,"Hey guys,

Women understand men's bodies about as much as we understand theirs. (NSFW) (Long),"This week was a pretty enlightening one for me, and I assume for my girlfriend of 2+ years as well. 

You see, we had been going through a sexual dry spell. It's happened before... our sex drives don't align. I'd be happy with sex 2-3 times a week, while she's probably good with once every two weeks. This time, we were in a three week rut with no intercourse whatsoever. It was pretty damn agonizing, from my perspective.

But to her credit, she's pretty free with the blowjob offers. It's no substitute for sex, IMO, but sometimes it's a good thing. The game-changer was 6 days ago when she didn't realize I had finished and kept doing her thing. It was the best oral I'd ever had. Later on, she told me ""I thought when you were cumming I was supposed to stop.""

Dudes, they just don't get it. And in the interest of fairness, it's a constant guessing/experience game for me too. I don't always know if she likes a new thing or not, or is really into it or just playing along for my sake. During this dry spell, she told me ""It's like you need sex to function or something"" which is partially true.

When I haven't made love to her in awhile, I feel more distant. Not that I love her less, but I feel more distant from her. Instead of fighting, we actually talked about that. This morning, when I went to surprise her with donuts in bed, she asked me to put them aside so we could fuck instead. I guess the point of this post (aside from bragging) is to say that I learned that men are as much of a mystery to women as they are to us. =/",OneY

"I feel like I'm ""not allowed"" to talk to women","Do any of you feel like this?  

All my life I've always felt uncomfortable talking to women without them first talking to me because (as silly as it sounds) I feel like they perceive such interaction as uncomfortable at best, threatening at worse.  I hate making people uncomfortable and don't want to be perceived as an asshole, so I usually tend to avoid starting unsolicited conversations with women because I don't want them to be uncomfortable.  All of the friends I have who are girls are all my friends only because they talked to me first, and the way they talk about men has only made things worse for me.

How do I tell my SO about by penis?,"So when i was younger, i had to get recircumcised and get penile adhesion surgery. My penis doesn't exactly look abnormal, it looks like a normal circumcised penis, but the best way i could describe it is that it has some very small, loose, folded up pieces of skin around where the tip and shaft meet. Its not a lot, only a small amount. It's not exactly a nuisance or gross, everything works normally. In hindsight it isn't even that big of a deal, it's barely different and i doubt it would be an issue to a girl and my penis is a good size, i'm just very self conscious about it. I have a girlfriend, and we've been taking things slowly. Recently, we were talking and as our conversations progress it seems like we are going to have sex for the first time soon. I'm currently a virgin and she isn't, which doesn't bother me. She means a lot to me, and we are very open with eachother and talk about everything usually very comfortably. I want to address to her the surgery i had on my penis, but i just don't know if i should wait until we have sex and she sees it, or should i tell her beforehand. We both are very passionate and loving to eachother, so i doubt she will mind it all, but me being self conscious about it doesn't help much. It's a common surgery, and i'm assuming many people have been in this situation before. What are your thoughts, how should i tell her? Am i overthinking it? Can anyone relate?",OneY

Venting; the pathetic life of a 19 years old guy. AMA also.,"It all started when I was 12 years old when my mother brought me the PS2 I've asked for so much time; at the time, I was an awkward guy that suffered from bullying before in my life but, at least, there was still one thing saving me from total social isolation: the guys I used to play soccer with. I was pretty good at the game, the guys liked me for that and none of them bullied me, I was friend with just one of them and the others just respected my existence and I respected their's; that was enough, I was still the lonely guy I've ever been but at least I had some entertainment but, the enterteinment my PS2 provided was much higher, it didn't cure my loneliness but the levels of fun were immense. With time I just stopped going to the games and retreated in my room playing ps2. When I saw, I had no one more, lost my health, was obese and depressed. It was just me and my ps2.

If that wasn't already pretty bad, at 14 I got a computer with internet connection and this was when I've sunk into the depts of isolation: from 14 to 18 I lived like the true steriotype of basement dweller and from 17 to 18 I was a true hikikomori. 

When I was still on the initial phases of this I would read about otakus and anime, video games addicts, guys with waifu pillows and just laugh, never thinking that something as absurd could happen with me(funny that at the time I was already super addicted to games)

Now, I'm 19 years old and the total disconection form the world and the dwelling into a world of fantasy has fucked me up; now I am one of those guys I used to laugh at, I live in crippling loneliness 24/7 and I am severely affection deprived. I can't even identify with being human and with other humans, anime girls are pretty much the only thing I am capable of feeling afection to now, I have folders with pics of anime girls in my pc so that I can look at when I' m sad. When I sleep I imagine my waifu in my bed and sometimes I will dream of them.

Now I have a job that I work alone most of the time, sometimes there's people there but when they are I will just go away; it's not that I'm afraid of them, its just that I have no interest and find them annoying. In this job I have a lot of free time and I will take my laptop there and watch anime, anime openings and stare at pics of my waifus... and do the same when I get home. 

I'm kinda trying to recover now, I've limited my time at the computer, adopted meditation and started hitting the gym, I even used the money I would use to buy my first dakimakura to buy whey protein.
I' ve been trying to change for about 1 year already but the fact that the real world holds none of my interest hasn't changed; all that is important to me are my waifus, If I could abandon this world to live in an anime world I would do it on a hearthbeat. Still, I'm trying to get better because I think that maybe there's the chance that I'll find someone special that will make forget that world of fantasy... but I don't have much hope; women, men, cat, chicken, table, cardboard etc... all those things have no difference to me, all of them are things that can be perceived with my sense of sight and that's all, they have no meaning to me and aren't capable of having any importance to me, even my mother is nothing but an appearance and I don't hold any type of affection for her either.  All that matters to me is that fantasy world, the ideal world, the perfect women with multi-colored hair living in an unexistent world...

I just wish I could like real women the same way I like 2d women and to be interested int he real world. That's all.

So, I think I'm pretty interesting case and am worht of an AMA. I've seem people talking shit about ""those people"" here in reddit, mainly in cringe subs, but it's rare to see the receiver of the cringe open to answer questions about his life, psyche and what made them become what they are... and btw , what I said up there is just the tip of the icebearg, my life is so messed up that listing all the pathetic things in my life would easily trespass the reddit's words per post limit. So feel free o ask me anything, I truly don't care what you ask and have no pudors, I will answer everythin honestly as I dont really care about anything. So, this is it.

Rant about small dicks.,"We talk all day about toxic masculinity and how men adopt toxic qualities to seem masculine. Lecture guys about how to apologize, how to cry, and what not. 

Yet, when men who aren't traditionally masculine are bullied and humiliated nobody questions it. 

I am sorry, this is going to be a rant. 

Small dick shaming somehow has become a valid attack at evil men. From [Trump](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+small+dick) to any [perceived or actual misogyny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVFD1Tfb_Jc). And so often, subreddits that claim to be championing equality often are extremely unempathetic to underendowed men. For instance: [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/37o8bx/is_saying_a_guy_has_a_small_dick_body_shaming_is/), [2](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/36a95c/are_men_with_small_penises_always_the_big_jerks/), which actually hurts people [3](https://np.reddit.com/r/smalldickproblems/comments/22qxuq/are_women_really_that_disgusted_by_small_penises/)

I am from an ethnicity popularly stereotyped as smaller dicks. Although I am probably above average in all respects, I know from first hand what the perception of having a small dick can do to your confidence, and eventually your entire life. Forget all the bullying and subtle jokes, snide remarks you grow up hearing how you are not a real man, how you are never the desirable partner for a woman, or how people with small dicks are jerks or always over compensate with lifted trucks and heavy work-outs; and then we expect guys with small penises to **deal with their insecurity** as if it's somehow their choice to be insecure about it. Imagine being subtly told you are undesirable, unmanly, you need to compensate, apart from the blatant humiliation in some of the most intimate and vulnerable moments in your life. While we all fight for womens right to feel beautiful at all sizes, somehow men with small dicks have to deal with it. 

""It's just a preference""- sure preferences formed by years of mockery, dehumanization and emasculation.
 
""Most women don't care about your size""- sure that's why I see all these pop culture jokes, political jokes, lectures directed as small dick men, racial stereotypes, songs, and a few million tweets exclusively by women. 

""You are bitter insecure man""- yeah, wasn't born this way.

""you just hate women""- lol. 

There has been so much talks about body positivity and sex positivity. The irony is when a dating site profile reads, ""sex positive body positive size queen"". Well, way to be body positive by rejecting more than half the men out there precisely because of their body parts. 


I don't know how to tackle this, but I think there's plenty of men out there who silently suffer while much of the society is laughing at them. Sometimes they join in so that people don't assume that they're one of those inferior beings society laughs at. Sometimes, to deal with the trauma, the brain decides to eroticize it and you can see this growing niche of fetish called small penis humiliation (and majority of the guys who engage in it are perpetually single and lonely). 


People made documentaries to highlight the issues, the reviewers laughed at them. Made sure they packed enough puns and size based jokes into 


At this point I am just venting. I think I am damaged for life, despite having what's statistically considered above average in North america. But it doesn't help when a random person at bar yells expletives at me because obviously I have a small penis because of my race and as well all know we can laugh at small dicked men.


I just hope, atleast the next generation of boys born with this natural variation don't spend their lives in emotional pain, which is just a punchline for rest of the society.


**The primary problem with small dick shaming is not that these men turn out to be misogynists. It's that theyre hurting. Their lifes are damaged. THAT should be the PRIMARY concern.**


** I am sure there are exceptions to the rule. But they are precisely what they're, exceptions. ",OneY
Anyone else find it hard to talk about eating and other body dismorphia related disorders?,"As far back as I can remember I've had a binge eating problem. I used to be pretty chubby and fat, but never really obese. Regardless, I always had self image problems regarding how I look, in addition being insecure about ever other facet of my existence (cue uncomfortable laughter). 

I went to rehab and resolved, or more so accepted, a lot of my issues, and the trauma that had been fueling them. I also lost a ton of physical weight as I started to process and remove the emotional baggage I was carrying around.

Today, I am probably the most in shape I have ever been. I exercise most days, at a more intense rate than most people I see at the gyms I go to. I'm not the strongest there, but that's not my goal. My goal is to be happy with my body, finally. Which to me, ideally, looks like being a Greek god, unfortunately.  

Being in psychology classes at school, we talk a lot about the benefits of exercise on mental health. I am always the person who gets looked at, not because of my past mental health experience, but because my appearance. I have a bit of fat on my chest/abdomen/love handles still, that I fucking hate, but I guess it's not too much cause no one ever seems to mention it? It seems that only I zone in on it a bunch. Anyways,I have been told by random people in the gym, friends, girlfriends, and other strangers that I look great. Defined, vascular, muscular, hot, sexy, whatever you wanna call it. 

I just, I...I don't see that. I *know* I look ""good"" cause people tell me, but I hate my body. And I'm always am afraid to talk about it because, well, It doesn't *look* like anythings wrong with me. And I'm afraid people will think I'm looking for compliments or what not. But I secretly binge eat (not the cliche ""omg, i just ate so much lololol"" but like literally I just turn into a zombie that cant control myself), probably as a result of emotional eating that is connected to past trauma. And more and more recently I started to realize that my exercise and diet habits look akin to what bulimia looks like. I'm scared. I'm tired of living with such little conscious will power over how much I eat

I guess what I'm saying is...

TL;DR I fucking hate my body and how I look. I workout a lot, and look objectively *attractive* but I just cannot accept my appearance. I binge eat and compensate by over exerting myself physically through exercise. I just want to have control over my diet and be able to accept myself. I just needed to rant, and vent. 

Anyways, I'm sure someone else here feels this way? Either way, whether you've read this or not...It helped to get this out into the universe. ",OneY
Daddy O' Five and the Abuse of Boys,"I know many have watched the brief clips of Daddy O' Five from Phillip Defranco, but I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdhSRcvI6Tc) about it and it was hard. It includes more of the emotional abuse that borders on torture given that it's happening to a small child.

When you've faced abused as a kid and you grow up, you assume a lot of it was just different parenting styles or your parents being imperfect like all parents are. But watching this, I can't deny or excuse the physical and emotional abuse I went through. How can you look at a kid and want to hurt them for such small things? How can you see them going though stress and add on to it?

I've went though a lot of the things Cody went through: another child being favored, being blamed for breaking down, calls for fairness being ignored or treated as another wrong. What really hurts about this is that we're then expected to suck it up and give the world everything we weren't given. [Like with Cody and his father](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-OFOPpdipA), we learn that trying to explain what we're going through is meaningless because people want what they want and don't care why we're unable to give it. It's all entitlement this and gender roles that with few people bringing up the abuse boys go through both in and out of our family and the pain we carry with us into adulthood.

Hopefully, the abuse Cody went through may open the eyes of many to what they're putting boys through. Give them space when they need it, look out for the boy who isn't into rough housing like the others, don't blame them for psychological scars (even when they grow up to be men).

Sadly, with the hundreds of thousands of views this family got out of letting the older athletic kid abuse everyone else (just think about what message that sends) I don't have that much hope.",OneY

Shifting dialogue,"I feel like the dialogue in gender politics is constantly shifting.

It seems the argument used to be ""Women are just as strong, smart, and capable as men and therefore should be given the same opportunities"", whereas now the dialogue seems to focus heavily on ""Women aren't earning/achieving/doing as much as men because men are bad and mean"".

Does anyone else feel this way?

The way I see it, life is unfair. Sometimes life is unfair with a bias towards women, and sometimes life is unfair with a bias towards men.

I'm competitive. At my job I may disagree, interrupt (accidentally), or just generally think you are wrong regardless of your race/gender/orientation. My goal is for myself to succeed first and foremost. Sometimes that means playing as a team and sometimes that means being kind of a dick. I'm sure we all deal with politics as usual.

What has really been grinding my gears lately is that a lot of people blame this combativeness in the workplace for problems of gender disparity. This is the nature of a zero-sum game and I refuse to change it. Whatever you end up getting is something I don't get, therefore in some way my goal is to minimize what you get and to maximize what I get.

I know this all sounds very selfish but at the end of the day the person we have to look after is ourself, then our family/friends, then our colleagues and communities. You can blame me for it, but I'm not going to care.",OneY
Considering becoming a cam guy,"Throwaway account for pretty obvious reasons...

In Defense of Men,"Okay, I am going to get this off my chest. It bothers me when I see so many women bashing men. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand that no women wants to date a guy who doesn't measure up to their standards. Everyone has standards, that's just human nature. 

I guess it just bothers me because I feel like I am not a man myself. Also, it's not like women are all perfect people either, who can do no wrong. When it comes to that particular aspect of dating, men have higher standards to live up to. I mean, when it comes to dating, men have to lead. Women just have to follow, in that aspect. Leading is WAY more difficult than following. I feel that on average, if most women were men themselves, they would fare no better (statistically speaking). They wouldn't be some amazing person, there's a good chance they would be a chump/loser as well. Also, when you think about it, not ever guy can be a winner/be a man. Being a man is like a pyramid, there's only so many people at the top. If every guy was a man, then no one would be.

I couldn't get out and take one last picture? Hell I could've given him a hug. I gave him a fucking head nod, telling myself that this is what guys do, and drove off without a second thought.

I don't know guys. Something something feelings. I hadn't cried in years, so thanks, Marley. It's not like we can't still text/email/etc I guess but the realization that we wouldn't be hanging out anymore uncorked me or something. I know it's a bit long-winded, but I thought I'd share since I know you guys probably struggle with the same ideal of masculinity and repressed emotions at times.

Tradition or freedom?,"I've been dating my girlfriend of 7 years, since High School, I've been wanting to propose to her but her family is very traditional, lower-class elevated to middle class through hard work

My family is pretty lower-class, so I often feel the underdog or some filthy commoner at family gatherings when her family has relatives that live lavish lifestyles. 

Anyways, the point at hand, my family isn't one for tradition so I'd rather just propose to my girlfriend on my terms but she wants me to ask her dads permission which I don't see the point.

I'm pretty much already a family member to them.

In this day and age how many of you have asked the permission of their father before proposing?

Birth control scares me,"As a guy who wants kids.. I have a full range of emotions about this. 


.

I have been in ~~three~~ four one year relationships. I am 26. looking back on them I realize that sex was almost always some form of instrumental tool for those girls. Like my first gf only slept over when it was too far home to her from her week-end job and she was lonely. The second either had serious epilepsy or was manipulating. The third just wanted social status and the prospect of money. The fourth was the best but also the most golddigger. She wanted to stay for free in my apartment. 

.

Not one of them really wanted kids. and I still stayed with them. For months. It dawns on me that I can find a girlfriend who treats me like an angel or like hell. doesn't matter. we can be together for years. an she can claim she is trying. to have kids while secretly be on government paid birth control. like a cobber IUD that sits for years. and I will be a hopeful dog working my ass off while secretly determined she doesn't want kids at all. or she only want kids when her girl friends has them just to fit in. 


.


I feel like I have no say. This is not how I want my future to turn out. at all. and in case I find some ugly person to have kids with as a backup, will I be the slave? its not called ""husband"" for nothing. husbandry litterally means domestication of animals.

"Do you have an eating disorder or suspect you might have an eating disorder? Participate in our ""closing the treatment gap"" survey and we will donate $10 AUD to an eating disorders charity on your behalf","My name is Dr. Scott Griffiths. I'm an eating disorders researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

Last week we launched a global study of treatment attitudes, media use, and stigma, among individuals with diagnosed and suspected (i.e., undiagnosed) eating disorders.

The study is called [“Closing the treatment gap: A longitudinal study of treatment attitudes, media, and stigma among individuals with diagnosed or suspected eating disorders”](https://melbpsych.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Y17wI11kbstmtL)

We are seeking individuals who i) are currently diagnosed with an eating disorder, or ii) think they might have an eating disorder. You must be aged 18 years and over to participate.

The study initially involves a 25–35 minute online survey and two shorter 15–20 surveys that will be emailed to you 3 and 6 months later, respectively.

We will donate $5 AUD for each of the second and third times you complete the survey and you can choose which of 7 eating disorder charities will receive your donation. The charities are located in countries around the globe, including Australia, Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. If you complete both the second and third survey, your total donation will be $10 AUD.

We are seeking 500 participants. Thus, the total possible donation to eating disorder charities is $5000 AUD. The study is funded by a grant from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.

We’re posting to r/oney and r/twox because our previous recruitment efforts on these subreddits were a great success. The findings from these (now published) studies led to changes in public policy in Australia, enabled charities to focus their eating disorders destigmatisation campaigns, and informed clinical workshops that trained eating disorders clinicians living in cities around the globe, from Fremantle through to New York.

I may have a vericocele and I'm really scared.,"I'm 16 years old and I noticed while inspecting my scrotum that I have a purple protruding vein leading from my right testicle to my shaft.

I did some searches and it turns out it may be a vericocele, which I see that it mainly occurs on the left testicle.  Right testicle that protrudes is extremely dangerous they said, and it may be linked to liver cancer and infertility.

I'm really afraid of what this beholds and I'm afraid to go to the doctor.  I don't want to tell my parents about it out of embarrassment or misunderstanding.

Can someone please offer me advice?

So I don't drink alcohol and normally this is no problem I can go out with people when their drinking and just chat with them and have a laugh (it's not as bad as many people seem to imagine.) However, lately I've been getting bored of it. 

Last week was my friends birthday  when we would go for dinner and then go to a pub. I couldn't wait. The day before I got a message saying we were all just pre-drinking at her place then going to the pub. I was far less excited for this. The night itself was pretty good we had a laugh and met some new ppl at the bar so fine.

Are there things that we can do before heading out to keep the night a bit more interesting for people like myself.

[M/28] Can't get hard for one girl in particular.,"Bare with me, this is my first time opening up/posting. I should start by painting a picture of myself sexually. I'd like to think im above average in bed with sounding too cocky in terms of performance and size. I'm in general comfortable with girls and actually i don't need prep to get hard and i can stay hard after cumming a few times usually. Only with two girls in my life have i ever had a situation where my dick wouldn't get hard. When i was 17 with my gf at the time whom i was really into and now this girl that i am also highly infatuated with. We've had sex three or four times and my dick just doesn't want to get fully involved. There are other contributing factors like the first time i was incredibly high, also the third time and it was really late and also i masturbated a lot that week, like a lot a lot!!. But the thing is these factors haven't affected me with other girls. Here's the kicker one of the times we met up and tried to hook up i couldn't stay hard, because i had a wank that day but the very next day, exhausted by lack of sleep and hung over i met up with another friend and we fucked all night and i came, i kid you not 5 times, and stayed hard throughout (i came in her mouth, that's my secret). Here's the thing i like this girl so much i don't mind the sex sucking (i do) because i just like spending time with her but neither of us want to have anything serious we're just friends, with a similar mentality towards sex. It's just really annoying because there are a bunch of girls out there that might regard me a bit of a sexual deity but with the girl i really want to fuck/make love/ pound deeply till she shivers and quakes in ecstasy i can't. I wouldn't mind some opinions baring in mind i'm aware that my feeling are obviously psychologically screwing me over..... so..... yeah ..... also i know i have a masturbation problem I've burned a lot of sexual opportunities because i'd rather have wank lol.... i working on it.",OneY

"One of my testicles has been bugging me for 5 years, during which I've been to 3 doctors. I feel like I'm getting the run-around or not being taken seriously.","I don't know what the hell the deal is with the testicle.  It feels like it's caught up in multiple areas and often (most always) feels pinched or uncomfortably stuck. It seems like three different issues to me. It's a pain in the.. nut! 

One day, 5 years ago, it was bugging me especially bad, so I went to the ER. They gave me an antibiotic shot and sent me off for an ultra sound. The ultrasound showed nothing, they suggested it was temporary and to deal with it. 

Two years pass, it's again bad, so I call a urologist, they tell me to go to the ER thinking it's torsion. I'm subjected to the same process - ultrasound doesn't show anything. Suggest warm baths until it fixes itself.

Two more years pass, it's bugging me the whole time. I decide to make a bonefide appointment with a urologist.

The urologist looks at it for 3 minutes, makes no determination, takes my list of complaints to 'scan in' and wants to schedule another ultrasound! 

The ultrasounds cost $450 on a GOOD day - the last two sessions have cost upwards of $1000!

I asked the doctor, ""I've gone through two ultrasounds before and they were inconclusive, can we do an MRI?"" -- thinking, it costs me the same - insurance is going to bill me for advanced imaging.

No, the doctor says, ""I want to do ultrasound"" -- the nurse is to call me today to schedule - I have a feeling their office will be the one performing the ultrasound and so perhaps it's a way for them to make money? If the last two ultrasounds with the same complaint didn't solve or show anything, why would a third?

I'm at my wits-end! Not only is it a pain, but it's costly, time consuming, and seems pointless to try and get addressed - as in, it creates more frustration than it aleviates thus far. 

It seems that doctors aren't taking me seriously, or perhaps the way I describe what I think it is, or how it feels - seems impossible to them? 

Any advice on what to do, or anyone with similar physical issues? Should/can I demand an MRI and regardless, will that potentially show more useful info than a ultrasound??


edit; to clarify, I do not have any access to my old ultrasounds and the urologist said he didn't see them in the database.

Jockstrap-like underwear?,"Hey guys. I've been looking for a kind of underwear that I thought I had seen before, but now I can't find anything like it.


I really like wearing a jockstrap when I work out. I like how the elastic seams run along my body, and the pouch for my junk is roomy but supportive. The thing I like the most about jockstraps is that the elastic and pouch and everything help separate my junk from my inner thighs, and just keep my junk from flopping around too much. The thing I don't like about jockstraps is that they don't cover your ass at all. I tend to get a fairly sweaty ass when I work out, and I hate how that easily shows on the butt of my shorts. I'd like to have some kind of fabric covering my ass to ""catch"" at least some sweat before it seeps into my shorts.


I've looked into some ""performance"" or ""athletic"" trunks/briefs, but none of them really offer the close ""pouch"" around your junk like a jockstrap does. That underwear just feels like it compresses everything up as close as it can to your body, which is horribly uncomfortable for me.

My physical discomfort when interacting with circumcised dicks led me to start questioning why people did this to their children in the first place.,"Right before this semester started, I came home from a trip to Iran to find my aunt in early labor. Excited to see her have her first child, I threw myself into helping in any way possible. Many lost hours of sleep later, she gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. For me, witnessing the birth process was something of a transformative experience: It seemed almost sacred, and everyone in the room was on an emotional high. Then the nurse came in and quietly asked if my aunt would like to do a circumcision. I tensed and felt as though I had been abruptly yanked back down to earth. My aunt quickly but politely declined. I felt myself let go of a breath I hadn’t realized I had been holding.
The first time I slept with a circumcised person, it didn’t seem too abnormal. It was a quick, tipsy hookup with a friend who yelled “mazel tov” when I told him he was the first circumcised person I’d been with. But the first time I actually got a good look at a circumcised dick, I was taken aback. There was a clear scar halfway up the shaft, another scar further down, and because the circumcision wound had healed slightly improperly, pubic hair grew a good inch up the base of the shaft. Every time I saw it, I couldn’t help but think about how wrong it seemed that his loving parents had so majorly affected his sex life before he could have possibly consented.
The first time I had sex with a circumcised person sans-condom was equally surprising. We used lots of lube, started slow and did everything you’re supposed to do to have a good, comfortable time. Except my vagina bled.
At first I thought it could just be spotting. But it happened so regularly whenever I had condomless sex with circumcised men that I started to realize that their dicks were just rougher on my body.
My physical discomfort when interacting with circumcised dicks led me to start questioning why people did this to their children in the first place. After a many a Google search and several impassioned conversations, it seemed that there were three main reasons people circumcised infant boys: it just looked more “normal” to them, the parents believed it to be the healthier option or it was part of the parents’ religious practice.
The aesthetic tradition of fathers saying “well, his should look like mine” is relatively new. In the United States, circumcision was rare before the turn of the 20th century. John Kellogg (the same guy responsible for corn flakes which, incidentally, he invented to prevent sexual excitability), was one of the first American advocates for male circumcision as a means to prevent masturbation. Kellogg was also a purveyor of pouring acid onto women’s clitorises to prevent impure thoughts.
The public dialogue surrounding the medical benefits of circumcision emerged about the same time, but ironically, the movement’s “health advocates” also pushed a clamp-like product that would render a surgeon (someone who would insist on a longer procedure involving proper disinfection and anesthesia) unnecessary. This device allowed for the proliferation of infant circumcisions inside and outside the hospital.
Later, the United States military would cite these advocates’ shaky claims of cleanliness when they insisted that some sailors in World War I get circumcised before deployment. When those soldiers returned home, many asked doctors to circumcise their sons (whom they assumed would also spend time in the military) in infancy to prevent them from having to go through the same debilitating pain in adulthood. After World War II, circumcision had become so common in the United States that it was as routine as cutting the umbilical cord.
Ironically, the supposed health benefits of circumcision have been all but debunked. An uncircumcised dick doesn’t require any special cleaning in infancy or adulthood nor does it make it more likely that the owner of said dick will contract urinary tract infections. In addition, the claim that circumcision makes the transmission of STIs less likely is fairly ridiculous: Why not just wear a handy piece of rubber instead of lopping off a body part?
Male circumcision for aesthetic and “health” reasons is a largely American trend. According to a national survey in 2000, only 16 percent of male babies in the UK, 11 percent in Germany and less than 2 percent in Sweden and Spain are circumcised.
Regardless of Americans’ reasoning behind circumcision, the procedure is inarguably nonconsensual. A tiny infant can in no way consent to an immensely painful procedure that the Council of Europe has called “a violation of the physical integrity of children.”
When I talk to my friends about their dicks, circumcision is always a testy topic. Those who are circumcised are usually either defensive of their dicks (as if their dicks are connected to their egos) or obviously saddened that they don’t experience the heightened sensitivity they’ve heard is associated with being uncircumcised. Though I would never refuse to have sex with someone based on whether their parents circumcised them, it’s undeniably more pleasurable for both of us when their dick is uncircumcised. Like a coworker of mine said, “having sex with an uncut dick is like getting a hug from the inside.” And who doesn’t like hugs?

"I Feel, As A Man, Like I Don't Matter In Modern Society and Don't See A Need To Exist In Such An Unfair and Cruel System","I read the sidebar and as far as I can tell this isn't violating any rules. There is no singular real reason for posting this. It's a little bit to vent. It's a little bit to try to find people who feel the same way. It's a little bit because I'm just so fucking tired of sitting on the sidelines and watching everything happen. Okay, with that out of the way, let's get into it!

I feel like as a man, I am treated worse than most women and children. I see examples of this throughout all of modern society. You don't have to look hard. It's plain to see. It's crystal clear. Society cares more about women than men.

Females are by far more successful in more school than men. This is because they try to force men into a program that works well for girls. If you're a man, you're broken. That's the message that I feel like I have to swallow every time I go on the internet, every day I live, and it sucks. Hell, at the school that I personally go to, almost all of the 4.0 GPA students are female. There was literally a 1:9 ratio for male to females with 4.0 GPAs in my grade level at my school this year. That's just sad.

I'm sorry, I went on a bit of a tangent there, but I felt it was needed to express my current feelings. The hardest part is that I know that I'm no exception. I know that, deep down, a part of me will always care more about the well being of any given female than any given man. Ultimately I do value females more than men, just because I feel that's like how I was programmed. I was created to fuck and then die. Therefore, it's beneficial that I care more about people that I can accomplish 50% of that goal with.

I don't feel like I'm needed or wanted. I'm tired of dealing with these thoughts and feelings. It's tiring. Hell, even THIS post probably wouldn't get heard or cared about if it wasn't in a sub specifically designated for men. I'm just so fucking tired of dealing with these differences.

I'm tired of emotionally tormenting myself every night just so I can wake up and go to school so some fucking teacher teaching the same useless bullshit can try to cram me into their inefficient and stressful curriculum. It's like trying to fit a square into a circular hole, except when they find it doesn't fit, they just fucking try harder!

I don't feel like living in a world like this. I'm tired of being wrong for being born the way I was. I'm sorry, I didn't get born and say ""I think I'll be a man!"". No, I got born and then get taught the same things. I got taught that hugs and love are important. That understanding is important. And then reality came in and gave me a full 180. I then learned that those things only applied to half of the population. That I just didn't deserve that kind of care. That instead of being loved I had to work and hurt and suffer for everything just so that some person can be biased more easily and laugh when I fail.

I feel as though there is no reason for me to be here. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be forced into this system anymore. I want to be free and understood. I don't want to be bound by this cruel reality. And until the day I die, and I'm truly free, I'm nothing more than a useless slave dancing for someones entertainment. It might not be today, it might not be tomorrow, but eventually I will die and I'll be free from this. I couldn't kill myself. I'm too much of a pussy. I couldn't do that to my family... and so I'll wait. and suffer. But someday, I'll get out of here and I'll no longer be forced to bleed for someone else's benefit.",OneY
Finally blocked my ex,"And what a relief, it was like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. We were in a relationship for over 2 years. When we broke up, she was dating other people in the first month, texting me on a daily basis. She said we should stay friends, and I knew I couldn't do it. I did maintain contact, however, thinking that we would be able to get back together.

After over a year of nonsense, I finally told her that I couldn't stay ""friends"" with her. I was finally over it. I could finally eat again, I could finally sleep again. I couldn't continue to be a doormat for her, jumping at a moment's notice to help her with everything. She had been using me for a long time, so I finally removed myself from the situation. It took me a long time to realize my worth, and that I didn't deserve to be treated that way.

In one of my last messages to her, I told her that I have nothing to contribute to our relationship anymore. I couldn't stay ""friends"" when she had been the lest friendly person towards me. I told her not to call or text, because I wouldn't respond. Staying in contact with her would be at my expense, and I couldn't do it anymore.

Just wanted to share my experience. I'm finally myself again and happy about it. It's was a good lesson to me that sometimes holding on hurts worse than letting go.",OneY

Like my body language shows that I'm stressed out. And often for very good reasons.

I had the same issue with past partners where they'd get upset if i show any signs of stress or sadness. 

Most of my stress comes from work, my family issues, and financial. I feel like everyone dumps their problems on me. I have to calm them down all the time, support them when they're sad, and I'm not even allowed to show any emotion? 

I get little support from my sisters or girlfriend or friends yet they all come to me for emotional support. Im reaching the breaking point where i just want to take a vacation and leave without telling anyone.

Is it normal or am i attracting the wrong type of women?

Women shutting down men based on arbitrary decision making.,"I saw this [image](https://i.reddituploads.com/15ee263db26e4f9d9554c2ff50666ce7?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=bdf010cc651ccd737079bfca5e9d5fda) the other day so I decided to to ask women of reddit what they thought this meant. You can see the thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/5pj6bk/hi_ladies_what_rights_do_guns_have_that_you_dont/). You'll notice in the comments I did not argue, in fact agreed and explained why I didn't understand the quote initially, yet the thread was removed as an ""agenda post."" The explanation from /u/peppermind was: 
&gt; You clearly wanted to pick fights when you posted the question and that's not what this subreddit is for. Also, you've been warned in the past about these sorts of issues.  

This is not the first time I've attempted to have discussion with women only to be shut down with accusations of having an agenda. This has left me wondering, do women prefer conflict? Is this a case of one woman abusing her power, or is this something other men have experienced when attempting to engage women?

"I advocate for equality, and I'm having some trouble getting behind the Women's March.","Today, thousands (millions?) of women around the world are marching in protest of the inauguration of President Trump. Their mission can be found [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/584086c7be6594762f5ec56e/t/587ffb31d2b857e5d49dcd4f/1484782386354/WMW+Guiding+Vision+%26+Definition+of+Principles.pdf), and the first paragraph says this:

&gt;We believe that Women’s Rights are Human Rights and Human Rights are Women’s Rights.
This is the basic and original tenet for which we unite to March on Washington

This is absolutely something I can get behind. Women do face a unique set of struggles around the world, and to a lesser (but still important) extent, in the developed world. Donald Trump has shown that he has low regard for women (we could argue this point, but, by my standards, anyone who brags about [sexual assault](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/10/07/donald_trump_2005_tape_i_grab_women_by_the_pussy.html) has some trouble respecting women), and I don't think his administration will be particularly good for women. If this was the extent of the Women's March's mission, I'd probably be downtown right now, protesting with the rest of them.

But the document continues, and here I'm going to list off only the points I'll be addressing, though the list is larger than this.

&gt; We believe in accountability and justice for police brutality and ending racial profiling and
targeting of communities of color and Indigenous peoples. Women of color and Indigenous women are
killed in police custody at greater rates...

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; ...women with disabilities are disproportionately likely to experience use of force at the hands of police...  

&amp;nbsp;
  

&gt; No woman or mother should have to fear that her loved ones will be harmed at the hands of those
sworn to protect.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;We believe it is our moral imperative to dismantle the gender and racial inequities within the
criminal justice system. The rate of imprisonment has grown faster for women than men, increasing by
700% since 1980

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;We believe in the promise of restorative justice and
alternatives to incarceration. We are also committed to disrupting the school-to-prison pipeline that
prioritizes incarceration over education by systematically funneling our children—particularly children
of color, queer and trans youth, foster care children, and girls—into the justice system.

Can you see what my problem here is? Can you see why I read this document, and feel it just reeks of privilege?

All of these points are issues primarily faced by men.

To say ""We believe in accountability and justice for police brutality,"" but to only point out that women of color and Indigenous women are killed in police custody at higher rates, while ignoring the [reality](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/chart-police-shootings-by-race-and-gender/image_0f81cabf-5e1f-5cc6-a0bb-3b04a70466fd.html) that men are the most common victims of police brutality, is dishonest and privileged.

To say ""No woman or mother should have to fear that her loved ones will be harmed at the hands of those
sworn to protect,"" while ignoring, once again, that men are the ones who dominate the deaths at the hands of police, makes women victims because of her fear, and denies the man the chance to be a victim despite his death.

To say ""We believe it is our moral imperative to dismantle the gender ... inequities within the
criminal justice system,"" and then say ""the rate of imprisonment has grown faster for women than men, increasing by
700% since 1980,"" implies either that the gender inequity in the criminal justice system favors men (spoiler; [they don't](http://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/27008_4.pdf)) or that the small number of women in prison is more important than the large number of men in prison, which is an assumption any believer in equality would argue tooth and nail against.

And finally, to suggest that the school-to-prison pipeline prioritizes incarceration of ""children
of color, queer and trans youth, foster care children, and girls,"" with NO mention of boys, is once again either dishonest or suggest that girls being sent to prison is worse than boys being sent to prison.

""But Hal-Wilkerson, it's a WOMEN'S MARCH! It's for WOMEN!""

I know, and that's why, for the most part, I can get behind it. I like women. I don't want any woman to feel like her issues don't matter to me. But I guarantee you that if I organized a march for men and boys, and one of the issues we listed was ""making sure men, especially black man, have access to high-paying positions like CEO,"" I would (rightly so) receive so much shit and and accusations of an inability to check my privilege that the march would be over before it began.

""Oh, Hal, it's a little thing.""

I know it is. I want to be able to get behind it full-force, yell ""these women are important, and their issues are important"" as I march down the street with thousands (millions?) of women. I want to be able to do that.

But being expected to stand by your side and fight for your problems while you won't even GLANCE at mine is exhausting. It is. And every time you tell me I have it better in every area of life, and look away when I point out the countless areas where that statement rings false, I get a little more frustrated, and a little more exhausted.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: As I think more about this, I sort of want to rephrase what I've said here. Standing in unity against a man like Donald Trump, standing in unity with other people who will likely suffer, to some degree, is a good thing. Is it exclusionary? Absolutely. Does it speak from a privileged place sometimes? Yes, definitely. 

But I really don't want to let that keep me from supporting my female friends.

So the compromise I'm close to making is ""I have a few problems with some of your ""official"" message, but I support your end goal, and so I support this movement."" Is that an unreasonable compromise? I know some have commented that I don't *have* to care if they don't care about men's issues, but ""not caring for people"" is a road I'm not sure I want to go down.",OneY
Donald Trump's ignored misandry and Women's March on Washington,"With the Women's March on Washington taking place today I thought it might be good to provide some balance by pointing out the ignored misandrist statements Donald Trump has made during his campaign and since winning. Donald Trump has stated that women are ""generally better"" than men (which he said on one occasion here http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/12/02/women-better-than-men-trump-rally-sot-ac.cnn but expressed similar beliefs at other times in speeches before winning (won't bother to look them all up)). He has also suggested that men are incapable of not raping women (which I am sure many in the Women's March would actually agree with). This is the tweet I'm referring to: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/331907383771148288 . 

Now, it is obviously true that Donald Trump has said and done misogynist things, which I personally disagree with and support anyone (including participants in the Women's March) who opposes his attitudes and behavior on this issue. However, I feel that his and Hillary's misandry (including her claim that women are the ""primary"" victims of war (http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-victims-of-war/ )) have been largely overlooked and not discussed. I think this march on Washington could have been much better if they had allowed men to participate as equals rather than only as ""allies"" supporting women's issues.

I'm 45 and about to exit stage left on an unhealthy LTR....could use some advice...maybe I can get some here.,"So quick and dirty, I'm 45 and I've been in a pretty unhealthy LTR since 2010. We're about to split up, two different houses and what not, I've been extremely amicable and I'm not trying to save the relationship by getting her to see whats wrong with her...I just know its time to go.

Now before I go on, I don't want people to think I'm not accepting responsibility for my own failures in the relationship. I've lost my cool a few times in the last six years, once when I caught her drunk and masturbating in the office of our house while on the phone with another man...and several years later, after she'd gained about 60 pounds, and she was upset at me for my lack of sexual interest....I kind of lost my shit there too and said a few things I'm not entirely proud of, but were brutally honest at the same time.

The basics of the LTR is there was no equal partnership. Shes lazy, she won't even clean up her own space. I routinely have to clear empty craft brew bottles and various used napkins from her own computer desk, she doesn't cook, she can't cook, she barely cleans the house and she only does laundry when she can't stand the stink of her own clothes anymore. Granted...I've got a fairly high tolerance bar for procrastination, but hers is kind of beyond my tolerance any further. Add in her adult ADHD and chronic depressive disorder and I just can't fix her....my total fidelity and emotional focus and my entire financial capability which has been relatively substantial, and my dedication to our relationship has not been enough to fix her, so its likely nothing ever will.

So with that, we're about to split up, and I am heading into weird territory. I'm 45, I've had a good average of female companionship over my adulthood but no kids and no emotional entanglements that persist into the current decade or anything.

So I guess my issue is....I kind of have some standards, which I almost feel embarrassed to have for some odd reason, and over the last couple of weeks...once she closed on her house and I closed on mine.....I started looking at Tinder and the simple facts are...the women in my age group are all carrying kids from previous LTRs...not something I'm interested in getting involved in...and to be fair, they don't seem to care about how they look either. I may be 45 and my hairline may not be what it used to be, but I'm still 6'2"" and 190 lbs and my waistline is still a 34 and while I'm certainly no fitness model...I'm not entirely alongside the idea of consigning myself to the occasional date with someone elses mother.

I've considered dipping down towards the high 20s or so in my right swipes...but I feel like I'm that weird old dude thats being pathetic with younger women.

Overall....I'm kind of okay on my own, but I wouldn't mind some dinner and company on occasion....and I feel like I'm in the weirdest place in my life ever. In my 20's I barely even had to go out...women just happened, in my 30s I was single by choice, but still had options...and now here I am at 45, with nothing lasting to show for everything I've invested, personally, and emotionally, in several women through my life, and I feel like I'm out of options.

[Support] I can't get over a co-worker who doesn't like me back,"Never posted here before but if even one person can comment I will probably feel better.

It all started two years ago when I moved to the opposite coast of the US and got a job at an amazing company with great perks and a stocked kitchen (most of the time). I meet this girl who's about three months older than me and we're both recently out of college but we live in completely different bubbles. She's way out of my league, sweet, popular, determined, shy, and just a great person. I'm a huge nerd who is forward, abrasive, and think I'm all that because I've traveled a lot and lived in different places. We have some mutual friends in the office but basically everyone likes her and I would say about half the office can't stand me. I'm loud and obnoxious, she's fun and bubbly.

She's your classic california girl and I'm your standard new york douchebag. Looks wise she's a 10 and I'm about a 7.

Very soon after meeting her I ask her out and she's not interested. 
I try to lay low and sometimes we're forced into meetings together and I end up liking her all over again right whenever I feel like I get over her. She also tries to be friends and would reach out at times and naturally I didn't know how to deal with it and would be awkwardly silent or inappropriate. 

I'm usually pretty good at small talk but the only thing I can ever say to her are compliments, and the last time I did that was in a club in Vegas and she said thanks then pushed me away with a sad look in her eyes (last weekend) which I'll get more into later.

I've gotten so angry at her and so happy with her and due to the fact I've got no filter I've just told her instead of doing the smart thing and cooling off. She's always been a trooper and even though I've been very rude at times or very sweet I feel like I'm causing her pain because she doesn't like me but I keep pushing for it - our mutual friend even sent an article once about how pain of unrequited love hurts the rejecter too and basically I need to back off.

There are times when we can talk for a while and then times when it's very short sentences. All our female mutual friends keep telling me to move on and all the male ones keep saying to go after her.

This last weekend we partied in Vegas and she was with another guy. Her friends were telling me they were together and this was a time I felt like I was over her but as soon as I saw them holding hands I realized I was not. I told her she was beautiful again and she gave me sad eyes, murmured thanks, and pushed me away. 

We talked about it on Monday and she said it wasn't a thing, just great friends. This happened once before as well when other mutual friends told me she had a boyfriend, I got mad, we fought, and she told me he was an ex and that there was nothing between them. I don't know why she tries to console me or tell me these things when she doesn't like me, she's honestly just a really nice person.

This time I didn't get mad and just explained to her that I need to work on myself and felt like everyone's moving on but I'm being left behind. I will probably have these up's and down's - days when I feel like I will delete her number and never talk to her and days when I feel like I should ask her how she's doing every day. Knowing me it will be a mix of the two so yay for diversification I guess. I just want to be a good friend at this point and learn to be mature about things. 

TL;DR - Like a co-worker for 2 years, showed her the good the bad and the ugly, doesn't like me back but is an incredible friend. Not sure how to move on and be a better friend.",OneY

"Help dealing with my ""bitterness"".","Hi guys, Lurker here and mostly everywhere on reddit. This is a slightly different post; more like a request for practical advice.

I am a 25 year old dude, of below average height: 5'7"" in the US. Over the years, my height has affected my views about myself, women and in general, people. The sort of treatment I received in real life, as well as the tons of tweets/status updates/comments from women that ""short men should cease to exist"" has not only destroyed my self esteem but also made me see women my age as shallow people. As much as the rational person in me want's to fight this idea, the hurt person in me wants to cling on to it.


I can't try online dating because 6' is a standard requirement. Bars are useless because most guys are way taller than me and to any observer it is obvious that this one factor matters a lot in the initial stage. I am pretty active, play sports with girls in my team, hang out with female friends, so I am not lonely or hateful towards them. But deep down, everytime they introduce me to their boyfriends, I can help but feel a little bit of disdain for me. And I am not even terribly short.


Often, when I don't put my height on dating profiles, I get quite a lot of matches, but sure as hell it will come up at some point (and rightly so).


When I visit r/short I cant help but realize how much my self formed opinion matches theirs. I have never posted or commented there, but I have never felt so at home yet so heartbroken.


I feel like I have lost my complete sense of masculinity along the way when I realized that most women don't even consider a short man as man. ""Tall and handsome"" has become a minimum requirement. I don't see any attractive short men in the media anymore. There are no role models. We are completely discarded by the society; butt of jokes.


I have completely given up on dating. I am sure I can find women who want to be in long term relationship but I doubt I'd ever meet a girl who'd want to fuck me, to put it bluntly. Would be nice to feel attractive and sort of like a ""real man"" for once in my life. I think I am denied something primal, purely on the basis of a recent cultural shift.


At the same time I harbor some sort of contempt for women. I am not proud, or vocal about it. I am sure a lot of tall me see me as a ""manlet"" too, but since I am not attracted to them, it hurts less.

We walk by it, my dog starts sniffing it and his leash gets tagged between his legs.

Difficulty Getting an Erection with New People [21M],"So this has been an issue I have noticed over the last couple of years, and its pretty frustrating.

However, when it involves someone new, 7/10 times its difficult for me to get an erection at all, or if i do, its still semi-flaccid (and pretty pitiful). I know the obvious answer is that the more you know someone, the more comfortable sexually you will feel around them, yada yada yada, but its honestly a pretty shitty feeling to perform sub-par when your interacting with someone for the first time (and honestly makes them less likely to fuck you again).

I could go on and on. I've had girls that looked like 14 hit on me. I've been asked for my ID for buying beer (legal to buy at 16). I've been mistaken for the son of a buddy of mine that is the same age as me.

I'm actually a rather social person but in recent years I found myself subconsciously avoiding meeting new people or getting in situations where my age will play a role.

I'm honestly scared about my future because I don't think my face is ever going to change and the more I age, the more absurd it well get. I can't grow a proper beard and I already dress and act like an adult.

With that said, is anybody else like me? How do you deal with it?

Using this as a means to find closure...,"It has been about a month since my now-ex and I broke up.  I am 20 years old and we dated for 4 and a half years, I thought I was going to marry her, then I found evidence on her phone that she was planning on hooking up with my coworker, whom I was letting crash on my couch for 2 weeks until he shipped out for the Air Force.  When confronted, she let me know that she had already cheated on me, but not with my coworker, she had slept with my roommate several months prior to us being roommates.

In my mind, it was bad enough to find out my SO was planning on cheating, then to find out that she had already cheated on me.  Not only that, she was the one who encouraged us to be roommates to begin with, only for me to later find out that I live under the same roof as the guy who fucked her.

I was an emotional wreck, I was angry, then I became depressed, then I dropped my college classes for the rest of the semester.  The easiest thing for me to say right now is that I am going through the worst heartache and pain that I ever thought possible.  The first few days were the worst, processing the betrayal, then helping my ex pack up her belongings; after she left, I couldn't even throw away her forgotten shower sponge without crying.  Honestly the best memories of my life had been made with this woman and I still can not wrap my mind around the fact that she was even capable of the things she did.   I had money saved to buy a wedding ring...

Things got ugly the last time we talked, we were in Starbucks so we kept it civil but we were still mean to each other regardless, and the words coming out our mouths were nothing more than daggers aimed at each others' throats.  What keeps pulling me back and torturing my heart and mind is this, the last thing I asked was what she would tell friends and family who asked 'why did you break up?'  
Her response, ""I wasn't happy""

Accepting some of my own faults, I wasn't the most financially stable, when my car broke down during the summer I had to borrow money from her to pay rent but I paid her back within a week.  I could have asked my parents for the money but I like to think that I was being more independent by not going to mom and dad first.

I'm trying to move on, my pride tells me that I deserve to be with someone better, common sense says that I can't trust her, but my broken heart has had some time to sift through years of memories and its telling me that I may never get over this.",OneY

I finally figured out a way to deal with anger without hurting my partner's feelings,"I've struggled with anger issues most of my life. I've had them very much in control in the last few years. I meditate, I work out, I immerse myself in peaceful philosophies, and I try to be a good person to everyone around me. But sometimes, it still boils over. That happened this week because of overwork (zero days off since October) and several other interpersonal/environmental factors at my work.

I work in the same office as my girlfriend. Since we've been together, she has never experienced one of my episodes of true anger. She doesn't know that I get to a point where all I want to do is take a baseball bat to everything in the office and scream in people's faces. When I'm at this point, it's all I can do to keep it together, and I'm not receptive to anything to cheer me up. I can't take compliments, jokes, or caresses.

In my previous relationship, I was unable to explain this to my partner. She would try to snap me out of it, and it would make it worse. Yesterday, I finally came up with a way to explain it. I told my girlfriend that if I say to her the words ""Code Red"", that it means she has done nothing wrong, but that I need space to cool off. I will likely be silent and isolate myself for a day or so, until it passes. She totally understood, and I feel really great and safe about that.

Communication! Who knew.

TL;DR I instituted a code word with my gf so she knows that I'm having an episode of rage and that I just need time. ",OneY

What is one thing you've always wanted to try with your partner in the bedroom?,"My gf has said she's feeling adventurous and wants to spoil me this evening by trying something new. Neither of us is vanilla but we have limited experience with bdsm/kink - restraints and rougher things are all on the table, physical violence like choking and slapping (other than that ass 😉) are off the table. 

She has expressed openness to the idea of anal, but doesn't feel quite ready yet, so that's not available for tonight. A few ideas I've had so far include role play, tantric techniques, some outer assplay, or maybe just progressing our experience with restraints and such. 

I'm curious what else you've all done or always wanted to do with your partner when seeking pleasure for both parties!",OneY

[Phimosis] Finally feel comfortable as everything works (X-Post /r/sex),"Hu Guys, I Wanted to share my experience with Phimosis as theres a lot of scary info out there. If you look into it you might scare yourself but I've managed to help mine to a point its almost not a problem any more, I'm now just a little tiny bit tight. 

Some conditions are completely overlooked in the school based Sex education, Phimosis is one of them. Horror stories online about circumcisions going wrong and people being genuinely unhappy with it. 

For some men there is another way, I want people to just realise that it may (but still might) not be your only option.

According to my research (I'm not a doctor guys) In simple terms, two types of phimosis. Attached and Detached. If you are attached that means your forskin is still stuck to you and you can't try stretching (really guys, there are some awful pics online of this stuff.)

Option 2 if you are detached (get doc to confirm), you can try stretching. There are excersizes and products you can buy to help you. 
My product recomendations (experience based), 

Phimocure (doesnt look like the most professional product but when you get the hang of it, it works). Cheap too. After Phimocure has been used all the way to the biggest buy flesh tunnels start with the same size as the final phimocure 30mm. 
BUT YOU HAVE TO COMMIT 3 TIMES A DAY, yes its uncomfortable, yes its a hassle but you have to do it if you want it to work.

Creams: 
E45 Moisturising Lotion (for softening, wait a while after using)
Cream the comes with Phimocure is also good post stretch. 
You could do with a steroid cream from your doc to prevent scarring also! So go talk to them! 

So guys, stop fretting. I fretted for years and years over this. now I'm mid 20s and still a virgin. ",OneY

Professional sportsmen coming forward with sexual abuse.,"Not really a text post, but there's no neat article that Sims this up.

Recently in the UK a number of ex-professional sportsmen have been coming forward as victims of serial paedophile Barry Bennell. I think it's a huge thing that so many men are, particularly in an area that has not had an openly gay sportsman in for over 20 years due to the prevalence of macho culture. So I thought I'd link the articles for those interested.

Help support a redditor who recently lost his children,"Earlier today I read a chilling news article posted in another subreddit about a woman who had murdered her two children (ages 3 and 7) by stabbing them in the neck in order to keep her husband who was divorcing her from ever seeing them again. In the comment section of the article I learned that the husband from the story is a redditor (/u/jasoninhell) who had recently posted about his cheating wife in a relationship advice subreddit. 

after reading through his post and the news article detailing the aftermath of the situation I really couldn't help but feel terrible for this guy. I saw that he posted elsewhere that he has a gofundme, and thought that it might be helpful to post it here to get some support for him. I've seen redditors pull together and accomplish some really great things over the years and I feel like this guy could really use any help that he can get right now. 

I've messaged the mods of this subreddit to make sure this was ok with them. I have decided not to link to any other subreddits in effort not to break any rules or cause unnecessary drama, and I have sent /u/jasoninhell a message asking to make sure this was ok with him. 

This is the GoFundME that he has set-up to help cover the expenses of his children's funeral.

"Recommend a shampoo which fights hair loss, or other options?","I told my hair stylist about my preferred shampoo, it was a detergent which stripped my hair, combined with a conditioner which made it.. un-stripped..? 

She said ""don't use that, it probably has sulfates in it, try this 'conditioner-only shampoo' "" - it made my hair softer and feel better, but I noticed my hair is falling out much more quickly! 
With this shampoo, there's more build up on the follicles than there used to be.

Doing a preliminary google search returns many scammy results. Websites dedicated to reviewing this category of shampoo, but they're all brands I've never heard of.

Can anyone make a recommendation that won't break the bank? I'm also open to pills, I know they have side-affects but so long as they're not permanent, I'd be open to try it.

I don't really mind my hair falling out, I'm just not happy with the rate at which it's now doing it. I'm hoping there's a simple shampoo &amp; conditioner, or other application which can help. Previously I was using Tresemme deep clean and deep restore shampoo (black and white bottles). 

I'd also like to get away from that brand, as the back of the bottle says ""we believe every woman deserves the best hair experience"" -- I wrote and said ""it would be nice if the back of your bottle was genderless"" and they responded ""we receive this complaint a lot! thanks!"" -- trivial, but if there's a better alternative option than Tresemme, I'm interested!",OneY

"Guys please, please help :(","Something that has never happened to me occurred today.

By the way, I'm 20 years old but I pretty much look like a 15-16 year old and people usually get surprised when I say I'm 20.

I was doing my groceries, I left the store (Vons with a small parking lot) and all of a sudden a man (I'd say in his mid forties) in a SUV compliments my hairstyle. 
I'm white but for some reason have afro hair, so a lot of people like to point out the hairdo and how cool they think it looks on me which is what this guy was doing.
He also called me cute but I legitimately thought he was trying to be funny or some shit so it completely went over my head without giving it much thought. I mean, what kinda man would say that to a possibly underage guy in a Vons parking lot anyway?

He started making small talk, asking me if I like hiking and then pointing out how nice the sunset would look if we went together to the mountains together ASAP.

Also, I don't intend to sound mean but little old me completely forgot that even as a man there's a chance that another man could hit on you but I just didn't understand what this SUV guy was up to since I completely forgot gay guys existed. (yes I'm retarded)

Anyway, THIS was red flag number one: for a strange man in an SUV in a (very public and open parking lot) to be asking me this? And telling me I'm cute? At first I thought he was socially inept but after dismissing this and talking with him for a bit longer I started to realize... (and I fully regret not stopping the convo right there)
(There's so many more red flags after this I'm just not gonna point them out)

He got out of his car and asked for my phone number to which I said no, but kept talking with him. He was parked in front of the Vons store so I didn't feel in any real danger, so super retarded me kept talking with this guy.
Very slowly I started to notice his way of speaking, his tone and gestures and how he'd look at me in a weird way every once in a while.
I finally snapped and ended the convo to which he said he wanted to follow me to my car.

You know how teachers talk to children in kindergarten? His tone changed to that as he kept following and asked me why I thought he started talking to me to which I replied ""I probably know why"" with the obvious intention that I didn't want to talk about it and wanted him to stop and that I wasn't interested. He started calling me beatiful, cute and sexy which started to really creep me out and scare me.

Then before getting to my car he said; hey, listen I'm not the most handsome guy out there, I don't have good looks and I'm old but I can show you a good time. I was shocked; not that I was shocked from before already but this hit hard. He didn't get it, I'm not gay, I never implied I was interested in him yet he starts directly telling me he wants to fuck me in the ass right there in this public parking lot in broad daylight.

I very calmly told him I don't swing that way to which he replied ""I would've loved to see you naked!"" followed by a creepy pat on my back as he left. 

I felt psychologically violated at that point. As a straight man, for another man to do this to me in a public space so nonchalantly like that. I was shocked, terrified. Never in my life have I been treated like this by another man... And you know, what? It wasn't just that, but after assessing my memories of the event after heading to my friend's house I noticed how suspicious this guy's attitude was.

Basically in an SUV waiting for someone to come out. He starts small talk and tries to escalate to the point where he can persuade you to get buttfucked by him. He never asked my age probably risking obscene behavior towards an underage person. And for fuck's sake he sure as heck thought I was underage since he almost treated me like a child the whole time...

Anyway, me personally, I feel psychologically violated and I get shivers thinking about the way this gross man looked at me... But what worries me the most is how he might be doing the same thing over and over and over again to people like me until he gets results. I don't want anyone to be in danger, especially children since he was definitely some sort of predator, most likely pedophile.

I'm a dumbass and didn't get his license plate but I could still head to the police station tomorrow.
Question is, how should I tell the police about this? What do I say? Was this basically sexual harassment or just disorderly conduct? What about the pedophilia suspicions; can I even report that?
As for the psychological damage I'll just have to hope I forget about what happened and never make the same mistake again.

This happened in California by the way.

TL;DR - Walked out Vons grocery, weird man in SUV starts making small talk; tries to persuade me, a possibly underage person, into getting buttfucked. Causes psychological damage and am worried he might be a pedo predator attempting the same thing on other people like me. What do?

EDIT - Just wanted to mention I'm a very friendly and outgoing guy so if someone points out my hair or my t shirts (which a lotta people do) I always end up talking for a while with strangers which is why I talked to this person and tried not to judge them for their weird behavior (dumbass me)

EDIT 2 - Guys, I wanted to apologize for my username. Given my situation I know it was a very insensitive name to choose; amidst the shock I thought this name would be funny to use but it's not. It was very insensitive of me. I'm very sorry, please forgive me.

"Need advice. Cum is not normal, and doctors aren't helping.","Hey guys. I've got an issue I need some advice on. And before anyone asks, I've already seen 2 urologists about this.

First off, I've had pretty intense varicocele my whole life. With it has come some dull, achey pain, and some days, it's hard just to walk. My urologist (at the time) said this was completely normal, and to medicate the pain with Ibuprofen or whatever. I've mostly just gritted my teeth and bore it, because I didn't want to live the rest of my life on Ibuprofen (I'm only 29).

Over the last month, the pain in my left testicle/groin has gotten a bit worse, and my jizz has been dark brown. I know this is ""old blood"" somehow coming out with my ejaculate. Last week, the pain was bad enough that it hurt simply to move, so I went to the ER. They did an ultrasound and found no torsion, no epididymitis, nothing but a varicocele (which the doctor felt necessary to inform me of, even after I told her I knew I had it). She referred me to urologist who I saw today.

I explained my symptoms, and the nurse poked and prodded my groin and nutsack. She told me that I did, in fact, have varicocele (again, why is everyone telling me this like I don't know?). She then left for a couple of minutes and then came back and told me I was fine and had no reason to worry. I got a bit flustered and reiterated that I am ejaculating blood without having recently experienced any trauma to my groin, and I've been ejaculating blood for 4 weeks now, AND my testicular pain has grown exponentially over the past month. She got this look on her face that basically said ""Oh, you poor baby"" and then she said, and I quote ""Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Dr. Blah has been a urologist for 20 years, and he's not concerned. I'm not concerned.""

She *did* admit that I was right, and that ejaculating blood isn't ""normal,"" but she told me there was no reason to worry. She then added that there's no way the blood could be coming from my varicocele (something I never even suggested in the first place), so then I asked her where else it could come from. Her exact words were, ""I really don't know. Perhaps the prostate?"" I just kind of sat in disbelief that after talking to 2 urologists, and a trip to the ER, the best I'm getting is ""idk, but you really need to stop freaking out."" I've given urine samples that all appear to be clean, but no one's given me a prostate exam or taken any blood for anything.

Ejaculation itself is still pretty pleasurable, with no tinge of pain, but almost immediately afterward, I feel a burning sensation in my left groin/nut (which I've told to ever doctor I've seen about this).

Has anyone else heard of having a problem like this? Has anyone dealt with it? I just want to stop cumming blood. Why is that so hard to fix? Why is everyone acting like this is no big deal?",OneY

Confession of an Abuser,"I am not exactly sure where to post this, as this is my first time using Reddit. I saw a similar post on the subject on this subreddit, and I am a man and this is a problem that has been on my chest for a few days now. Probably longer, I just didn't realize it until recently.

I am someone who has committed acts of emotional abuse on someone that I was in a relationship with for approximately 2 years. I often threatened to kill her for various actions, and I called her names and undercut her achievements to make myself feel better. I basically made her feel bad for everything she wanted me to do, and I threw fits and made her life a living hell anytime she wanted me as a companion among her friends.
She broke up with me right after I went to college, and this was the first time in the span of 2 years that I had admitted that I was emotionally abusive. This is where the story gets weird, and questions of my own mental health begin to rise.

For the next year, I was thoroughly convinced that the reasons why she hated me were based in nothing, and that she was just a terrible person. I had this idea in my head that I had done nothing wrong, and she broke up with me because I went to college. I then hated her for breaking up with me when I needed her, and blamed her for all of my problems. There were a few nights in this span of a year where I sent her drunk text threatening to hurt her, and threatening to hurt basically anyone she associated with. This is a woman who I actually told ""I love you"" often, but I see now that in saying that, whether I knew it or not, I was lying.She was around me a lot, because my friends were, and are still good friends with her. My friends have started to grow away from me, probably because they know what a monster I can be. So what changed?

The other day, I read a tweet that she had sent out with a picture of a conversation we had over text, where I had threatened her life because of some random text she had sent to a mutual friend that I didn't even know the context of.It was at this point that the illusion of my innocence that I had in my brain had faded away, and I felt an immense wave of guilt. I immediately apologized to her for everything that had happened, having no intention of being forgiven, because I know what I did cannot be taken back. I cannot un-scar her memory, and I cannot remove the two years of pain that I put her through. 

I post this because after a lot of thought and self reflection, I think there is a possibility there are other people like me in the world, that have been abusive and truly don't believe they did it. There really is no way that I can right the wrong, but I really want to make a difference for the future. I want to help all victims of emotional abuse, and help perpetrators understand what they are doing. I am also seeking medical and mental treatment for obvious underlying anger issues that I have, so that I never hurt anyone ever again.",OneY

"i do not know if this belongs here, but i need to get it off my chest, its my birthday and im tired.","so the first thing;
 today is my birthday, im 19 now.
im feeling so empty and weird, i dont have a family that will congratulate me, i dont have any friends that will and i also dont have any work buddies that will. everytime i am trying to make contact to people i fail miserably, people always see me as very arrogant and say that i see myself as the best, i dont know why that is. im always listen carefully, trying to help people and i really try to be nice, but as soon as i want to tell anything, may it be that i finally did my first kickflip or whatever, people instantly go away and dont care, i dont know if its the way i do talk or move or whatever, but im fed up with this shit, i got literally 0 friends for the past 3 years of my life, i tried to change so much stuff and not once it did help. now im not even trying to change anymore im just not caring, but that feels wrong, i dont need many friends or a big friendly family, but 1-2 close friends... i just dont know what to do, people dont even care enough about me to say a nice thing on my birthday.

im not even very ugly or unclean or whatever, i cant get behind it, ive read so much here on reddit what to try and improve, but nope, not a single time did i success.

the second thing is this (and the last) particular day, i saved 80€ for a damn skateboard because im tired of sitting in front of my pc playing osu and counter strike with people who dont like me anyway. and i got to a local shop and bought 2 paysafecards 50-30€, i got to my pc, got to the store, entered the pins and BAM error message, codes invalid i got back to the store who said they cant help me, i called the psc hotline and they dont have these id´s registered, i got scammed out of my 80€ sweet, so no birthday gift for me i guess, fine im gonna play some CS, i  go to my pc, starting cs, bluescreen, wont turn on again. Nice. hard drive is dead, so no CS for me. yay. i just went to bad after that, the next day (today) i woke up and the first thing that happened was that my fucking mirror fell off the wall and ive got some sweet small cuts all over my feet. why. why the fuck is shit like this always happening to me, did anyone of you ever had a time in your life like this? does it go away? what do i have to do?

"How do i make this ""trust"" thing work again ?","Most of my friends would tell you i'm one of the most stoic person they've seen in life, borderline apathetic. I'm just good at hiding behind a mask... I'm the biggest softie.


I've got my heart broken many many times by girlfriends and just friends who  didn't gave a fuck about being good persons and put themselves over our relationship. I've broken those relationships at first offense every time, as they show to be sorry for getting caught rather than being sorry for being shit people who betray those who put their trust in them. They'll always come up with some mental gymnastics to justify dickish behavior without admitting fault. 


I'm starting to think this is just human nature, to act impulsively on a desire whatever the damage that comes with that act might be. That i'll always end up betrayed anyway when i needed to be supported. 


I take pride in being the best person i can be to anyone who's in my life.  Even the dickheads. I'll help out my friends to the best of my abilities and i'll never betray them. I'm not a pushover by any means, but i'll try to be the kindest i can be, or at least try to do some damage control. I just wanna do my shit in peace.


I don't do this for someone in particular, well, i do it for myself, as they say, ""be the change you want to see in the world"". But i'm starting to loose faith, that the kind of bond i long for is some kind of unicorn.


It might sound ridiculous, but every time i read or watch a good story with those kind of unbreakable relationships where both of them would go to unbelievable lengths for each other despite the adversity and temptations, i get sad for days. Because that's the thing i want the most in life but can never quite reach. Every time i thought i had it, i got proven wrong. Shit hurts. Even those who i'm the closest to, aren't people i could trust my life with, i know they all have ""triggers"" who would make them pick themselves over us, it just has to be the right thing to bait them with, girl/money/power whatever. And if they can be baited so easily, then they weren't reliable people in the first place.


I feel like i can't be friend with anyone i don't trust, but at the same time, there's nobody to trust. This really saddens me, i don't want to be lonely my whole life because i can't get over that lack of trust... I don't really know what i'm searching for by wring all this out, but it would help to know i'm not the only one feeling like this because, by typing this out, i feel like the whole thing is really childish and i should grow up already.

My male friends and I *do* sometimes discuss attractive women (for that matter, so do my wife and I), and not merely in abstract terms...but nobody ever says anything disrespectful or even vaguely rapey...  

Anyway...how common *is* that kind of thing anyway? I honestly don't know.  

Bonus question: is there any plausible defense of it? I mean...I've always had a naturally fairly low tolerance for that kind of thing (though I also have a low tolerance for the feminist thought police)...but...is there any chance that he might have meant something like ""many women enjoy it when I am sexually aggressive""?

Do any other men find themselves rejecting the idea that depression may be affecting them?,"For a while I thought that it may be a problem for myself because of suicidal thoughts, lack of energy and some of the other typical signs. But often times I find myself saying ""you're just using it as an excuse to be a whiner there are other explanations"" or ""these symptoms don't sound nearly as bad as what you've read on /r/depression""

It's just extra conflict that's driving me crazy at this point and I don't know what exactly is right",OneY
r/foreveralone is the only place I feel I belong and I hate that fact,"Right now I'm reeling from some revelations in my relationship about how my girlfriend isn't and never has been sexually attracted to me. I'm 30 and she has been my only relationship; after a lifetime of rejection, bullying or being invisible I thought that I had finally found reaaon to feel attractive, like a man, desired. And then I find out it was all basically a lie. 

And now I'm back to where I started, feeling ugly, undesirable, and being treated as an object devoid of all sexuality when all I want is to feel desired, and like a real man. The frustration of feeling that I'll never have what I so desperately need makes me want to scream, beat my fists against the wall and grab everyone that passes and demand ""why don't you want me?!""

But I can't do that, in fact I can't express these feelings of hurt, frustration and despair without being judged. People will tell me I'm an entitled douche, that I'm just whining, they'll assume things about me, that I don't take care of myself or I'm a creep. They'll say they're sick of guys complaining about how they suck with women. On reddit posts that do complain about things like this are downvoted and posters deemed to be just not trying hard enough. Expressing a need to feel sexy, wanted, attractive usually leads to being told that we're weak for needing outside validation; a strong man is self assured and so we must not be strong men. All of which only reinforces these negative thoughts and beliefs. 

So I have nowhere to talk about these feelings. Nowhere except places like r/foreveralone which is where the bitter and lonely go to hear their own echoes. And those echoes get amplified until it's all we can hear and the sound of compassion is drowned out. 

I don't want to be one of those people that sits and curses at the ""normies"" but where else can I go for some understanding and empathy? 

Right now I do feel forever alone and I need to talk about without judgement or scorn but also without reinforcing bitter attitudes. And it feels like as a man there's nowhere I can get that. 


I hope that was at least somewhat coherent.

I thought I was past this [vent],"I just need to get this off my chest. I am a married man in my mid 30’s. Several months ago I started playing this video game and ended up playing with this one girl (20) who friended me in the game. We started to play together regularly, usually with other people, but occasionally just the two of us. At first no big deal. She often called me her big brother, which was fine with me as I am much older, married, and I wasn’t out there looking for romance. After playing together for a few weeks, maybe a month or longer, she asked me if I had snapchat, I told her I did not, but she convinced me to get it (this was a mistake, I thought it would fine since I was “big brother”). Maybe this is a generational thing, I am not sure, but she snaps me a lot, like 4+ times a day most days (not the level of communication I would expect from a little sister). I snap her back, at first not to be rude. This goes on for a while we are snapping back in forth for weeks, suddenly I realize I have a huge crush on this girl. I am more excited to get snaps from her than I am to get texts from my wife.  I am thinking about her constantly and can’t get her out of my mind. I am really confused because she is still calling me big brother, she even sometimes talks about guys she is trying to flirt with, but the level of communication and some of the content she is sending (pictures of her dressed cute, short clips of her telling a joke, all things I would consider “flirty”) is giving me serious mixed signals. Anyway, I broke everything off and I told her I was thinking about her way to often, that I decided to delete my snapchat account (which I did) and that I wouldn’t be playing that video game anymore. This whole situation really has messed me up, I feel kind of like I am a piece of shit for getting such a big crush on someone that isn’t my wife, and I honestly feel love sick from breaking communication with her. I believe I made the right decision. I am done venting.",OneY

I want to know your guys experience with things like that and what caused you to have these thoughts. I've read around and most will say they have but never why or how their life was when they experienced these.

I believe mine to be a combination of that isolation and paranoia with the fact im 22, sexually active but I also Masterbate way too much (3+ a day for years and years) And I figured maybe all of these things are creating these thoughts. 

Maybe I'm bicurious or bisexual, but I have no real sexual or romantic attraction to men.

What's your mask? What's underneath?,"I just watched this documentary: http://therepresentationproject.org/film/the-mask-you-live-in/ on Netflix.

A lot of people who were interviewed put the blame on (other) men. BUT BUT..a lot of people who spoke including educators like Ashanti Branch, did put the blame on the society. About humiliation as a punishment for boys, about social pressure to shoulder responsibility and to be strong. They also touch the topic of suicide. But it also sort of demonizes men as how we do all the vile violent shit and objectify women. 

But what stood out the most was Ashanti Branch's ""mask"" and his approach towards young boys.

He passed around a mask and asked them to write on one side, what they look like to others and on the other what they hide with that mask. These were teenagers.

The mask always said words like happiness, fun, entertainment, outgoing. The other side? Anger, pain, despair, fear...
It cut close to home.

So much that for a moment, I had to control myself from the overwhelming emotions of realizing my mask.

My mask: confidence, strength, humor, non-chalance, success. Underneath: pain (people and past), failure (relationships), anger (injustice...unfairness..doublestandards), insecurity and responsibility.

I apologize beforehand if you find this post cringeworthy.

Test 1 Free T  7.0 pg/ml ref 9.3 - 26.5 - 

Test 2 (most recent) :Free T 72.8 ref range 46-224.0 (pg/ml) 

I had several sperm anaylysis done and they are relativley normal with some things being low end of normal. 

Volume: 1.8 mL                                     ( &gt; 1.5mL)

Concentration: 71 million/mL            ( &gt; 20 million/mL)

Motility 66 % motile                             ( &gt; 50% motility)

Morphology (shape)  5 % normal       ( &gt; 4% normal by strict criteria)

Next week im going for surgery so I can put this behind me. For anyone who has had this procedure done what was you're experiance? How was youre recovery? Did you notice a difference in T Levels and Sperm levels?  Im having the micro surgical Varicocelectomy done if that helps.

EDIT: 

Got the surgery today.  Felt a lot better afterwards then expected.  Currently home right now bout to watch some TV.  The doctor said my varicocele was a lot larger then on the ultra sound which he found  really surprising. This was a surprise to me as well since they didn't really feel I needed the surgery due how small it kept showing up. Anyways if anyone wants to know how the recovery goes feel free to PM me. ",OneY
PSA: Blood in your semen is not necessarily indicative of a severe condition,"I saw a text post on here yesterday and the guy and his wife seemed to be panicking after they saw blood in his semen. The post is now gone, but I felt maybe posting this here would be relevant so more people see it.

Basically, blood in your semen is not necessarily a sign of something serious. In fact, it might not be a sign of anything at all, beyond a broken capillary during your erection. It's only if it happens frequently or if the amount of blood is significant that you should be worried. Now, ""frequently"" and ""significant"" are subjective words, so let me put it in a way you can understand: If you came and you can see a tiny streak of blood in your globs of semen once, don't have a panic attack. This isn't to say you shouldn't consult if it happens regularly. But, you know, don't lose sleep because you think you're going to die of ball cancer after seeing that pink streak in your semen.

Sorry if this post is kind of silly, but I felt as if it might be a stressful experience for many men and their partners and knowing this would help dedramatize it.",OneY

Can we talk birth control?,"Hey there Y'all,

Can we talk about birthcontrol for a minute?

I've always used condoms in my albeit limited sexual history (She's my only partner), I have felt pretty safe from unwanted pregnancy with them but they are not exactly spontaneous as it seems I'm always having sex in the room the condoms are not in.

My girlfriend recently went to her gyno and got a prescription for the Nuva Ring based on the doctor's recommendation.

She started it with her period as directed last week but thought she had lost it when using her diva cup so tonight we had sex with a condom as usual.

A short while later we wanted to have more sex and when I was fingering her it was a surprise that I found the ring so we had sex a second time without a condom and for the first time I ejaculated inside her.

It was a nice feeling, Warmer and wetter which was pretty awesome but I'm honestly not sure if it was worth any extra risk of pregnancy, Her doctor led her to believe the Nuva ring had less risk than a condom for unwanted pregancy but I haven't found stats to back that up.

I only know of two options that can give me control, Condoms and a Vasectomy which honestly sounds scary with a risk of nerve damage and constant pain if it goes wrong.

I've searched and haven't found anything else for men currently, I have read of two possible future options but it doesn't sound like Vasalgel is going anywhere anytime soon.

Should I worry about the Nuva ring? Is it worth the extra work to keep with the condoms, Should I think about both?

I'd love some input.

I will keep updating this as I heal, this probably won't get any people seeing it now but for people that end up in my situation I hope it helps, thanks

Hi all, my name is James and I run a Pittsburgh-based men's organization named Libertus. We're on a mission to bring dramatically more awareness to the private challenges facing men and could really use your help.

This is a link to our State of Men Survey, a quick and anonymous questionnaire that asks about your biggest issues, what changes you'd like to see in your life, and how you see fellow men struggling around you. 

Our work is supported by the Center of the Study of Men &amp; Masculinities at Stony Brook University, one of the only men's programs in the US. 

The final results will be kept open and available for all. We hope for this to be the first in a set of surveys that help shatter the silence around men's issues so we can create a better world for men and women alike.

Went on a bad date last night and confirmed a lot of what I already knew about women with broken home lives.,"Before I dive into the thoughts and opinions I've been wrestling with over the past twelve hours or so, I want to preface this with saying that your mileage may vary and my experience is merely anecdotal and what I've encountered first hand. I also have been awake since 7am when I woke up to the news of a drunk driver (a woman) hitting my car at 3am that I had parked in the street (minimal damage thankfully, but spent the morning dealing with local PD, my Tuesday morning has felt more like a Monday for sure).

Anyway, the point of this post is that I had one of the worst dates of my life last night and it confirmed a lot of suspicion I already had when it came to giving this girl a chance, driving nearly forty-five minutes both ways to take her out to dinner.

A little background on myself: I'm an average guy, about to turn twenty-three in September, and have done a lot lurking here on this sub as well as over at /r/TheRedPill. I've done a lot of self improvement over the years and feel like I'm a pretty level headed and empathetic individual overall. While I'm not perfect, I strive for a certain level of maturity and self-confidence when it comes to looking for a partner whether it be friends, dating, or a relationship.

What I experienced last night confirmed what I already knew about individuals with broken home lives: if a woman grows up without a strong example of man in her life, they more than likely are going to be very self conscious and socially anxious individuals. The date was with a girl that was twenty years old (about a three year difference) which normally is not too much of a gap, but in this case, her maturity reminded me of dates that I had back when I was closer to the age of seventeen. A little background from what I was able to pick up from her:

-She had just recently reconnected with her biological father about a month ago
-Her mother had long term abusive relationships with multiple partners (no stability at home, never called them 'dad')
-Was also on the receiving end of abuse growing up
-Had problems fighting other children while growing up in school
-Ultimately, admits that she overall has a bad relationship with her family although she is still dependent on them (no driver's license) 
-Revealed all of this information without so much as a preface warning

All of this made the entire date uncomfortable as she kept apologizing for a lot her behavior, self-fulfilling her statements of 'I'm unique' and 'A nerdy girl' and 'Awkward'. When others are not comfortable with themselves they project A LOT of insecurity and it reflects off of whomever they are with. Typically, I'm a pretty confident guy, I know what I have to offer, but being on that date really shook me up and made ME start doubting MYSELF and made me really uncomfortable overall. She would say things that were meant to be compliments, and it would feel like she was just saying things to get me to return the feelings she was trying to send my way but I would just say thank you and change the subject. The worst part was the end of the date, when she was unable to understand I was merely being polite the whole time. I gave her a friendly hug and said goodbye, she said something along the lines of 'I'm used to them going in for a kiss' like she was expecting me to kiss her.. She asked for a second date and I said 'Ill let you know..'. I'm more than likely going to do the right thing and just be honest, say that I'm not interested in hanging out again.

There is an entire generation of women growing up in environments that are damaging them so much that it is going to take YEARS for them to find themselves. Again this is just my experience, but I have dated a lot of girls with these same issues and this seems to be the culmination of my experience: they are without direction and have no sense of confidence or of self, unable to see how emotionally stunted their behavior is. For future reference, asking about family is probably going to be my priority to understand what kind of person they are.

EDIT: I have received a lot of mixed reactions from this post, I was expecting some dissent but not to the magnitude some users have reacted. It's currently sitting at zero karma, however someone over here gilded it so it must have some amount of value.. A lot of you have been great though and I appreciate it. I made this post because I was frustrated with my experience and was not trying to belittle or demean this girl. I received a lot of judgement for what I had to say about her and it's merely a matter of opinion in this case. I'm not an extremely callous, judgemental, and vindictive person; I'm quite the opposite, but I don't tolerate certain behaviors and will not keep company that I disagree with. The type of woman I am searching for is an emotionally mature, financially conscience, adult that believes in responsibility, fidelity, and respect. I know I'm asking for a lot because a lot of these values have been lost on modern day society, and it may not ever happen, but I'm holding onto hope that I may one day find Her because that's all I can do while I continue to learn and grow. I've been told to get off my high horse many a times, but that's NOT how I see myself: better than everyone else. I'm merely trying to find my happiness in life like everyone else is, but when it comes to interacting with the world and the people in it, I refuse to be pulled into the nonsense and follies that cause the strong willed to compromise themselves, their values, or what they know to be right.",OneY

Today I didn't stop to help a little girl who was crying and alone because I was scared of being accused of something or attacked by her family...,"EDIT:Today I didn't stop to help a little girl who was crying and alone because I was scared of being accused of something or *BEING* attacked by her family...

...And now I feel terrible.

As I walked back to my car earlier today there was a little girl (2-5yo?) in a car alone and I could hear her sobbing. At first I went to approach the car but then stopped to reconsider. Before I approached I decided to look around to see if I could see another adult near by (On the phone or something?) but there was no one. Next I noticed the windows were open and it wasn't that hot so she probably wasn't in any danger. The car park is shared by a community centre, a gym, and some near-by houses. I wasn't sure which one of these the parents could be in. 

By now it had been 20-30 seconds of me (A lone adult male) stood staring at a litle girl in a car and I decided that if the parents had left the windows open they probably were looking after her and that they wouldn't be too far away and would be back soon. I decided to leave before anyone got the wrong idea.

Now I feel terrible because there is a million bad things that could have been happening and I just left her there. I'm not even sure what i'm supposed to have done differently without risking causing myself all sorts of problems? Did I do the right thing by not getting involved in other people business? I don't know.

"Moving forward with dating in your 30's, separating new women in life","Hey folks.

Using a throwaway since my friends look at my name from time to time and I don't want the embarrassment of them ragging on me for my occasional serious posts.

Lately I have bene back in the single life and its been harder than I thought. I feel like I've gotten over my ex and been actually lookign forward to meeting who I think really will be the one for me in the future. Until then, hey, meet some new folks and enjoy. Right?!? Right?

I feel like this is a big, nope, its a lot of heartache, frustration, and hours of spent time writing messages, trying to find where I fit, and trying not to be creepy. I've joined a gym and actually been very good at going 4-5 times a week. However I still feel like in ways I'm just so out of place.

I feel like dating at 30 has just become a nightmare. More recently I have just gotten sick of seeing everyone's forced happiness on social media and I fear its making me into the troll under the bridge. I try to healthily avoid it (eg, Facebook time has been nearly cut to 5 min every 48hours) but I feel like I see former female friends I had a thing for all posting rings, and flowers, and dresses. 

So now I am trying to expand my circle and it just feels harder and harder with the people I know. They are all taken themselves and I feel like I'm going to be the lost in time single guy that can't seem to find the right girl.

Before I know the ""have to be happy with yourself"" posts let me preface: my last girlfriend I tried to put a ring on. She said no and thus we parted ways not long after. I know what it means to be in a relationship for 3 years and be the happiest you can be with someone. I feel she's going to be such a hard bar to measure up to (if its even healthy to do so? IDK).


**So, I suppose, TL;DR of the post:**

1: Is it petty to know if you have no shot at any relationship any more with a woman, getting her reminders out of the way? (like, remove from instagram, facebook, snapchat) If so can I do it without being a troll-under-the-bridge?

2: When out of a great relationship, how to you measure the bar of who you date, meet, and not possibly compare to the past?

3: Is dating period in your 30's better (if you stay fit, responsible, ect)

On being beautiful.,"All the coverage of media sexism in the Rio olympics is causing me to reflect on some of my own opinions, and I fully agree with the complaints, so I'm not really going to talk about them. However, I've realized something that I feel like is almost never talked about when sexism is discussed in contexts outside of the olympics: women are actively trying to be seen as human beings that are just as capable as men and not just objects that are pretty to look at, yet _far and away_ the most common compliment I hear given to women _by other women_ is that they're pretty or beautiful. When a woman I know is expressing their feelings of self-doubt publicly on the internet, nearly all of the comments attempting to cheer her up are compliments on her looks, as if they're directly correlated with her self-esteem. I don't see how this type of behavior is at all supposed to help her gain a sense of self-esteem that isn't directly tied to her beauty.

On the flipside, as a guy, even if I put on my nicest clothes, nobody would bat an eye (with the exception of my girlfriend, since she's usually who I dress up for). Honestly, I'm a little bit jealous of the ease with which women seem to receive compliments on their looks, and it turns out that I'm forced to explore alternative means if I want to gain any kind of social acceptance. We're supposed to be treating women as both beautiful _and_ capable, yet there's no rush to even consider the fact that men want basically the same thing.

No real point to this, just wanted to try and put some of these thoughts into words. As a final note, it's my anecdotal belief that a _lot_ of sexist men end up that way because they harbor resentment towards being essentially unwanted, and that a little more focus on boosting the self-esteem of men when it comes to their physical appearance could go a long way towards benefiting women as well.",OneY
What does masculinity mean if we remove families from the equation?,"I feel as though the most integral interpretation of masculinity has been about protecting the wife/children, but in a situation where a lot of us might not want to get married/have kids, what does the concept of being a man mean beyond those concepts?",OneY
The victims victim.,"This is gonna be a long one so prepare yourself.
When I was 16 years old(years ago), I dated a 15 year old girl. She was beautiful, her family amazing and our connection strong. We dated nearly 3 years before she ended up cheating on me and leaving me for another women. Sounds far fetched but is entirely true.
shortly after our departure from each other, I met another women. Moved on, started a new life and everything was well.
Then one day I get a knock on my door, it's my ex girlfriends mother. I open the door to a seriously stern look on her face, I ask her what is going on and she started calling my a discusting, worthless piece of shit rapist. Yelling it loud enough for all of my neighbors to hear. Now I didn't recall raping anyone, so I was completely confused. The conversation ended with ""my daughter told us what you did to her, she told me, her dad, her uncles, her brother, and if you come anywhere near my daughter I'll kill you""
So completely confused, and unable to speak she left. I closed the door, kind of shook up and trying to process what just happened.
Apparently my ex girlfriend had told everyone I had raped her multiple times during our relationship, none of that being true.
I should have seen the red flags when we were dating, she would tell me stories about how when she would spend the night at her best friends house, and how her best friends father would touch her in her sleep. At first I believed her, but then the stories kept getting more and more outrageous to keep me angry, she kept going over to her best friends house, she would always meet her father with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. It took me a while, but I started to realize that she was never happy unless she was the victim some how. She had a habit of fabricating ideas for pity and attention, she can cry on command and does it often.
Shortly after the visit from her mother, I start getting threatening texts talking about how they are going to find my body inside a trash bag floating in the river. This didn't honestly scare me, I'm a big guy and don't get intimidated easily. But I was confused, why all of a sudden does everyone want to kill me?
Months started to go by, rumors spread around and before I knew it, friends started to disappear, old friends would look at me weird. Even people I didn't know started talking about me, I even remember a time when I was single again, asking a girl out and being turned down. Of course I didn't think much of it, she didn't want to go out with me for whatever reason, but a few weeks later she tells her friend that she turned me down because she ""didn't want to get raped by me in an alley way"". I tried to explain to some of my friends that it wasn't true, but I just got labeled as ""the rapist"" and every time I would try to defend myself it would just make it seem like I was lying and trying to shift blame on her.
So after a while, I stopped trying to defend myself and decided to just move 300 miles away and start a new life. I did that for 4 years and then came back to my hometown, soon after getting back home I get an angry message from my girlfriend saying that her brothers friend is the boyfriend of my ex girlfriend, and her boyfriend told my girlfriends brother to tell me that ""'I better stop stalking her, and calling her with threatening phone calls"" like what the hell? I've been gone for 4 years, ZERO contact with this girl in over 6 years and now all of a sudden I'm stalking her and threatening her?
If anything she is stalking me! How did she know I moved back? And how did she know that her boyfriends friend was the brother of my girlfriend? Does she keep tabs on everyone I date?
Her newest thing is telling everyone that she has a restraining order against me. Which is provably wrong, I never gave her any reason to get one, I've never been served with one, and I've gotten employment background checks that include restraining orders. All clean.
So basically now I can't go anywhere, I don't want to go to the movies, or the downtown area, or to popular restaurants or places that I remember her liking.
i don't put TOO much Value on the death threat thing, even though her father owns about 12 guns, including an assault rifle. My major concern is escalating this further, all I need is for her to see me somewhere in public and then tell her little army that I am stalking her.
I've considered trying to settle this in court, possibly getting a restraining order against her. But it seem like every time I try to defend myself I look like I'm guilty and I'm just shifting blame to the ""victim""",OneY

How to see males in a different light?,"And not in all the same light.

Will try to keep it quick (update: I failed): Have attended an all-female school most of my life, no brothers. I do have a few close male friends out of school, but out of the 7 (platonic or otherwise) relationships I've had with men over the last 3 years, 2 of them ended with an unwanted sexual experience, one of them being rather recent. I find it hard to comprehend that I could ever develop a genuine relationship with a man (unfairly dismissing the relationships I have already that seem perfectly healthy). I find myself second-guessing all interactions with men, regardless of how close I am to them, and making unfair assumptions about men who I just meet. Any sort of similarity I see between one male and another I just stupidly take it as validation that I could be right in my thinking. 

I'm attending a co-ed college after this summer and am working on changing this view. I've spoken to a few female friends about it but it doesn't help much. 

Talking to guys who have similar interests/concerns/opinions (not gender-related things) helps me break down my ""you're one of them, I'm one of these"" mentality. Hearing men and their point of view on anything helps to be honest. Now I'd like to try to understand if it's not completely one-sided. Do some of you experience things similar? Do you find yourself making assumptions about females, either women you've known for a long time or people you're just meeting? Is this because of past experience or otherwise? I've seen a lot of posts and news around about people stereotyping/assuming/sexism but almost none of women talking themselves of why/how they automatically see men differently and vise versa. Do you also feel you could never have a relationship with a female the way you would with a male? Anything you know/could say that would help lead me to a more fair way of thinking?

"Dear custodial dads, your participation in this study is greatly appreciated! [Approved by mods]","This research is being conducted by Gavin Duarte, a Graduate Diploma of Psychology student, under the supervision of Dr. Denise Corboy at Federation University Australia, and has been approved by the university’s Human Research Ethics Committee.

The current study defines primary custodial fathers as men who have acquired primary custody of their children following separation, divorce or in an extreme case, the death of the child/ren’s biological mother. The study will explore the variables that might affect the psychological well-being of primary custodial fathers, including traditional masculinity beliefs, skills and self-efficacy, and social support. It is hoped that this research will advance our understanding of fathers as primary custodians following a separation, and also offer additional insight for men approaching parenthood as a primary custodian.

Although this study was originally based on Australian fathers, fathers from all around the world are welcome to participate as every response is meaningful and appreciated.

-------------------

Criteria: Regardless of your current relationship status; If you have full, majority or shared custody of children under the age of 18 and have 10 minutes to spare.

------------

If you know anyone who matches this criteria and is willing to participate, or if you yourself would like to volunteer to participate in this research, which consists of an anonymous online questionnaire. Please take note or click on the link below to enter the survey for more information.
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WellbeingofAustralianPCFathers

-----------

The questionnaire will ask for demographic information such as age, relationship status, approximate income, place of residence and questions relating to the age and number of your dependants. Other questions will ask about your confidence and skills as a parent, how much social support you receive from friends and family, and questions about your current psychological well-being. Some of the questions also address concepts that have been associated with traditional masculine ideals, and will therefore ask about your attitudes towards women (e.g., “a man should always be the boss”), sexual behaviours and attitudes towards homosexuality.

Participants who successfully submit the questionnaire will have the opportunity to enter a prize draw to win one of three $30 gift vouchers as a token of thanks for participation.

Bad Date Ideas,,OneY
Why do people assume so many things about male virgins/celibates?,"&gt; A.k.a why do so many people assume incels or virgins are misogynists? 

Personally in my case, I have great friendships with many women. I just don't know how to flirt or get sexual and my lack of skill deters me from trying. I am attractive, educated, polite and well read, but I cannot talk ""sexy"" to woman and I never try. In an year, I haven't asked a single girl out. That's why I don't get sex and I am an incel. You know like people who don't know how to swim will hesitate trying to swim even in a shallow pool. Just like that. 

Not because I am a woman hater. 

&gt;Why is it okay to laugh at us?

Sitcoms, most reddit threads, everywhere we are the butt of jokes. As if we are invisible and have no emotions. Nobody would laugh at female virgins or call them ugly or unwanted or scum of earth.

But we are treated like subhuman aliens who are invisible. We not only lack any sort of support structure (friends/family , because we hide it from everyone and make up stories), we are also mocked by the same people. Even my worse looking friends who get laid a lot laugh at me saying ""jerk off"".  

When Elliot Rodgers happened, all the progressive media went on bashing us, all the incels or virgins. The same people who say we should not generalize muslims  based on terrorist attacks ran long  articles about how we are [terrorists](http://www.salon.com/2014/05/27/inside_the_terrifying_twisted_online_world_of_involuntary_celibates/) because no women let us put our dick in them. 

Anyways, I am sorry I dont speak for all sexless men. But I know this hurts a lot and it's ultimate helplessness. Not only am I regretting losing my best years due to repressed upbringing and shyness, but also has to take constant hit on my self worth when I read the way people (men and women) talk about us. I'll admit it though, as a straight man, I think women can never understand how much it sucks. 

Anyways, just wanted to vent.

Stood up to my ex today. Still a little shaky. Whoo.,"All right, big day for me.  First post here.  My grammar seems to be off.  Sorry. 

My ex (emotionally abusive during and after marriage) emailed in the morning saying she wanted to talk about something, so I asked what and she wouldn't answer.  I told her if she didn't say what it was about, I wouldn't be there.  She emailed back saying it would be about day camps and other stuff.  We have kids together, otherwise I would have front-paid all the alimony and said ""well... bye"".  

When I got there, her mom invited me in, but I said ""no, this won't take long.  We can use the carport.  They tried to get me to go inside because the kids would hear, but I said ""no, we can just keep our voices down"".  I'd got a text from someone and was putting my phone away just before she started, and she was asking me if I was recording.  (I wasn't.)  

She started yelling about how the kids shouldn't be left on their own (they're old enough to both be left alone and babysit other kids) while I kept my cool.  She wanted to yell and rant, but I said ""okay, I'll get my parents to come by in the morning.  You explain to [older kid] that you think she can't babysit.  What else do you want?""  

Her response was that she didn't trust me to do that, and wanted to keep ranting.  Then she asked me to agree to something really weirdly specific, and I called her out on that.  

I then said, ""okay, we're done with that, and you don't have to yell.  What's the other thing?""  

""I'm not done with that.""

""I am.  We're done here.  Email me about the other thing if it's important.""

Her mom then came out to tell me off.  I said, ""I have no comment for either of you.""  I don't know what I was trying to say, but not quite that.

I'm of two minds on the new ghostbusters movie....hoping I can discuss it here.,"So I didn't know where to put this so hopefully I can discuss it here.

First I grew up on ghostbusters. I was Egon for halloween when I was 4 and 24. It's the one movie I can watch anytime, anywhere, in any mood and still genuinely laugh at all the jokes because it's so damn good. It's also something I looked up to growing up. A movie about 4 blue collar guys who used science to take on literal gods and kicked their ass. Everyone was a fully developed character even Winston. 

Second, obviously, I'm a big big feminist/egalitarian. Everyone should be equal and shit sucks for both sexes in their own special way. Women get their own special shit flung at them and men get theirs. One big way I feel to help that is to better portray them in popular media. For example Overwatch has an awesome array of female characters. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is damn funny and has a lot of depth. That being said dudes are also getting better more 3d roles I.E. Geralt from Witcher and Tenzin from legend of Korra.

Third when I heard about the new Ghostbuster getting a new cast I was all for it. New story in that same universe lets do it. Then it was going to be female. Ok cool that's awesome brand new story and cast lets do this. Then. Then the trailer hit. It wasn't that it was bad. It's that it was the same as every other summer lowest common denominator comedy. Which not only betrayed the spirit of the franchise but the actresses that were in it. Like if you're going to make ""female ghostbusters"", run with that and bang that feminism drum then why not make sure they're good, believable people with depth? Why do you have to hire a hot guy because he's hot even though he's dumb as shit and you make it a point to show that, several times, in the movie? There are just so many plot threads that just get dropped in the 3rd act that I don't know what to make of this thing.

But then...then I see the posts from women. Women I respect and look up to saying things like ""girls need this movie because when I was a kid and we played ninja turtles I was always April"". For some reason that quote hit me hard. Like I took for granted that I got to play Batman, or Egon, or Leonardo or whatever I chose because they're guys and I'm a guy. Girls didn't. They never got to be the heroes. 

So I kinda don't know what to do. Like the movie is not good. Worse it's bland. It's just another summer comedy, a reboot too which leaves a bad taste in my mouth to begin with. But then I think of the girls that are looking up to this movie and thinking ""I can be that"" or whoever they want to be. That is sorely sorely needed in our geek culture. Can anyone help me work through this? I know it doesn't matter and it's just a movie but, it's Ghostbusters.",OneY

"Why do we just accept that men go bad? (Also, a rant on male beauty)","BALD*

Hi, I've just made this account and I've never posted on reddit before, so please excuse any failures of etiquette on my part. 

I don't really know how to approach this, for fear of being labelled as vain or, god forbid, non-masculine, but I'll give it my best go.

I am a 25 year old white male who has always had extremely thick and full auburn hair: to the point where there have been a few occasions where total strangers (men,women and groups of both) approach me in clubs/bars and ask to run their hands through my hair.

For a long time, I took this for granted, I only really took notice of these memories when I noticed one fateful morning a couple of years ago that my hairline had changed a bit. Not majorly: I wasn't going bald any time soon, but it had changed from the flawless arch that it was previously.

As stupid as it sounds, this opened my eyes to all the other guys around me, and the vast majority of them over 20 had some plight with hairloss. I consider myself observant (I'm a mathematician), so when I say hairloss, I don't mean they were losing their hair, I just mean that their are clear kinks and 'imperfections' in a large proportion of every &gt;20 guy's hair that I see. However, I have never really seen a male child without perfectly formed hair. So, I can only summise that at some point a male's hair is destined to change. 

And now, at 25, of course, I'm convinced I'll enter into my 30s with steadily declining hair. I hope I'm wrong, but If I'm being honest, this sometimes keeps me up a little more than it should at night.

I need to induce this point before I continue:

I know that women are the fairer sex, but I, as a man, will admit that I like to feel beautiful. I use the word beautiful rather than 'handsome' intentionally, despite its feminine connotations because to be beautiful is almost to be in harmony with the natural world; a sunset, a wolf, a flower - cheesy as fuck, but that's the mentality. This is opposed to just handsome, which to me is 'sexually desirable to women'. I of course, care about being desirable too, but the point I am trying to make is that I want to feel beautiful for me, which I think is something you hear women talk about a lot with regard to things like wearing make-up, and I really understand this. 

I'm not particularly metrosexual: I don't usually even do anything with my hair in the morning, but I do keep my armpit and pubic hair trimmed to some extent as a personal choice, but this is a once a week thing, that takes up maybe 20-30 minutes of my time. Beyond that, I just dress well. 

Now, with regard to the bald thing: I just wanted to know how others feel about this. To me, my hair is a part of my identity. I was born with my hair, and it's something I use to feel... elegant, in a way. Am I wrong to feel like I have a right to my hair? Not even just 'some hair'... Ideally, the hair I was born with, like most women get to have.   

Am I strange for letting the idea of this possibility toll on me so heavily? 

I know that if this fear were ever to become a reality, that I would, as they say, 'man up and shave it', because I am not going to fuck with my natural hormones and take the risks (however tiny) involved with those hair-maintaining drugs, in order to flail and grasp  - just as a matter of principle. Instead, I will have to let go of my hair, and put on a stern face, until I'm old enough or defeated enough to truly not care any more.

It is socially acceptable for a man to go bald. I pity even more a woman who goes bald, as I imagine she would constantly be assumed to be on chemo or something. But the fact is that it's so common for men - why isn't it more of a pressing issue, and why do so many people make fun of bald men? Am I unique in my wanting to feel beautiful? It's heartbreaking. 

One moment I was 19, and people would tell me I was pretty/gorgeous and more importantly, I felt it. I wasn't an asshole about it, I respected women and other men, and I remained the shy country boy and didn't let the compliments change my mentality. Now, six years later, and I'm here decaying.

EDIT: I read online somewhere that balding men’s hair follicles aren’t dead, they just progressively get tinier and tinier (more constricted) to a point. Why the fuck can’t some hero figure just make a damn shampoo that stops this and/or unconstricts them? :/

"It gets better. I'm (22M) back and glad to be rid of a toxic, abusive ex (20F). Better days are coming :) UPDATE","I was in an abusive relationship for 8 months. I was friends with her for 5 months before asking her out as we seemed to work well as friends. When we went out however, she started showing her jealous side/insecurities. In the past, she was cheated on and forced to do sexual acts by her exes. Throughout our relationship, I did everything I could to make her happy. However, she started saying I was like them, despite me never doing anything to hurt her.



When she got angry she was cruel, she hit me in the face with a shovel and yelled at me after because I swore at her (a natural response I thought). She hit me on two other occasions. If I told her something in confidence, she'd use it against me and twist my words. Once she caught on what she was doing, she would say that I was manipulating her.



She was also a selfish lover. She also was incredibly jealous whenever I talked to any of my female friends. This was so much the case that I deleted many of my female friends on Facebook/cut them out of my life. She could have as many guy friends, even guys she'd previously been with (she hid that until I asked her when we were drunk). I would've been fine with it, but she hid it, which was quite suspicious. But if I even talked to another woman she'd freak out and say she doesn't trust me with them. She tried to isolate me and she succeeded. Whenever we had a fight, she would confide in our mutual friends (who ended up being toxic people to me). However, at any hint of me trying to talk to a close friend or family member, she'd freak out. I usually wanted to talk about our issues privately but she never seemed to respect that. She would complain to them about something I did (untrue) but I was targeted by them, even one of her friends threatened to get a gang of people to beat me up.





However, she was a hypocrite and relished in double standards. She'd say I wouldn't pay for anything,(I paid for everything) , is that right? I know I'm a man but it didn't feel right. She hung out with guys she'd previously been with, and only confessed when she was drunk. If I hung out with people I'd been with before, she'd hate it. Another double standard. She cheated on me with 2 guys on a night out. One made out, and she woke up in one of their beds without any pants. She told our ""friends"" and they said to keep it secret from me. She told me anyway and came to me crying saying sorry etc.





I stayed with her as my nan was dying and I thought to not make a rash decision because of my emotional state (bad call). I asked her why she was still friends with one of the guys she cheated on me with, she said that if she deleted him, ""It would feel too real"". She was the one worried I would cheat, yet she was the one who did it. We broke up 6 months ago. I'm glad she's out of my life, I just wish I'd left her sooner. I felt weak as I'm a man being abused mentally and physically by a woman.
I'm sticking with family and friends and I'm so much happier for it! I'd like to be with a woman who sees me as an equal.






 I realised my last relationship was unhealthy, toxic and abusive. I've cut contact wth her and that group of people. This is a really important message, it gets better. There are shitty people out there but there are also wonderful people too. Stick with the latter. :) I'll be more careful next time and find someone who's the complete opposite of her. Someone kind, generous and loyal.
I'm a stronger person now after getting out of this on the other side. Abuse is never okay, no matter what gender. I should have realised that sooner.





UPDATE




I posted this on Facebook a month ago. A mutual friend must have shown it to her because I got a call from her mom threatening me to take it down within 24 hours. She said it was slander. I posted it, telling people that it does get better. I didn't mention her name or anything like that. It's also the truth. I just didn't want to have to deal with her, the lies she told her faily. They're rich and they could probably beat me in court. I took it down as soon as I got home, I was so scared. Still she's hurting me! Everytime I think she can't be a shittier person, she shows it again and again.




She posted an article for a website the same day about how 'Relationships Ruin Youth' and how bad abusive relationships are. I felt physically sick. How could I have loved  (or even liked) such a repulsive individual?



I just have to avoid people like her. It does get better.




TL;DR; Had abusive girlfriend for 8 months. Toxic friend group. I cut them out of my life. Happier now.

Boys Adrift by Leonard Sax,"I picked [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Boys-Adrift-Epidemic-Unmotivated-Underachieving/dp/0465072100/) up from my library recently.  While there are a number of factors Dr. Sax points to as to why boys are unmotivated and ""failing to launch,"" chapter 7 (The Fifth Factor) struck home for me.  He notes that we don't have traditional notions of what a manly man is any more.  He points to how Orthodox Jews and Navajo Indians have enduring cultures (although they have their faults, too), which emphasize manliness being more than just being ""a man"" with initiation rituals, tests, etc.  

He notes that The USA used to have role models of wise patriarchs on TV, such as My Three Sons and Father Knows Best (before my time), but now the only father figures are bumbling idiots (he mentions Homer Simpson).  When kids were told to ""grow up,"" they knew what it meant - versus now, when a kid does not know who he's supposed to act like.  We have no images of what a ""real man"" is in today's society - he points to The Hustler, Rebel Without a Cause, and On the Waterfront as movies where immature, cocky boys mature into men by overcoming various trials.  However, we don't have believable stories about boys becoming a heroic man set in our era, and we have to go in to science fiction or fantasy to find such heroes - Star Wars, Harry Potter, and LOTR.  

In the next chapter, Dr. Sax talks about the story of Josh Chamberlain, a Union Colonel who held an important hill at little round top.  Later on, Chamberlain salutes the Confederates as they surrender.  Chamberlain's story to Sax is important because his deeds were relatable (unlike Washington, whose burdens were too astronomical for most to relate to), and because his deeds were because of his background as a scholar, not a warmonger.

Has anyone else read this book?  What can we do to provide better role models?  Do any of you have a boy-specific area of life you help out with?",OneY

COPS and domestic violence,"I was watching COPS and a man was being arrested for slapping his wife on her jaw or something.

The police bring him to the car and talk to the wife.

Is it normal to have SO MANY things wrong with your body?,"I realized if I tally up the things wrong with my body, there are A LOT of them. I don't mean this in an ""I'm insecure about how I look"" way, I would just like to know if this is normal or not. Maybe there is some bigger issue screwing up everything and just making my body go bad in general? Here's a list of the main stuff:

Eyes:

- Very bad vision (had lasik to fix, so it's alright now).

Hair:

- Dandruff (doesn't matter how much dandruff shampoo I use).

- Can't grow facial hair (I'm 26, so this probably won't be changing).

Skin:

- Very bad eczema.

- Always very dry.

- Acne. 

- (All 3 things are bad enough to where my dermatologist basically said they are untreatable (they are so intense that I'd have to use steroids practically every day, but doing that is bad for you so you aren't supposed to do it.)

Penis:

- Frenulum breve (difficult to have sex, also just looks bad).

- Big curve to side (also makes sex difficult, and looks bad).

- (I've read both things can be fixed with surgery, but the surgeries would be too expensive (I live in the US, and my insurance deductible is $6,000 so insurance wouldn't cover it, plus I think it counts as cosmetic anyway), and a lot of people who got the surgeries say they just made things worse anyway, so not sure what to do.)

Random stuff:

- Tons of food allergies and intolerances (I end up going to the bathroom for a #2 3 times a day because I'm intolerant to so many things that it's virtually impossible to avoid eating them at some point during the day).

- Very short - 5'4"" (not a big deal, just throwing this in here to bring the total list of things to 10).

I really don't want to sound like I'm complaining, and I'm not looking for patronizing replies. Most of these things aren't a big deal to me, but some of them do interfere with my life (ex. bad skin and messed up penis). 

So I was just wondering if it's pretty normal for people to have so many things wrong with their bodies, or if this is unusual? None of my friends have any of these issues so I've always just assumed that I drew the short stick in the genetic lottery and most guys have no real problems with their bodies. ",OneY
"Welp, I'm finally ready to move on.","Fist time here.

So it's been about 6 months since my ex and I broke up. She was my first girlfriend, and we went pretty fast. I didn't think it was a big deal since we'd known each other for a few years. Things were going well for while, and then everything started going downhill. And when it started going downhill... it never stopped. It got to the point where every single conversation we had ended in an argument and somehow I was the one that needed to change everything. I mean, I'm by no means perfect, but neither was she. 

When the breakup happened, she called me when I was in Walmart and blamed everything on me. Literally everything. The only area where she said she could've done better was that she couldn't be with someone who didn't communicate (even though I did, but she thought I was wrong so she didn't hear it). A lot of hurtful things were said that day.

Now I've been used and lead on by so many girls over the years, I was basically done with dating. Just happy to hang out with the guys and stay out of trouble. But last night I did something. Many will see it as meaningless and silly, but it meant something to me. I changed my relationship status on Facebook from blank, to single. Now I'm hardly on Facebook, but this was a sort of public statement that I'm ready to find something new. I'm tired of bring afraid of putting myself out there. I'm tired of thinking less of myself because of what was said to me and what my mind does when I get alone with myself. I'm happy with myself while I'm single, but I think that's a good thing. I don't need a woman in my life, but I would like to have someone who compliments my strengths and helps compensate for my weaknesses. I want to become a better man and a woman can and will push me and grow me. And I know have some good things to offer, I just need to find that one person willing to take the time and effort to mesh together.",OneY

Late 20s; masturbated for the first time; can't stop thinking about sex now. Help!,"Not sure this is the right place to post this, but it seems as good as any, and I'm starting to get desperate.

(half-confessional, half-request for support. Thanks for reading!)

I'm a single guy in my late 20s. I belong to a church that teaches that porn and masturbation are wrong. I'm not interested in discussing that position, but it's necceasary context. In either case, I have never masturbated before--until this week.

On monday, I sort-of accidentally masturbated for the first time. Sparing as many details as possible, I was dozing off--right where you start to lose self-control--and slipped my hand *down there.* next thing I know, I'm snapping awake just in time for the last stroke. And I did something similar the next night--I tried a ""move"", and was gonna leave it at that, but I set myself off again (apparently I have an ""endurance"" of about 10 seconds... The wedding night's gonna be *fun* for Future Mrs. TA...)

In the days since, I can't stop thinking about sex and masturbation, to the point where it's overwhelming. Like, thinking about rubbing one out in the bathroom at work, on the train coming home, that sort of thing, sometimes so powerfully it makes me physically nauseous. And last night, playing games with friends online, out of nowhere I got hit with a wave of powerful, physical *need* so strong I literally couldn't think straight.

As I'm sure you can understand, this is deeply disturbing to me.

I know the ""correct"" thing to do is probably ""keep jerkin' it until hormones normalize,"" but, as I said, that's not an option; say what you will about my beliefs, but I made a commitment to stick to them, and I don't want to cross that line any more than I already have. My present plan is to wait it out, and allow whatever dust I've kicked up to settle--but in the meantime, it's still deeply unpleasant.

So, any advice for me? Anything I can/should do to bring down these urges? And, is this sort of hormone(?) spike normal for this sort of thing?

SO and I are finally able to be physically intimate after 1.5 years of healing.,"With a lot of practice, and talking, we are phasing our way back into being sexually and romantically intimate with each other.
We started dating about 2 years ago, and we were physical at first, but only because she thought that's what you have to do in a relationship (thanks to her past boyfriend who was both sexually and emotionally abusive.)
After the PTSD and other affects of the abuse started to come to surface, she talked to me and we stopped immediately, as it was clearly not something she truly enjoyed or really even wanted. The relationship came a very intellectual and emotional relationship, which allowed us to grow and bond as best friends and partners, but lacked the physical side. Until now!

I am so proud of her. She's worked so hard in counseling, and talking with me about her thoughts. And I just needed to share, because though being physical isn't the most important thing (at least for me), it's definitely something I need to feel completely loved. Additionally, cuddling and hugging her makes me feel manly.

My SO isn't on Reddit, but I just wanted to share a story. She is such a kind and beautiful person, and I am happy I can now hug her without her feeling disgusting or gross.

My boyfriend's favourite sex position is my worst.,"I am fully aware, that my boyfriend loves 'girl on top'. He has told me it is favourite position before, he's said how amazing it is and how sexy it is. I have done it before, of course, but I really really hate it. 
Just under a year ago now, I was raped, three times, separate occasions.  My boyfriend is fully aware of this, and we had already been dating for a year. He was very supportive, and at the time I felt so immune to the rape, 'emotionally switched off' I've learnt is a better term for it. But gradually this past year the emotion has been coming out of me more and more, and I'm really feeling the effects of it now. During the rape, a certain position that sticks in my mind so much was me on top. It has stayed so vivid in my memory because of the fact that I was on top. The abuser told me I loved it, I was the one in control, therefore it wasn't rape. And I do feel like he's brainwashed me. But the truth is I felt so paralysed under his control and as if I wasn't even in my body. Anything he told me to do, I did it, at first, trying to protect myself, then I gave up and let it happen. Because I felt like I had no control over my body. However with him telling me that 'I loved it' makes me feel SO guilty, and I just HATE that position so so much! 

Unfortunately this is my boyfriend's favourite position. I feel bad for not being able to please him completely. He does briefly know why I don't want to be in this position, as I said 'it brings back bad memories'. But I haven't explicitly told him (or anyone) like I just have everyone who reads this. I also don't really feel comfortable telling him, as I don't think I could ever say these words out loud. It's been hard to type them. 

My boyfriend doesn't 'go on' about his favourite position, but I just asked him tonight curiously about sex and he said that girl on top was definitely his favourite, and this made me feel quite shit and guilty for not doing it. 

Typing all this out has already helped me. Sorry if this is posted in the wrong place. New to Reddit. I'm just looking for some kind of advice, or any kind of opinion anyone has, whether I should just get over it or what.

Stanford Rape Case,"First off, I'm sorry if this comes off as insensitive or deliberately only trying to see the man's side of a conflict. I just didn't understand this case.

Facts of the case as I understand them:
Two passing graduate students see a man humping an unconscious woman lying on the ground lying behind a dumpster, chase him off, and tackle him. The man claims the sex was consensual, and that the woman passed out during sex. The woman has no recollection of the incident.

So... I just don't understand. Is the issue that it *is* actually rape to continue having sex with a consenting partner after they pass out (stay inside more than x seconds and you're a rapist?), or that we think he's lying about it being consensual, or that he got her drunk to have sex with her, or that its rape to have sex with an intoxicated woman, or the fact that he ran off implies knowledge it wasn't consensual, or that its unlikely a girl would have consented to have sex behind a dumpster, or...?",OneY

Killing the violent side of your personality,"When I was growing up I was exposed to violence In a number of ways, mainly through my older brothers actions and interests. From primary school through to the end of high school I'd be fighting with my older brother, very often it would be instigated by him and incredibly one sided. I'd get into fights at school, on the footy field, at the pubs. After my brother was beaten in a disgusting way about 8 years ago my perception of violence completely changed and since then I have avoided it as much as I can. I was wondering if this exposure to physical violence is a common thing among young men, and what/how has your views on physical violence changed as age.",OneY
"Why do discussions about masculinity, male role models, etc. turn into discussions about women?","I was watching TED Talks and while most of the videos under the category gender are about women and feminism I found one titled [How movies teach manhood](https://www.ted.com/talks/colin_stokes_how_movies_teach_manhood). I was into it until if felt like the presenter focused more about how girls are affected by movies than boys, and the way he talked about how it affects boys was in the context of how they are taught to treat girls. I don't disagree with what he said but I was still disappointed that he didn't actually talk about the subject in the title.

I got a little too excited when I saw this article: [Transgender Men See Sexism From Both Sides - Time](http://time.com/transgender-men-sexism/) and while it touched a little on what it's really like to be a man vs a woman in society it was more about how women are treated in society. Again I'm not disagreeing with what was in the article but it didn't go in the direction I was hoping.

It doesn't happen all the time but it's common enough to be noticeable and honestly a little frustrating. It feels like any article or what have you that talks about men in culture (which are rare to begin with) will either:

* Be about how men need to support/respect women
* Make fun of, parody or admonish men about something.
* Reinforce traditional male gender roles/make fun of men for breaking them

We're only relevant if we're a punchline or if women/feminism are involved. The alternative is conservatives ranting about the ""feminization"" of men. Healthy analyses of manhood in modern society are few and far between.

How likely is it that just grabbing a girl and kissing her will work favorably?,"So there's this girl Im've been flirting with and she seems pretty interested in me too but I never seem to get the opportunity to make a move on her.

Man Slandering - Slandering Men One Term at a Time,"**Mansplaining**

**Manterupting**

**Manbaby**

**Mangry**

The list of bigoted and sexist terms used to denigrate and slander men knows no limit. The practice generally consists of taking a word for a common human trait which is prevalent to both genders, slap the word man in front of it and then use the resulting term to denigrate, shame and slander men. And let's be blunt here - these terms are not being used in anything resembling a constructive dialog with men. The terms are most commonly used in ""circle jerk"" discussions or in poorly written pseudo-intellectual articles written in condescending tones and lacking any empirical evidence. This [trash](http://shrinktheweb.snapito.io/v2/webshot/spu-ea68c8-ogi2-3cwn3bmfojjlb56e?size=800x0&amp;screen=1024x768&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feverydayfeminism.com%2F2015%2F11%2Ftypes-of-misogynistic-men%2F) is an example.

Why does this bigotry exist? Why do these people hate us men so much? Why do we men tolerate this hatred?

Why not words like:

**Mancourage**

**Mangenius**

**Mansuffering**

**Mantalent**

It speakers volumes that these bigots only combine negative terms with the word man. I've never heard these people ever use the term **Manpower**.

Is it just me or is dating so damn stressful?,"I am super tired- not of the rejection or being single, but dating itself. 

From the moment I meet a girl, ask her out, to paying for the food after the date, it's more stressful than my work. 

I have to initiate the conversation, impress her, then pick place, time that works for both of us (mind you my work is so tolling some days I just get home and pass out) , driving, paying for the food, taking her back home/her car. 

She can just sit here, choose to take part in the whole process or not. She can laugh at my jokes, while I like a performer has to make here laugh. If anything fails, my friends would probably laugh at me, her friends would probably laugh at me. 

Even if it goes to the next phase, the pay off is still too much for just not being lonely. 

May be I am meeting the wrong women. I know many of you would say that may be theyre not attracted to me, but I promise you some of the times, it's the girl who indirectly asks me out and even text me after the first date while I dont want to see her again. 


Being a n introvert and having to build a charismatic confident shell in itself is tiring to me. 

If I could get past the initial ""dating"" phase and get to the knowing each other part that would be great.

Bathroom Etiquette - Two Stall Land,"So I have always been of the opinion that in a two stall bathroom, if somebody else is ""doing work"" then you should leave and wait for the room to clear(exceptions in case of emergencies).  Nobody wants to poop when someone else is next door. A lot of the other dudes in my office do not subscribe to the same rules as me, as proved on an almost daily basis of interruption.

It’s less common than in women, but men have a much higher mortality rate because the lack of awareness around male breast cancer means they and their doctors often don’t recognize their risk until the cancer has progressed.

To what extent do women’s romantic preferences hold men back in the modern era?,"Topic.

Also, inb4: not all men, not all women, not our entire lives, etc. I'm more concerned with structural trends during formative years rather than specific cases.

For many guys in their 20s or 30s that I know, there's a distinction between who you'd like to be as a person, and the style of mask you wear to increase your attractiveness with the opposite sex.

It's the 'nice guy' problem -- a non-transactional, non-objectifying, emotionally warm, socially intelligent guy is confused why none of his female friends (or women he meets) have any romantic interest in him.

Now that it's college graduation season, I've been thinking about this a lot more. To what extent does this effect affect the propensity of young men to aspire to do well in school, and go to college? To be willing to be seen as someone who reads books for fun, or to join a gang or play sports?

While there are a lot of bad things about romance that adversely affect women (absurd emphasis on physical attractiveness -- does it freak anyone else out that women in the 21st century still wear make-up?!), I feel like the character traits that would make a good 21st century female knowledge worker are not at odds with the traits that make one a romantically attractive female. But with men... they seem quite a bit at odds.

Should I keep my girlfriend?,"Alright. I've been pondering on this for the last few months, and I figured some anonymous opinions can't hurt. I'll try to give you guys as much detail as necessary to make an informed opinion on the subject. 

**Basic info**

We're both 22 years old, and we met when we were 18, so 4 year anniversary is coming up pretty soon. Back then I was an introvert, my life mainly consisting of gaming and work, and I lived in a basement with my friend. I guess you can imagine how the place looked and everything. Our social lives were entirely online, and in retrospect I can understand why a lot of people would call us both losers. Now, however, I've transformed into a different person. While not outgoing, I'm able to handle smalltalk and conversations without making it awkward, and I can generally keep talking to people through various techniques to avoid the conversation stagnating. This obviously has a load of benefits, which I'll get into in a bit. 

**I'll give you the positives first:**

My girlfriend is the most intelectually stimulating person I've ever met. Even though we disagree about a lot of things, she's really good at keeping discussions professional, and always strives to see both sides of an argument before she gives her opinion. When we disagree we keep it civil, with a notable exception; when we're fighting. Secondly, she's also extremely supportive, so whenever I have issues with anything, she will be there to give advice and cheer me on. I believe she genuinely cares for me, and wants to help me be the best possible version of myself. Furthermore, she's really good with personal finance, something I really really suck at. I make about 80K USD a year, and without her I would blow it all on random things that I don't even need. Thanks to her I have a house now, just to give you an idea of the magnitude of her assistance in this field. All of this has made me into a better person, although it's hard to say what would've become of me had I not met her.

**Now onto the negatives:**

She's also extremely jealous, to the point where I caught her getting up in the middle of the night to check my facebook conversations and text messages. She didn't find anything really incriminating, but she would confront me about conversations I had with girls that I was gaming with at the time (nothing really to be upset about, just random banter about such and such, they were all from different countries). I found this to be a severe violation of my trust, and I struggled for a while after that trusting her. Additionally, she's not really a looker. Back when I met her, I was so desperate for affection I pretty much went for the first woman that I felt I had a chance of getting, and you could say I struck gold, however there are a lot of features about her looks that I don't particularly enjoy. After learing to socialize, I feel like I could do much better in the looks department. Lastly, she sex is just not that great. Even after 4 years, I consistently struggle with finishing because she just doesn't arouse me anymore. I can make her come no problem, as by now I know how to.  I've tried to teach her how to do blowjobs/handjobs, but as some of you may know it's not that easy to teach, at least for me. I'll add that she's very willing to have sex whenever I initiate, and right now I'm actually the one with less desire for sex. 

**Now onto the actual issue:**

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about letting her go and moving on. I feel like I want to explore the world, the women in it, and gain some experiences, both good and bad, before settling down for good. I fear the thought of us hitting 50 and breaking up, only for me to realise I've blown my entire youth away. Because of the jealousy issues, travel is unecessarily stressful. Constant texting and attention are required to keep her from flipping out. In addition, she sometimes ""dreams"" that I've cheated and flips out completely when I'm gone, which takes weeks of reassurance and her going through my bank statements in order to clear my name. She's also being increasingly pushy about buying something together and having kids, and I just don't feel ready for such a commitment. I've told her this, and she understands, but I feel like the longer this goes on, the more impatient she'll get, and the more she'll want us to live together. (We did live together for a year, and it ended pretty badly due to differing expectations).

Here are some of the things I can't do because of my current situation:

* Go on a trip without a phone (Live in the moment type deal)
* Buy a hooker
* Have a one night stand
* Get laid on Tinder
* Have at least 1 other girlfriend, just to see what else is out there. 
* Be able to have female friends without being interrogated about it every time we interact. 
* Study for a year abroad.

For the record, I'm not fat or ugly, and I've missed out on countless experiences because I don't want to cheat on her, so finding other women would not be an issue. 

So to summarize; my girlfriend is really smart, caring, and loving, but is also jealous and super boring in bed. I have urges to get out there and see what the world has to offer, but I'm scared I'll never find someone better than her and end up alone in some cabin. 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts.

**edit/update**

I realise I made it sound like I've made up my mind already, but bottom line is I still love her character. 

There's also another issue here that's somewhat related. I grew up in an extremely religious environment, and so all my childhood friends were from there as well because we were not allowed to make friends at school. As we got older, one by one they all ""found Jesus"" and essentially cut all ties with ""outsiders"" (me) which means I lost my entire group of friends. She's the only close friend I have at the moment, and I guess that's a big reason why I'm having a hard time letting go. 

Just to be clear, I'm working very hard on making new friends, and I'm making progress, but it takes time. I feel like if I leave her, I will have nobody at all to talk to, because all my other friends are not close enough to really have those deep conversations with, and my parents are super religious as well which means I'm not getting any support due to me not being part of their club.",OneY

Is porn just the outsourcing of sex?,"In the modern world, I feel like sex is just another one of the industries outsourced by an advanced society. Most of us don't work in factories or farms anymore, we're isolated from the labor but get all the fruits of it. I feel porn is the same way. It is relatively consequence free when matched against the dangers and consequences of IRL sex. So why shouldn't the goal of a progressing civilization be to have a select few have sex for us, while we reap the benefits? With the advances of virtual reality, computer graphics, robotics, sex toys, etc. it is becoming more and more obvious that an outsourcing of sex is desired by a lot of people.

Now I am a virgin so I know that is coloring my judgment and I don't know how the orgasm of partnered sex compares to that of solo, but I can imagine a future where most relations between men and women are platonic and all sexual and reproductive needs are relegated to an outsourced industry be it with virtual or real sex workers.   

Basically, I'm interested in whether anyone views porn as progress above and away from sex. Whether porn could create a freer and more egalitarian society. Personally, I think it is easier to be friends/equals with someone you are not sexually/romantically interested in, so if we take that to its most extreme and say only a select few will have sex allowing the rest of us to interact on a higher level, this could lead to more peaceful, equal societies with less power struggles or divisions.

I know sex is a primal instinct and all, but I believe if a society viewed and treated sex as manual labor i.e. undesirable, then most would be able to adapt their sexual urges to the new ""zeitgeist"" and find release in the more ""refined"" channels of virtual sex, like replacing cigarettes with e-cigs.

  I am a fellow Redditor (I promise I am one of you, this is a throwaway account since so much of my personal information is connected to the survey process). I want to conduct this research with Redditor’s to create a better, diverse understanding of how young adults understand and give sexual consent. I have selected subreddits I think have interest in my research and research topic. If you can think of a fellow Redditor or another subReddit that would enjoy being part of this research please feel free to share the link.

  For any interested Redditors that are 18-24 years old and currently living in the US: Please help me create a more thorough understanding of how sexual consent is given and received in sexual interactions. I am completing my Master’s thesis by conducting an open-ended survey about the consent process in sexual interactions. Your time and willingness to share your experiences are greatly appreciated and will help contribute to a better understanding of how we give or receive sexual consent.

  Upon request, I can provide you with my IRB approval from MTSU. Responses will be used in my thesis, and direct quotes may be used in the results of the research. No identifiable information is being collected, and responses will be anonymous. Your confidentiality and anonymity is of great importance for me as a researcher. I encourage participants to be as open, honest and complete with their responses as they feel comfortable with.

  The survey starts with an informed consent page that details and explains all the necessary information about the research for you as the participant. There are a few demographic questions following the survey.

  There is no compensation for participating in the research other than my sincere gratitude and an opportunity to collaborate in exploring sexual consent as a social phenomenon. The anticipated risks for participants are minimal, and all efforts are being undertaken to minimize risk and discomfort for participants.

  I expect the survey to take approximately 30 to 60 minutes to complete. I have turned off the collection of IP and email addresses, so responses are completely anonymous and confidential. I also am allowing participants to go back and change responses if after completing the survey you want to add to or change a recollection or experience.

  Thank you in advance for collaborating with me on this research.

  The following is the link to the survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/GD3SGF9

  Trigger warning The questions are not intended to be triggering, but do ask personal questions of a sensitive nature about previous sexual experiences so there is list of resources for sexual assault survivors following the survey.

[2X M] How to deal with past sexual abuses?,"Originally posted on /r/MaleSupportNetwork and received some responses, I am just looking for some more feedbacks here.

How do/did you guys deal with your past abuses? It's pretty embarrassing to admit that I was abused sexually and/or physically a couple times especially since I'm a guy (I'm not trying to be sexist or anything...). I don't have a family to talk to because it's just me and my mom. My mom never stood up for me during both the times I was sexually abused by two different babysitters. All she did was talk to their parents about it and continued to let them take care of me, though there were no further instances of abuse. Still it makes me angry that I was under their care afterwards. There was another time where I went over to a fellow kid's house from the local day-care where he almost strangled me to death when I was alone with him in his room. I didn't bother telling my mom this time though. It's hard for me to be open or trusting towards in general because I'm unfamiliar with the idea of bonding, such as those among friends and family. It's always been just me and my mom in the family. My small circle of friends who were all from the same high school were a pretty normal group of guys- all with both parents and large families and financially stable. It's why I couldn't really open up to any of them and also because we were guys... One of my closer friends who also has a single parent and is an only child made me feel very uncomfortable due to some of his questionable actions towards me over the years after graduation, so I try not to stay in contact with him. I hate the thought of paying for therapy because well, they're complete strangers, I don't want to be a number, and I probably can't afford it. Just want some feedbacks on Reddit I guess.

Some other things to note: -was bullied in middle school -have social anxiety -is suicidal -can be optimistic if not stubbon -not good at taking initiative

A girl at my high school decided to spread the rumor that I'm a sexual predator.,"It's a long story, but I'll spare you the unnecessary details.

I'm a seventeen year old guy. I had a friend, and she was very liberal, whereas I'm much more conservative (in sexual regards).
One day she threatens to kill herself, and the next day she asks me out. I could hardly say no to a girl I thought was going to off herself upon rejection. That was my mistake.

In any case, a few days later, we’re sitting on a bench and she’s oddly uncomfortable and I’m not entirely certain why. Later that night she texts me that she was under the impression that I was going to make sexual advances on her because apparently my hand was very, very close to her crotch (I swear I was unaware of this). I told her I was sorry and that it wouldn’t happen again. I thought that was the end of it.

A few days later she breaks up with me, so I guess it was never a relationship at all, since it really was only like a week long. I’m fine with the break up, I wasn’t that interested to begin with.

That very night, her ex texts me, threatening to hurt me if I don’t stay away from her because I’m “a fucking rapist” and “I should realize when people don’t want my ugly ass”. I, being the dumbass that I am, instead of setting the record straight, replied with a sincere apology about what happened. I thought THAT was the end of it.

That night, apparently she had told him the story of the date on the bench – you know, the one where I “groped her and tried to force her to have sex with” me – to get pity sex from her ex. They hooked up, he texted me, and the next day at school he spreads the rumor as much as he could.

This was a few months ago... but it never ends. Every few days, new people text me angrily that they think I’m disgusting and end up blocking me and spreading the rumor further. The rumor it’s turned into now is “OP tried forcing girl to have sex, and when she wouldn’t listen, he tricked her into meeting him again and tried to rape her there (and I have no clue what this second meeting is about or how that became a part of the rumor). People reported me, counselors called my parents and I got into tons of trouble (I’m not allowed to date to begin with… my parents are fundamentalist to the point where if I so much as talk to a girl, they’ll shout and scream at me and punish me horribly, which sucks because 90% of my friends are female), and I’m losing friends by the dozen every few days. Even the people who know me as the religious, conservative, not-sexually-active-at-all good guy of their groups are taking her word over mine simply because so many people are spreading the rumor. School is almost over, and I know I should just suck it up and deal with it, but it still hurts a lot. People I don’t want to lose are leaving me for a rumor that has no basis whatsoever.

I guess this is a rant more than anything... does anyone have any advice for me? I don't know how to deal with a girl who spreads shit about me just to reap pity sex from random guys. I don't know why I'm the victim. Please help me understand my situation.",OneY

what are the virtues of being a man?,"Often people encourage women and go like hell yeah! you go girl! and what not, but now I myself feel like as a man I dont feel any support from just being a man. I love women no doubt but can you remind me of the virtues of being a man? I'm genuinely asking this and I think women deserve the world wide support. &lt;3",OneY

"[Relationships] 29M Seeking advice, any help would be appreciated","Apologies in advance for the text block and the throwaway.

I'm looking for advice on some relationship issues. Therapist and male friends aren't really an option for various reasons.

Basically, I'm struggling with monogamy and trying to figure out if it's my choice in women or just something inherent in my personality.

I've always been a ""relationship guy"", definitely more often with a partner than not since adulthood, like a 10:1 ratio. Not sure how I feel about that, but I do feel like my behavior is checked somewhat by a loving partner.

I often fall into relationships very quickly, full of infatuation and good intentions, get through the honeymoon phase, and kind of muddle forward for a couple years with varying degrees of success until I get so bored that I a) find an alternative route for sexual energy, whether that's lots of masturbation or infidelity, or b) break up with the lass. (Didn't say I was the hero of this story..) 

I feel like I'm a very sexual person, I love women, I love flirting, and I also love the comfort of being with someone long-term. I have pretty severe ADD, which may contribute somehow, and my family has been affected by infidelity on my dad's side.

I have also hurt really good friends by, while never sleeping with their current girlfriends technically, definitely pushing the bro-code way past its natural edge. I feel like shit afterward, but only when I get caught. I sometimes feel like a stupid kid that just wants what he wants, and fuck the consequences.

I'm currently with my partner of about a year, same circumstance of falling in quickly and cohabitating immediately, and now at the end of my rope of interest, bored, feeling shitty that I couldn't make this one work either, and intense insecurity on my partner's part (from way back), exacerbated by my obviously growing disinterest. I assure her I care a ton about her, and I do. But again, I don't see a future with her. I really wanted to make this one work.

I'm looking for advice, if anyone feels like they've shared some of the same problems. How you've dealt with them in your life, and if I just need to slap myself and/or live as a monk or a redpiller the rest of my life. I feel the high need for stimulation inherent in ADD is one of the causes.. Is polyamory the way to go or is it possible that would just be a band-aid fix for something deeper? 

Thanks for taking the time to read, I know my cloak isn't the cleanest but I'm trying to get serious about breaking unhealthy cycles.",OneY

Negative on STD tests but having penile discharge symptoms??,"Hi there!

So, about two months ago I started noticing a white, odorless penile discharge, happening every morning and in small quantities (happens also during the day, but rarely, and it's transparent, also odorless).

I imeddiately went to a doctor to get checked, and the tests turned out negative. He gave me antibiotics and a trichomoniasis remedy too. The symptoms then disappeared after 2 or 3 days and I tought nothing more of it.

Then about one month I started getting the same symptoms, went to the doctor and got checked again.
Negative for chlamydia, trichomoniasis and gonorrhea. Negative for other STDs also. The only thing that did show up was ""Gram Positive Bacteria"", present in the discharge during the mornings.

He then gave me the same meds, wich I haven't took yet.
What could I possibly have that is making this discharge??

Some info on me: I'm 20 yo, have an active sexual life with my girlfriend whom I've been together for ~7 months. 
I'm allergic to condoms, some kinds of soap and alot of other things. Doctor said that it could also be an allergic reaction, but I don't really think so. Also, my SO haven't took any meds.",OneY

"In this sub's opinion, does The Red Pill and associated ideals hurt men as much as women? Or are aspects a necessary evil?","Now of course NAWALT and NAFALT, but most people I have spoken to say 'The Red Pill hurts men AND women'; but when pushed, what they really mean by 'hurts men' is 'makes you an unpleasant asshole I disapprove of.' I garner from this that the emotional wellbeing of victims of TRP are not actually the concern of these people, but rather preventing angry disenfranchised men from becoming radicalised and a threat. I don't know about you, but this pisses me off. Why do men's needs only matter insofar as they either benefit the wellbeing of women and children? Why does a man's security only matter insofar as it guarantees the security of women and children? Even on this sub I saw a table linked which managed to turn '40% of young boys are harassed' into 'violence against women.' 

So I am coming here to ask; how do you feel that TRP and Red Pill beliefs hurt *men*? ",OneY
BallsBALM Male Hair Removal Where did it go?,"Anyone else use ballsBALM Bare Balm in the past? It has been one of the only things that clean up both sides real nice like.. And I buy it in pretty large quantities. My last purchase was about 5 months ago, and I'm down to my last bottle, but I can't seem to find it being sold anywhere. Their website is still up, but all the purchase links take me to Sold Out Amazon pages. :/ 

I fear to say I've become pretty reliant on it and almost need it now that I've used it for so long, as it is the only thing that not only actually clears up all the hair, but doesn't ever cause me burning or leave any rashes/ingrown hair during regrowth etc.

Anyone have any news on this? Or products they'd recommend if I have to use something else?",OneY

Men of OneY what are your experiences of 'everyday sexism' against men?,"An open letter by Conservative Member of Parliament (Canada) Michelle Rempel to the National Post http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/michelle-rempel-confront-your-sexism enjoins men to step up and fight against the 'everyday sexism' faced by women.

&gt;If you’ve ever interviewed someone for a job and thought, “I’m pretty sure her uterus still functions, she might have a baby and take maternity leave, so I’m going pick the guy instead,” that’s your sexism to deal with, not hers.

&gt;If you’ve ever held a woman back because you thought they were bossy, or aggressive, why is it her responsibility to tell you why that’s wrong?

&gt;If you’ve ever sung along to violent misogynistic lyrics, bought a girl a Barbie when they wanted the Meccano set, attributed a woman’s success to her sexual skills, cat-called a woman, assumed a pregnant woman wants her belly to be touched by you, stayed silent during a disgusting sexist joke, assumed your female partner was going to clean your house and make dinner because of traditional gender segregation of housework, stayed quiet while a friend is abusing a woman, or if you’ve abused a woman yourself, you’re the problem, not her.

I have a lot of problems with this letter not the least of which is that in itself the letter is sexist against men (she assumes these things or their equivalents only happen to women).

I thought it might be interesting for the men of OneY to talk about some of the ways that men face sexism everyday. For example, Rempel talks about assuming a women got her job because through her sexual skills. Any men ever feel dismissed because it was assumed they got the job because the looked good in a suit and had a penis? How about cops or firemen, do you have stories about people who only saw a guy looking good in uniform instead of the important work you do? Waiters want to chime in about what you face on the job? Anyone have a job where people treat you like you're stupid because you work with your hands?

"Complainant at Ghomeshi trial waives anonymity, says complainants need better guidelines","For those following the fall out from the Ghomeshi trial and its legal implications, there is a new development: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jian-ghomeshi-woman-waves-publication-ban-1.3540206

Analysis of the case by Canadian criminal lawyers as the trial was going on pointed to the way the complainants did not seem to understand the trial process in Canada. This complainant, her name is Linda Redgrave, seems to echo that sentiment. Perhaps too much of what we know in Canada about police work comes from watching US crime shows. 

I live in Canada and I am sorry to say I do not know much about how rape cases are handled here either. I recently watched a Netflix series (on Netflix Canada at least, I don't know about other places) called The Detectives about a sex crime investigation unit in Manchester, UK. It shows some of the difficulties of these cases. I was impressed by the way the British police handled it. The show, however, never mentioned that men and boys are also raped and never showed any cases where there might have been question of false accusations.",OneY
Update 1: Please make OneY default,"A few days back I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/4f4n0h/oney_as_default/) post on making OneY default. The answers seemed very resistant to change almost as if I had posted in an aggressive CMV.

-  If you are for the motion, please message the mods and please message me or comment here with why or just how you support the motion.


- If you are against the motion, please let me know in detail what in your opinion needs to be done before this can happen (I.E. different moderations tactics to twoX and a promise for the same with OneY-default).  I want to change your mind if you'll allow me. Let me give you an example.  Say a couple have trouble breastfeeding. Both male and female posts to twoxchromosomes or twox. Say it is a traditional problem of the wife not being able to breastfeed enough. I imagine that if a male posted, given the modern connotations, he would be told to ""back off"", ""give her time"" at best he would be told to order bottles or get another nurse/nanny involved. All these pieces of advice seem to have one goal in mind: Distance the father from his child. God forbid he breastfed with his nipples on a hairles  chest. Then even what if he just want to come to terms woth jealousy or generally being unable to help?
If the female would be posting, the advice would be to ;take a short break; excercise more and eat healthier;contact your nurse or birthmother; have your partner buy breastmilk; go to your doctor and check for infections; wear a different bra; take notes on when you are able to breastfeed. ..Of course this previous topic is a troll flame war waiting to happen. I am not asking you to pay attention to the topic of the example but rather the difference in amount and type of ""help"" emerging. 

Somehow posting in twox you get more advice that is sometimes ONLY helpful of you are a woman. Culturally or biologically. Now I have accumulated some knowledge I wish I was told when I was younger but my dad just disn't know or care or weren't allowed to be around. for instance: how pain in testicles can make you sterile in hours or how you hygienically best could clean your ballsack or that you hygienically speaking need to pee after sex to rinse oit potential infections.  I kind of wish a thread existed where male issues would get the same kind of care,deliberation and attention as a female topic. With the same average length of responses (wordcount) and non-distancing advice.



I believe for this to happen OneY needs to go default. It is not like ""oneofeachchromosome"" or similiar male subs with higher wordcount get attention.

I have messaged the mods and I hope to hear back from them with an empathic and goal oriented response.

Who do you guys *talk* to?,"I feel like as I've gotten older (23), I've kind of stopped knowing anyone that I can really relate to. I have an active social life, I talk to a lot of people, I have a lot of friends of both genders, and of many different ages and ethnicities. Almost all of my friends are either in graduate/professional school, or working (law/medical/science). From the outside I seem calm and happy, but I just don't feel like I relate to others very much.

I just feel like...

1) While I feel like my female friends can relate **to me,** and they are generally comfortable sharing intimate details about their lives and asking for my opinions or feedback, I generally don't feel like I relate **to them**, or can actually open up about things I think about.

2) I feel like everyone around me has gone through a continuous stream of successes in life. Did well in high school &gt; went to good college &gt; did well in good college &gt; went to good graduate school / went to good job &gt; etc. I feel like nobody around me has ever had their life plans derailed. I don't feel like an ""imposter,"" or a ""fraud,"" at all, but... I just have trouble relating.

3) As I've left high school and college, I feel like all of my old friends have specialized in different ways, and there's nobody I know who's trying to strike the same sort of work/life balance as me.",OneY
