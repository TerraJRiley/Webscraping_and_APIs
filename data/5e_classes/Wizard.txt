</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Replacing_Your_Spellbook">Replacing Your Spellbook</span></h4>

</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparing_and_Casting_Spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></h3>

</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
</p><p>In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus for the spell save DC of a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
</p><p><b>Spell Attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ritual_Casting">Ritual Casting</span></h3>

<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcane_Tradition"> Arcane Tradition </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of several schools.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Mastery"> Spell Mastery </span></h2>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Infuse_Potions">Infuse Potions</span></h4>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can produce magic potions. You spend 10 minutes focusing your magic on a vial of mundane water and expend a spell slot to transform it into a potion. Once you have expended a spell slot to create a potion, you cannot regain that slot until the potion is consumed or after 1 week, at which time the potion loses its effectiveness. You can create up to three potions at a time; creating a fourth potion causes the oldest currently active one to immediately lose its potency. If that potion has been consumed, its effects immediately end.
</p><p>The spell slot you expend determines the type of potion you can create.

</p><p>You must finish a short rest, then spend 10 minutes with parchment, quill, and ink to create a spell scroll containing one spell chosen from those you know. Subtract the spell's level from the total levels worth of slots you regain using Arcane Recovery. This reduction to your Arcane Recovery applies until you use the scroll and then finish a long rest.

</p><p>In addition, when you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Secrets">Spell Secrets</span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, when you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell's formula as you cast it.
</p><p>When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alchemical_Casting">Alchemical Casting</span></h3>

</p><p>An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.
</p><p>An additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell's range. If the spell's range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.
</p><p>An additional 3rd-level spell slot can increase the spell's potency. Increase the spell's save DC by 2.

<p>At 2nd level, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.
</p><p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes or deals any damage.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Benign_Transposition">Benign Transposition</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Focused_Conjuration">Focused Conjuration</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Divination_Savant">Divination Savant</span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is halved.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Portent">Portent</span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20 and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
</p><p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Expert_Divination">Expert Divination</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Third_Eye">The Third Eye</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions#Incapacitated" title="Conditions">incapacitated</a> or you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a rest.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Darkvision:</b> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
</li><li><b>Ethereal Sight:</b> You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.

</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Greater_Portent">Greater Portent</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Enchantment_Savant">Enchantment Savant</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is halved.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hypnotic_Gaze">Hypnotic Gaze</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, as an action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions#Charmed" title="Conditions">charmed</a> by you until the end of your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions#Incapacitated" title="Conditions">incapacitated</a> and visibly dazed.
</p><p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.
</p><p>Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Instinctive_Charm">Instinctive Charm</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.
</p><p>You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that can't be <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions#Charmed" title="Conditions">charmed</a> are immune to this effect.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Split_Enchantment">Split Enchantment</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alter_Memories">Alter Memories</span></h3>
<p>At 14th level, when you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions#Charmed" title="Conditions">charmed</a>.
</p><p>Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="School_of_Evocation"> School of Evocation </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Evocation_Savant">Evocation Savant</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sculpt_Spells">Sculpt Spells</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Potent_Cantrip">Potent Cantrip</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Empowered_Evocation">Empowered Evocation</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Overchannel">Overchannel</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower (excluding cantrips) that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.
</p><p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="School_of_Illusion"> School of Illusion </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illusion_Savant">Illusion Savant</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Improved_Minor_Illusion">Improved Minor Illusion</span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you learn the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Minor_Illusion" title="Minor Illusion">Minor Illusion</a> cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.
</p><p>When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Malleable_Illusions">Malleable Illusions</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illusory_Self">Illusory Self</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.
</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Illusory_Reality">Illusory Reality</span></h3>
<p>By 14th level, when you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.
</p><p>The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.
</p>

<p>At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with two <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Tools" title="Tools">tools</a> of your choice.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arcanomechanical_Armor">Arcanomechanical Armor</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor—a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.
</p><p>The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. It weighs 8 pounds.
</p><p>You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reckless_Casting">Reckless Casting</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can attempt to cast a spell you don't have prepared. When you use this ability, you use your action and choose one of the following options:
</p>
<ul><li>Roll on the Reckless Casting table for cantrips and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.
</li><li>Expend a spell slot and roll twice on the Reckless Casting table for its level, or the 5th-level table if the slot is 6th level or higher. Pick which of the two results you want to use and cast the resulting spell as part of this action.
</li></ul>
<p>If the spell you cast isn't a <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_Spells" title="Wizard Spells">wizard spell</a>, it is nonetheless a wizard spell for you when you cast it with this feature.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alchemical_Casting_2">Alchemical Casting</span></h3>
<p>At 6th level, when you cast a spell while wearing your automechanical armor and are attuned to it, you can expend one additional spell slot of 1st or 2nd level to alter the spell. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.
</p><p>A 1st-level slot allows you to manipulate the spell's energy. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.
</p><p>A 2nd-level slot increases the spell's raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase that damage by 2d10 force damage against one of the spell's targets (your choice) this turn.

<p>At 10th level, as a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. You can't use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="School_of_Necromancy"> School of Necromancy </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Necromancy_Savant">Necromancy Savant</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grim_Harvest">Grim Harvest</span></h3>
<p>At 2nd level, once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Undead_Thralls">Undead Thralls</span></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you add the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Animate_Dead" title="Animate Dead">Animate Dead</a> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.
</p><p>Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:
</p>
<ul><li>The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
</li><li>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Inured_to_Undeath">Inured to Undeath</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Command_Undead">Command Undead</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.
</p><p>If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transmutation_Savant">Transmutation Savant</span></h3>

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Minor_Alchemy">Minor Alchemy</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Transmuter.27s_Stone">Transmuter's Stone</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
</p>
<ul><li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
</li><li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered
</li><li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
</li><li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)
</li></ul>
<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.
</p><p>If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shapechanger">Shapechanger</span></h3>
<p>At 10th level, you add the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Polymorph" title="Polymorph">polymorph</a> spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast Polymorph without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
</p><p>Once you cast Polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Master_Transmuter">Master Transmuter</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Major Transformation:</b> You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 5—foot cube into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.
</li><li><b>Panacea:</b> You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
</li><li><b>Restore Life:</b> You cast the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Raise_Dead" title="Raise Dead">Raise Dead</a> spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.
</li><li><b>Restore Youth:</b> You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.

</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Technological_Savant">Technological Savant</span></h3>
<p>Also at 2nd level, you trade out your spellbook for a specially attuned storage device, capable of recording magical data. The computing power of this device must be equal to or greater than a tablet computer. Only one storage device can be attuned to you at any given time. Spells can be copied into this device at half the cost of copying spells into a spellbook.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Program_Spell">Program Spell</span></h3>
<p>At 6th level, you can insert a spell within an electronic device of your choosing, so that by touching a key or flicking a switch using an action, the spell activates. All variables of the spell are set at the time of casting. The computing power of this device must be equal to or greater than a mobile phone.
</p><p>A programmed spell remains placed in its device for 48 hours, and is gone once it is discharged. You can use this feature to place a programmed spell in only one device at a time, and a device can hold only one programmed spell. Only you can activate the programmed spell in the device. If the device is destroyed, the programmed spell is lost.
</p><p>A concentration spell placed in a device cannot be activated while you are concentrating on another spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Online_Casting">Online Casting</span></h3>
<p>At 10th level, you can cast spells through networked electronic devices, including cameras, mobile phones, and computers. For example, if a creature is under the observation of a security camera and you can see the video feed from that camera on a computer, you can cast a spell into the computer and out through the security camera to target that creature.
</p><p>If the spell requires the caster to be seen, the target must see you or a live image of you. If the spell requires the caster to be heard, the target must be able to hear you or a live audio transmission of you. The spell's range is determined using the distance from you to your device, and then from the target to its device. You must be able to see or otherwise determine the location of the target. This feature can be used to cast only spells that target specific creatures. Spells that affect an area are not subject to online casting.
</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chained_Device">Chained Device</span></h3>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned to imprint vestiges of your consciousness on electronic devices with significant computing power. When you cast a concentration spell, you can use a device whose computing power is equal to or greater than a tablet computer to maintain concentration of the spell on your behalf. The device must be held or worn by you to maintain this effect. If the device is destroyed, taken from you, dropped, or turned off, the concentration ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
