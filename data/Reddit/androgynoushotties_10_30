Finally decided to start living life as myself. [21],,Androgynoushotties
I‚Äôve never felt better about myself than this pic I took a few weeks ago,,Androgynoushotties
Feeling complicated,"When I was younger, I always found myself attracted to tomboyish women who were confident. This usually lead to me having crushes on lesbians more often than straight women.

Just for context- I am a genetic male and the world sees me that way. I am okay that people call me cisgendered even if nonbinary may seem like a more accurate definition. I sometimes feel like I want to be a girl and other times I like being a guy. I am an attractive guy to others but I'm also a masculine guy. I don't find that masculinity attractive. I would love to look androgynous. I think who I am as a person is both a guy and a girl's mind. That mentality. I don't care whether the world accepts that or uses any specific pronoun. I just want to be happy with myself.

My presence here also has much to do with satisfying my curiosity. I love having a better understanding of why people feel and behave the way they do. Understanding others helps me better understand myself. In the past few months I've picked up an interest in researching quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and quantum physics. Everything is quantum. There is so much I don't know about the subject but I try to learn as much as I can because I strongly believe that it's only a matter of time before quantum computing becomes mainstream. And when quantum computing becomes mainstream people will stop thinking binary. Classical computing operates on a binary system. Which has worked great for a long time. When people feel that qbits are common sense they will have a better foundation for understanding complicated gender identities and sexualities.

Binary thinking enforces this fallacy that if you aren't one thing then you are the opposite. That's a fallacy. If it isn't day time than it's nighttime completely disregards early morning and evening. Quantum physics makes it understandable that something can be YES and NO or 1 and 0 at the same time. When something is measured, it collapses into a state of 1 or 0. I encourage everyone, especially people who are interested in a more progressive world, to research this subject.

If you understand our universe, you will understand the humans in it and you will better understand yourself. You and I are the same. My right hand doesn't stab my left hand because it is different. Two parts of the same whole. Find someone who believes the opposite of you. Understanding someone who you disagree with will make you stronger and could possibly encourage them to better understand you. The right hand and the left hand can lift so much more together than they can independently of one another. 

I love reading about conservatives like Steven Crowder and Mark Rubio- not because I agree with them but because I disagree with them. I am a neutral person. It's hard for me to empathize with the right or left because I feel for both sides and wish both sides would aspire to be more tolerant of each other and better communicate with one another.

Thank you everyone.,"This might be a little bit personal but thank you everyone for posting here and just being so in tune with yourselves. As an androgynous girl, me being gender-ambiguous has always been one of my biggest insecurites, and it‚Äôs been getting worse these past few years, to the point where I actually dislike being in public altogether because of how I look &amp; the looks people give me because I know they don‚Äôt know what gender I am. 
But you are all helping me embrace my uniqueness (sorry if that sounds clich√©/corny) or maybe I should say you are helping me embrace androgynousness x) Either way, thank you all. seeing how good looking and stunning you all are gives me so much encouragement and helping me with my social anxiety and I feel a bit more confident now. Again,sorry if this sounds whiny or personal...

Need advice on how to makeup like a man,"Hello, second time posting here, you guys welcomed me very warmly the first time and I'm grateful for that, thank you all.
I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I'm looking to do a photoshoot as a male, or at least androgynous to the point you can't tell I'm a female. I have pretty girly facial features I think (I can provide a pic if you want one) and can't seem to find any decent tutorial on how to look manlier. Would anyone have advices ? Whether it be links to videos, tutorials, or actual ideas you have. That'd be wonderful.

Edit : I tried a makeup today and am not sure of the quality of the result, so here it is.
