So to say Valkyrie was the ONLY counter to mass death ults is just incorrect.<br/><br/>But Valkyrie wasn't nerfed because it robbed DPS mains of their kills.  I don't know how many times I have to tell you people this.  Valkyrie was nerfed because no other support hero could give their team an 8v6 advantage in every fight, and that caused Mercy to become a must-pick at every level of the game.<br/><br/>I also think people remember hide-and-rez a little too fondly.  I don't think mass-rez was unbalanced or unfair and the developers never said that was the issue.  Everyone agreed that it encouraged poor play and ""strategic death"".<br/><br/>Have you even been watching the Overwatch League?  Everyone from DPS to tanks to supports CAN'T WAIT for this patch to sink in because right now Mercy and her ult status and whether she is alive or dead is the single deciding factor of just about every team fight.</blockquote><br/><br/>See i disagree. A properly used Lucio or Zen ult can (best case) turn at 6v6 fight into a 12v6 fight. You have to do twice as much damage to most players to deal with the effects of their ultimates. I know what you're thinking, the effects wear off quickly. Yup. They do. So in reality, you're probably talking about 7/8v6. The time during the lucio/zen ults is basically wasted in the same way the time to re-kill another player is wasted. <br/><br/>And you're also assuming that Mercy survives long enough to get both res's off. Usually, yes she does. But she can be stopped. Lucio and Zen can't be. <br/><br/>Lets also not forget lucio and zen can both do other things *while healing*. They can damage and discord and boop etc, while their heals are working. <br/><br/>You can't compare 1 set of abilities and ignore the rest. Mercy can heal. Thats it. Or damage boost. Or dps. But not at the same time. Zen can Heal, damage boost, AND DPS at the same time. Granted his heal is worse than mercys, but his damage boost is better, and his damage is too. <br/><br/>Finally, it doesn't change the fact that Mercy, as she sits right now, is kinda useless. If anything, they could have at *least* buffed her healing abilities during Valk, so it would be more possible to keep someone alive. <br/><br/>Today I just came out of a game where I popped valk, and focused heals on my team's DVa.

It's not that people are mad that you're ""undoing the DPS player's handiwork""... <br/><br/>Just think... who can teamwipe? Plenty heroes can with a well placed ult or just an amazing series of plays or a strong team working together on a push... You can't say only Soldier 76's ult or Genji's ult, etc... can team wipe....<br/><br/>Now on the flipside, who could undo a teamwipe that already happened? ONLY MERCY. That fact alone put her in much higher demand than any other healer(hence her near 100% pickrate). That's unhealthy for the game. <br/><br/>It would be the same if there somehow was a tank that could deploy a shield like Orisa, had the mobility of D.Va, and durability of Roadhog. It's not good for a character of a class to have so many more advantages than the other members of that class. That's where the balance issue comes in.</blockquote><br/>Before the Valk rework, Mercy had a normal pick rate. Her pick rate only went to 100% after the Valk rework. Even after multiple nerfs, she maintained that pick rate. High pick rate had nothing to do with Huge Rez. If you believe that, you weren't around back in the day.</blockquote>, <br/>, ""Realistically Zenyatta can undo a teamwipe by preventing it with his ultimate. Lucio can undo a teamwipe by preventing it with his ultimate. So Mercy never prevented it she just undid the teamwipe and it was more noticable because it was on the kill feed and everything. If it showed damage blocked or damage healed from Lucio/Zenyatta you would've asked for those ultimates to be nerfed as well. What about abilities that can fully deny an ultimate. You didn't even need to expend an ultimate with Dva and Genji to deny an ultimate. Atleast Mercy needed to use her ultimate to do so. So that's an invalid point. If it was shown on the Kill feed that Genji deflected a Zarya ultimate or Dva absorbed a Zarya Grav people would be just as pissed as Mercy rezzing her team. Her near 100% pickrate was due to the Dev's reworking her and basically giving her a very super mobile ultimate and her Resurrect was still a huge part of the ultimate. Instead of working on her teamfighting potential by giving her Valkyrie and reworking Mass Resurrect into being balanced they screwed her over into a boring and stale hero.

The challenge is that imagining the Queen as a flamethrower, as several of you have done, limits a little bit the fantasy of the character. In a way her mechanics will feel very similar to the Pyro from TF2, every other character with a flamethrower in any videogame, and even our own Mei. The actual flamethrower is the spear besides her throne, connected to a cannister on her back (again, very similar to Mei). I have chosen not to use the axe that appears in the poster. As a defense/tank hybrid, her Ult summons the Queen's battle mech. Doesn't have ""tanking"" abilities, but a gains a lot of HP, reduced damage intake, and increased healing. That, plus the larger form, makes her a bit of an offtank.<br/><br/>Look and Feel: You have all seen the picture of the Queen. Regarding the Battle Mech, it either is the ""King"" mech, or it looks kind of the powerlifter Ripley uses in Alien (with cannons isntead of pliers). All in all, TankGirl comes to mind.<br/><br/>Abilities:<br/><br/>Hero Form: 250 HP<br/><br/>LMB - Flamethrower Spear / 80 dps frontal cone / 2 meter width, 10 meter range / 5 second afterburn. 10 dps / doesnt consume ammo. Overheats after 6 seconds. 1 second downtime / Melee uses spear as a melee weapon (thrust forward). <br/><br/>Passive - Cauterize / Fatal damage brings the Queen to 35% health. Effect triggers automatically / Not on an actual cooldown, but effect can not happen more than once every 20 seconds<br/><br/>E - Petrol Flask / Throws a cannister of oil that breaks on impact. Can be thrown on the ground or at enemies. 5 meter radius / By itself it does nothing. In order to to damage, it needs to be ignited with flamethrower / Oil burns for 8 seconds. Enemies affected with ignited oil will burn for 8 seconds at 20 hp per second. Lasts for 4 seconds if not ignited / 10 second cooldown / Enemies affected with ignited oil are not affected with afterburn. (To clarify, if an enemy is hit with the flask, and gets ignited, it will burn for 8 seconds. If the enemy walks into a burning oil patch that had been already burning for 6 seconds, hero will still have burn effect on itself for 8 seconds). <br/><br/>Ultimate - Junkertown's Gladiator / Summons the Queen's Battle Mech for 20 seconds / New set of abilities / Falls apart when it reached 0HP or when Ult time expires / 30% damage reduction and 50% increased healing.<br/><br/>Battle Mech Form: 450 HP<br/><br/>LMB - Twin Fireball Cannons / Shoots fireballs that explode on contact / 12 rounds per second (6 from each cannon) 15 damage per round on direct hit. 10 splash / linear projectiles / Infinite ammo<br/><br/>E - Petrol Flask / 2 charges. Gets ignited with fireballs.</blockquote><br/><br/>Where is Rmb and shift?Also u made her a melee hero with a flame spear ?
