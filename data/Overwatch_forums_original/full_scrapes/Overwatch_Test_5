"Hi everyone, We've continued to see a heavy influx of conversations revolving around today's hero balance updates impacting Mercy. In an effort to consolidate feedback and create a consistent location for users to share their impressions or opinions, please use this thread. MercyValkyrieNo longer makes Resurrect instantNo longer grants a bonus Resurrect chargeThe speed bonus Guardian Angel receives when activating Valkyrie has been decreased by 50%Duration reduced from 20 seconds to 15 secondsDeveloper Comments: Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her, but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes. Additionally, we’re toning back the amount of mobility Valkyrie provides through Guardian Angel and reducing its duration to overall reduce the power of this ability.We appreciate your feedback, as it will assist us and provide insight on improving your Overwatch experience.

We recognize that people were having fun with the exploit but it caused server instability and negatively impacted other players which is why we have removed it. We really want to bring functionality like this to Overwatch and we’re doing research now into how we can support these custom game settings.

"Hi everyone, We wanted to take some time to explain the recent movement changes in depth (with examples). Hopefully this will help everyone better understand what changed, and what did not.Incline Changes:There were two persistent issues with movement on inclines that we wanted to clean up.First, while moving diagonally on inclines you would end up being slightly strafed left or right even if you were only attempting to move forward. This can be a subtle source of aiming issues for many people, and now the player will properly move forward in this situation.  Second, movement up and down inclines had inconsistent speed as compared to the ground. Running both up and down an incline would be faster than walking on flat ground.  However faster movement (e.g. McCree’s Combat Roll) would be slower when going up and down inclines. Having consistent character movement speed is important for many reasons, the biggest of which is it allows you to be able to reliably know how to aim your hitscan shots or lead your projectile fire.Acceleration changes:The characters in Overwatch have a fixed acceleration (how fast they can change their movement velocity) depending on if they are in the air or on the ground.  Previously, this amount would get reduced if you were attempting to change your direction by 90 degrees or less, and was more pronounced if you were going faster than normal (e.g. Winston’s Jump Pack or Doomfist’s Rocket Punch). One of the consequences of this was that if you were in the air travelling forward and wanted to move directly right, you could reach full speed to the right faster if you accelerated backwards to a full stop and then moved to the right, as opposed to simply pressing to the right. Having to do a non-intuitive movement to reach your desired direction as fast as possible is less than ideal, so we made a change to allow you to more consistently use the air acceleration you already had to reach the direction you'd like to be moving in.The new acceleration can feel like momentum is no longer conserved like before, but the forward velocity is just more efficiently being converted into sideways velocity. The direction is changing faster but your overall speed isn’t being slowed down.  Examples: If you're flying as Pharah, you can now just press forward and you will properly accelerate moving forward, instead of having to counter accelerate to stop sideways drift. If you’re leaping as Winston, you can more effectively redirect your velocity around corners. Prior to this rework it was possible to achieve similar mid-air turns by always facing your current velocity while strafing, but this was also unintuitive.You can now press forward and right directional inputs after a Winston leap and you will actually move some to the right, whereas previously you would have to only hold right if you wanted to get any acceleration to the right.It does mean getting used to the new strafing power. No longer do you have to hold strafe for a long time to get a small adjustment to your movement, you can simply short hold or tap it as needed, and pressing forward with a left or right command will do smaller adjustments than if pressing left or right alone.This does not substantially affect movement when trying to change movement direction by >90 degrees.Additionally, left and right strafing on the ground and air will be the same along with attempting to accelerate against a knockback will be the same.We’re keeping an eye on these changes to make sure everything is working correctly. Any feedback would be appreciated, and would be especially helpful with any screenshots or videos.","

"Hmm, so it doesn't sound like it's too impactful for heroes just jumping up and down to avoid being shot, which is good. Don't think people would accept a Genji buff, as he primarily goes left-right-left-right during battles, and that's >90.","

Possibly if players wished to do something other than 2/2/2 they could select other options like 1/3/2.This system seems to work in other role/class based games and I feel like it would greatly decrease toxicity and encourage players to play other roles (DPS would probably have a slightly longer que).Im posting this idea to receave feedback and possibly be noticed.","

"- His play style favors pushing a team around them, her's is about making a   blockade around her.  I.E. He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.  Orisa shield 900 health, CD.Both have their purposes and usage, so I see both as interchangeable depending on the team needs and situations.","

"i stopped playing Comp when your SR effects your QP match making. I noticed that smurff accounts with almost NO gametime are winding up on QP, with an SR rating similar to mine. I made the motion to STOP climbing with my SR because of my direct feelings of Discrimination in Comp. Comp is very ""grey"" in color with no diversity. I thought this game was about diversity, comp does NOT reflect these same values that blizzard states they are about. I watched on youtube,  their Director of game design and their voice actor hiring person talk about diversity in this game and how important it was to blizzard. However since Comp does not respect this business model. I have silently protested this season for this reason.The other reason is, we are given SR only based upon w/L, which means are outcome has been pre-determined by blizzard, BEFORE we started the game. I should be awarded for efforts, NOT win/Loss. I don't know of ANY game out there, other than overwatch that does this.For example: Blizzard determines the best team for you to match with, the player skill rating for them is good. However 2 or 3 of these randomly at will, these players decide that spending 90% of the time T-bagging someone in the comp-match is a better use of their time. Guess what, you just lost the game and not because you chose to. No matter how hard you played, those 2 or 3 players that are bagging around, have costed you, your game! ""so report them"". Yeah thats great, they get banned, I still get the loss and the penalty.","

That being said, it's not always easy to get others online to play with you as everyone has different schedules and ect. There's apps and stuff online that you can use to find others to play with as a team. If that's not up your alley though, then just try the best your can.

"02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonHi, I'm here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a player can have: Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little, and it seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Throughout the entire Christmas Event, I kept trying to get some new skins that I liked (Like Hanzos and Soldiers) but in the end, I got ALL the Voicelines, sprays, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes (Except Orisas). No new skins at all.02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonit seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Same happened in the Summer Games ;-;","

"02/20/2018 10:08 AMPosted by Akigokubut isnt it the flankers job to kill the supports??More like deal with supports; not be easy kills.Why I prefer the Medic from TF2. His weapon wasn't the strongest, BUT could still punish bad plays on people trying to flank (Mostly Scout)This game, the flanker characters have so many escapes and tools to make the fight THEIRS that it's insane to me to think that any support should have such weak self defense tools.If you engage on a Moira in an enclosed space, you should die.If you engage on an Ana with both cooldowns up, you should die. But that isn't the case in this game. Support characters should feel powerful and impactful; they're the ones who HAVE to hold the team up. The Medic felt that way; while not a huge killing machine, he was both a game changer AND able to defend himself when needed. The Übercharge was the most powerful ability in the game, it defined the competitive meta.Soon as a support is deemed too meta defining, they're nerfed and nerfed.Yeah, some of the nerfs WERE needed (Ana's Grenade, Mercy's res issues) but then are left weaker and unfun until the next Witch Hunt begins.Where's the Witch Hunt for Tracer? She has almost always been the BEST pick for DPS unless of a cheesy strat (Bayblade or Pirate Ship) or another DPS was just buffed too much (Mei's ult charge, 76's 20 damage, McSniper, etc.). She is in almost every single competitive game, and in 79% of OWL. I get it, high skill high reward; except what about Ana? She has arguably a much higher skill floor than Tracer, yet has been the worst support since March 21st of last year.","

"Not having fun playing against this heroe because:A)	His normal attack has too much range and his ball does too much damage.B)	His mines in combination with his ball attack does too much burst damage.C)	His Ult Riptire has too much HP and his Ult in general can be performed with little harm to the player.  Just hide.For point A. I think that he should be good at primarily close quarter damage.  I don’t see the need for him to be able to spam his ball attacks from super far away.  Furthermore, I think the ball attack must make contact with the enemy before doing any type of damage, so no splash damage.  For point B. there is not much you can do if Junkrat got you with one hit, his mines will finish you off.  My suggestion would be to change the effects of his mines from doing damage to doing movement displacement like Pharas knockback rocket. For point C. Not every hero can take out the Riptire on their own, it requires incredible reaction and precision for what this ult can do.  Furthermore, it has very small weaknesses that a good player can remove with proper positioning and movement.  I would suggest reducing the HP of the Riptire and making it so that is slows down after each second time spend running.   Alternatively, the Riptire can be made to follow a straight path like Hanzo’s ult and be detonated at the users request.These are my opinions, I know I am not high ranked and I don’t know everything about this game. I just proving my feedback from my ranks perspective.  It is not fun for me and my friends to play against a player that know how to abuse this hero’s abilities. It takes too much effort to take him out from certain hero’s perspectives.   Thank you for reading and have a nice day.","

"Generally, fighting and losing against enemy isn't fun. Though from what you describe, its more on your tanks needing to switch to D.Va to create space for them to move about and deal with Junkrat or adopting their methods in response to Junkrat.Though on the opposite side, I'm also pretty darn sick of seeing Winston/Zarya and D.Va combo whenever I run Junkrat simply because of how well they can shut a Junkrat down. I can also tell you that I absolutely despise tracer, genji, winston and D.va simply because of how little you can do against that comp.Junkrat has weaknesses, its really up to you and your team to adopt against it. If you want to win(If that's how you have fun.), then either you or your friend has to step up.","

That is not Junkrat's fault however. It's just that he can get a lot more value when people just let him do his thing. Wich at our rank is the case way to often.It's a shame that blizzard doesn't reward people for counter picking, and doesn't punish getting destroyed by one of your counters in some way.

"Edit: Since Symmetra has now been addressed, I have updated the section about QoL adjustments with discussion within the megathread to make it easier for the developer team to read.This is extremely long, but I want to illustrate Symmetras problems and how to fix them, hopefully to enlighten the devs on how to fix her. There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Overwatch&utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]Discussion consolidated:These are the biggest things that needed to be addressed according to the megathread.Defensive assists for shield gen, as well as the ultimate voiceline ""flashing"" the ultimate location and radius to teammates for 5 seconds.More assists in general for Symmetra, perception of teamplay is just as big of an issue as how much is within her kit. Offensive assists could possibly be added to teleporter (while the visual effect is active on teammates) as well as turrets.Photon barrier is a handicapped supportive utility compared to other support utility that is meant to protect. Most things will spawn past it when you use it (roadhog hooks, flashbang) and you can't really aim it on teammates. Please look at improving it.Her ultimates incentivize her to play alone and practice nesting rather than play with her team, please give her more options for teamplay in the actual kit. Her killing potential is strong, so this should be a minor utility that can compete with healing without being as strong as healing as to not raise her winrate but make her ""feel"" better in a team game. People have suggested everything from an opposite of discord, to decaying shields, to reworking photon barrier so that it can supply decaying shields to teammates with a lower cooldown (either passing through, or activation like orisas ultimate)Teamplay is her biggest issue, by far. Her killing potential is decent for a dps offsupport. Number adjustments may make her too strong at lower tiers where she is considered better balanced.","

"(reserving this post to edit in other suggestions from the community, not the point of this thread, but here to voice any suggestions)FIRST OFF: I want to caution that reworking ideas are not the point behind this thread. More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools.","

"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact.","

"To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs.","
							 (Edited)

"Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect.","

"Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team.","

"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die.","

"Seriously, you guys need to lay off the Symm change ideas.. especially a lot of this complete reworks.  Symm is near perfect the way she is.. it is the community toxicity and the lack of use in the pro scene that holds her back.The pros don’t use her because she take a lot of practice and committment to the hero and lets face it.. the top pros would rather practice on skills that are easily transferable to other heroes, then practice a hero (like mercy who before she became a reworked OP mess— remember she was NU in pro play before her rework) who has a unique playstyle to use at a high level.  She could use some tweeks to help at higher level.. like making her ult silent.. or turret deployment improvements.. but anything else would make her way too dominate at the lower levels.","

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest.","

"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754867190#post-1I made a post about this in May and trying to bring it back now.Saying sym is a no skill hero is fukin stupid if people dont play her. People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad.","

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :(","

"I feel like for her Photon Barrier, it could get the Orisa treatment, just make it curvier to the sides so it can help block damage.Just curious OP, what do you think of this? Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility.","

Finally, she has a reload time.

So apparently players of my skill level are players with SR 200 or more above me, always on the enemy team. My team are actual similar skill level and often times lower. Yeah sure you could just say ""get gud"" I'd love to but it's really hard to ""get gud"" when these games are so one sided there's no way for me to possibly improve when my team is just rolled over every time. And in the rare case that I get all the high skill level players on my team, there's again no way for me to improve when my team just rolls over the enemy with little to no effort.I don't mind one tricks, I can deal with smurfs, but when I'm losing because the game itself has terrible matchmaking pitting one low to average skill team against a high skill team, it really demotivates me from playing.I used to say ""I don't think I'll ever want to stop playing this game."" I mean heck look at my level I'm level 1294 currently almost at my second gold star. I clearly put a lot of time into this game and loved it. But recently this matchmaking has been getting worse and worse, and I'm finding myself playing this game much less than half the time that I used to. I miss having good and even games, having close games that go into overtime, and awesome team fights. But now it seems that games just last 1-2 minutes because one team just rolls over the other. Or max time because one team can't even push past the first choke. Sorry for this ranty post, you can ignore it, downvote it or whatever, I just needed to vent about this. I'm probably still going to play the game but likely just stick around for just events, and very few times in between. Until matchmaking actually makes fair games, I just can't have fun with this game anymore.","

"Because I'm genuinely getting sick of being backfilled into games that are already on the results screen and not even getting that tiny amount of backfill XP for it.https://i.imgur.com/iKePUfK.jpgI soloq a lot, so the matchmaker seems to prioritize me for backfill. Don't get me wrong, I understand why the matchmaker needs to do this, but so many games, I'll join and instantly be faced with a DEFEAT screen before I've even had a chance to lock in my hero.I understand the very nature of the matchmaker will stop this issue from ever being 100% solved, but here's a few simple changes I propose to reduce the impact and make matchmaking far less stressful:1) Do not allow backfill during overtime, unless it's an ad hoc connection (a player actively choosing to join that specific game from the menu) or the player is already spectating and waiting for a slot. Let's be real, the odds of you being able to change anything in a 5v6 overtime are slim to none, about as high as the odds of you backfilling onto the winning team during that time.2) Give me more than a few hundred extra XP. I don't know what, maybe you could double my base XP during my next game, then maybe I won't get as frustrated when I do end up in these games.3) Put a cooldown between how frequently an individual can be backfilled. The amount of time I spend in queue jumping from endscreen to endscreen because the matchmaker repeatedly backfills me into impossible scenarios is directly impacting the amount of time I'm able to play. It would be nice if whenever I finish a backfill match, there was say, an hour during which time the game would lower or completely eliminate my odds of being backfilled.I'm not asking for a matchmaker overhaul, I'm asking to be able to play the game without getting salty before I've had a chance to play.","

"Mercy 1.0 was fun, but actually only a little less underpowered then she is now.  The reason why: Mercy had no abilities in her base kit that let her actively participate in the fight.  This railroaded Mercy players into basing their entire playstyle around the only active ability Mercy had: her ult, mass rez.Adressing hide n rez: this tactic came down to two sources - SR abusers and people who went waaay out of their way to hide in buildings, rooms below the point, and generally areas that took a while to get to (but was still in range of rez, since it didn't require LoS).  The SR abuse problem has been retroactiely solved with the removal of preformance based SR in diamond and above, and a LoS restriction would force Mercy to put herself out in the open to rez (giving enemies a chance to cc/kill her and eliminating the hide-and-seek minigame).  And one last thing: most Mercy players hated doing hide and rez - it was THEIR TEAMMATES who demanded it, and got toxic if the Mercy didn't.  The standard playstyle of Mercy is to stay with your team as long as possible, only ducking into cover if your team is taking more damage than you can heal/if you see an ult wipe incoming.I don't want to go back to a version of Mercy that doesn't have the GA bunnyhop, but I also hate rez on E with a passion and don't even consider Valkyrie to be an ultimate.  The best solution (to me) seems to be putting a balanced version of Mass Rez on Q, and figuring out an E ability that incentivises Mercy to stay with her team and use it to directly participate in the fight.","

Hide-and-go-Res wasn't LoS abuse.  Far, far from it.  It was where unskilled Mercy players would basically only play with their teams until they got ult, then they would hide away in some corner of the map far away from the teamfight.  They would probably instruct their team to all die on point, then wait for everyone to die before swooping in virtually uncontested for a huge res.  They did this to boost themselves into high ranks, because Performace SR rewarded players who performed more huge reses.I'm well aware of the predominant Mercy strategy to hide when enemy ults come.  The best Mercies I played with Tempo-resed all of the time.  But that doesn't change that poor Mercies were abusing SR gain from huge res by hiding regardless of the situation.And no, it wasn't retroactively solved by only removing performance-based SR in the highest ranks.  It will need to be removed across all ranks for Hide-and-Res to become less of an issue.  Want to know why?

"OH i enjoyed Mass Rez, except when the enemy teams' mercy popped out of nowhere on a Team kill and screamed her infamous lines in German, for resurrecting the whole team on the Payload and having them finish the fight. It did make mercy the wildcard in the game, because if you didn't kill mercy or find her in time, she re-started the fight. I look at this from both aspects: Positive and negative. I think the fight dynamics were most interesting before the single target rez and Valkyrie.Valkyrie though, has opened up a box of snakes. It encourages battle mercy. The community HATES this, but battle mercy IS fun this way. I just hit Valkyrie, yes the team is spamming I am ""Prick thrower"" for not healing. but I just mowed down the entire enemy team with a pistol. As for Widow VS Valkyrie mercy, its gg for widow. Even with well-placed headshots, mercy is still going strong. Valkyrie allows for Revenge kills with mercy, she can fly around anywhere and go after the player she has a grudge against.","

I only hope Blizzard would actually succeed and fix it.And this is coming from a big fan of new heroes. While new heroes do affect the rest of the game like change the meta, the broken/bad stuff we currently have is ruining the fun.A few things I can remember right now is when you disconnect 1 second before the match ends, even if you win you will receive a defeat and -50 SR. If the server dies and you get kicked, defeat and -50 SR. Disconnect, come back 10 seconds after and win the match? Defeat and -50 SR.  It takes months and months to make a simple change to a hero. Took 2 years to fix a Mei bug. Competitive is a mess, it's random, a lot of the times you can't play what you want unless you disregard what the team needs, and lots of people who play Competitive completely disregarding what the team needs.It's not fun when 95% of effort gets put into new content and 5% into existing content.","

"For one, even a decent Widowmaker requires a lot of mechanical skill, which is rather noteworthy. Someone who can track well with a sniper is most likely going to be a major asset to the team and cripple the enemy when played right.Also, Widowmaker has a lot of weaknesses in close quarters, hence her need to stay away from the brunt of the fight. I get that it sucks to be one-shot (a legitimate one-shot, not just multiple damage sources in short time-frame), but there are strengths and weaknesses to each character. Do remember that she is a Defense hero: she specializes in zoning areas. Having the possibility of being one-shot or losing a major amount of health is usually enough to encourage shields, strafing, or just outright avoiding the area.You gotta choose your battles.","

"The best course of action is to be mindful of the info you're given. Once the match starts you can check to see who's on the opposing team, and there will be audio queues from your character and/teammates letting you know there's a sniper. If you do get killed, watch the kill cam. It'll let you know where they're hiding, and you can plan accordingly.","

"Stream Sniping:  It's an intentional act to try to queue and get placed in the same game/match as the Streamer with the intention of ruining the Streamer's game/stream.  For example, Timthetatman was targeted by that stream sniper who would either get on his team, and throw.  Or be on the enemy team and would target Timthetatman over everyone else.

Not to mention another ape-based hero would be SOOOO underwhelming. I can hear the giant sigh of disappointment in the player base already. Every character that has been introduced is always different than the last. I expect the trend to continue.","

02/20/2018 11:04 AMPosted by Meowcenaryhttps://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Jetpack_CatLikely never gonna happen tho unfortunately. The idea was scrappedSuch a missed opportunity if they dont make it so. The reasons Jeff gave just dont sell it to me. He said the idea of a flying cat was too outlandish even for Overwatch but we have a talking scientist gorilla...he also said they ran into trouble designing the paws to work with the jetpack controls but I feel D Va's in-mech view is exactly this. So...why the difficulty? He said it was a scrapped idea but I would not be surprised if it was a hint of things to come. I just dont see it not being feasible and another animal hero would be a pretty bad !@# addition to the roster.,"

"Ok I was thinking a while back: What if jetpack cat was in the game. How would you make a cat with a jetpack a fighter? This is my take on it:Name: JetCat (because jetpack cat may be to long for the character select screen)Class: DefensePrimary Fire: 50 Damage ScratchSecondary Fire: Opens Up a Scope, Shots do 90 Damage a hit. Scope has a laser sight showing where the shots will go. Special frequency of light that only cat eyes can see.Ability 1:Tangle: Places A hairball on the ground in front of them. Anyone who walks through them will be slowed to 50% speed and mobility abilities are reduced by 50%. Can have 5 out at a time, must wait 5 seconds before placing another one. Does not stack with other hairball.Second Ability: Prowl: Jetpack Cat Becomes invisible all except for its eyes, similiar to a cat in the dark, for 5 seconds. Can shoot while invisible. 8 Second cooldown.Ultimate: Flight: JetCat's jetpack flies off and can either attach to an ally, who then gains control and can use it however, or can attach to an enemy and carry cool down.Thoughts?","

"Coming up with ideas of how it would work is the easy part. He/she could be a flying character similar to Pharah but without as much up-time (somewhere in between DVa's boosters and Pharah's hover). Maybe a hit-scan flyer but with slow mobility while airborne but when on the ground much faster however a different weapon, ability is used.","

"D.Va's accuracy is really not that important. For lots of heroes it isn't since there are a ton of factors that can inflate/deflate it. My D.Va accuracy probably hovers around 20%. She has lots of spread and a lot of her time shooting is spent just poking at enemies, so you cannot expect it to be too high. As for tips, try to find a nice medium between offensive and defensive with her. Only peel off for enemies who are all alone and you know you can get without your mech being destroyed. By and large you want to stay with your team. D.Va is not indestructable and her biggest weakness is how easy it is to melt her mech, so you must work around this weakness. D.Va's mobility and tankiness isn't to charge into the enemy team and try to assassinate an enemy while their entire team is around. You have to punish out of position enemies and go pick off the flankers. Having a high sensitivity isn't important and you need to find the sens you are most comfortable with. Sensitivity is all about preference so if you're having a hard time tracking enemies, I'd consider lowering it! Mine on console is just 65/65 and I find it works great for me tbh.","

I try to emulate the Dvas who get kills by launching it into the air but can never seem to get anyone with them unless they are stunned by other ults.For the bombs I would suggest working on sliding the bombs off of walls/objects. Those will be the sneakiest bombs since they get caught on the wall for a second until they slide out into the open and explode. Shooting the bomb off into the air at an angle also works well for me. I have little luck shooting it straight up into the air (it's just so predictable and differing sky boxes means where the bomb ends up detonating isn't consistent since it may hit the sky box or may not) and I would suggest you never ult to salvage your mech except for in the rare cases you /know/ your team can still win the fight and having you will help. Your best bet is to go into custom games and check out the best walls to slide your bomb off of (watch out because it can get stuck on some!)","

					",,,,,,,
One of D.Va's biggest asset is her mobility. Jump in and out of fights and punish when you see opportunities. When your team is pushing use her to create space. When you're under fire always try to show your back to minimize damage. Mastering this will make your DVa a lot more durable. Mix that with your DM too ofc.Always focus on the high priority targets or the ones that D.Va easily kills in a single rush missile combo.,"
						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"Tips for Dva, her DM should be saved for eating orbs and enemy ults.  You really shouldn't be using it to ""tank"".  Its more of gobble ults and occasionally protect allies out of position or allies pulled by hog.  You can also use DM when you are diving in on the enemy.  Dva is meant to be played aggressively, when you see an opportunity to dive on an enemy support do so.  Dive at them rocket in their face while shooting them and then melee.  They are typically dead with this combo.","

"This would cause more problems than it solves. People would click the category with the shortest wait time then play what they want anyways (invalidating the entire system). If you force them to play the role they select then DPS would have insane wait times. You'd also open the doors for throwers to pick support and just troll DPS players who waited ten minutes for a match (And giving a fast-lane for griefers). You'd also run into the issue of DPS players unable to hit Pharah due to no experience on Hitscan. But if you have supports who can, the system wont let them swap mid game. That is of course you allow a system to bypass the initial system... which then defeats the purpose of the role select system from the get go.","

I solo que.Not to mention I CAN play other heroes and so could most people on my team. Being a one trick is playing one sole HERO not one sole role. It's just that we all had all of OUR hours on support except for me and the tank guy. Also I'm a tank AND support main. -_-I just call myself a support main because people call me that even though I play more hours on tank than I want to.And last I checked you don't have to be great at every hero in the game. There are a ton of players that climbed with only 3 to 4 heroes (I can play 7 hereos comfortably). Plus I dont like being dps, I like having large health pools and being able to heal myself before anyone else.  I could go into detail on why I don't like playing most dps heroes in Overwatch but it's really just down to none of them have a playstyle that I've liked so far. Oh I can play dps. I'm just not consistent. Sometimes I do really well and other times I'm just there to feed the enemy. Not to mention in every game people instalock dps. And I only play comp. If I were to play dps in comp people would report me for throwing because they see my hours aren't on dps. I can't play quick play because it's boring to me. I guess I could Smurf and instalock dps on a second account, otherwise it really wouldn't be wise for me to practice in comp. Plus don't forget the fact that I would be hella bored playing characters I don't want to play. I didn't have this problem playing Paladins. At least in that game there were about 3 champions in every role that I liked and was really good at. Tyra, Viktor, Lian...Ruckus, Fernando, Torvald...Seris, Ying, Jenos...Can't wait for a ""then go back to Paladins"" comment.I don't know why I'm so different in Overwatch.

"The amount of time on the PTR shouldn't factor in, loads of people don't use it and it would be unfair on them to see it go right to comp. Particularity with Blizzard World as its long time in the PTR means players who use it a lot will be far more experienced than the rest of us will be even after a couple of weeks in live.I personally don't use the PTR as I've never got that satisfying games on it and the race to instalock whoever is undergoing changes means you rarely get much practice on them. I deleted it for the extra memory and just experience changes through QP before hitting comp, like many other people.","

"I don't consider her a top-tier pick in DM but I'd say the damage orb is probably the dumbest ability currently in DM. At least when a genji or tracer steals my kills they have to be somewhat aware of the situation unfolding and have the cognitive ability to either aim their cursor or press swift strike and most importantly of all the person they are killing is actually on their screen. Moira on the other hand doesn't even need to be at their keyboard and that isn't an exaggeration. You can fire the orb in a random direction,get up and go get a drink and come back to multiple kills.","

"Brah you don't know half of Riot game's history. They've done some SHADY crap to try and push out competition like DotA in their life time. A few notable examples off the top of my head are:Phreak originally ran a forum and community for DotA. When he signed onto LoL the website became a beacon of adverts for the game while the archive of forum posts disappeared. When the archive of the forums resurfaced a few years later, LoL was already a big name.So a big employee killed a hangout for the community of an old game that his company based their game off of. Who cares right? I'm sure the creators of Rammus and Teemo care since there were some odd looking holes in the archives of the hero suggestions sub forum. That's right, Rammus and Teemo were originally fan hero ideas for DotA 1 back in the day but their creators never got any credit and can't prove it any more.Oh and there's also that time where LoL tried to force esport teams to exclusively only field LoL teams and cut ties with their biggest competitors like DotA.I honestly don't care that much about this whole thing at the moment because I don't like the Olympic content too much besides the Symmetra emote and because I only play this game on rare occasions lately. But what they've done isn't enough for me to flip tables over LoL's ""free to play"" model of spending as good as a few years of your life to get all of the champions and maybe a few more for all of the runes and rune pages to be competitive in a solo queue. I say this as someone who has a ranked icon for every season but S3.","

I remember how broken Frost Mage was and how almost every 2's Arena team was Unholy DK/Holy Paladin. Blizzard didn't get around to fixing DKs until the expansion was almost over, and Frost Mage was retarded for even longer than that.Riot had their fair share of !@#$ups...like release Xin Zhao and Kassadin in general. LoL's balance is about as good as Overwatch's balance: one overpowered character can easily warp the entire metagame around them. But since LoL has so many different working parts, there's no question who has the better balance team.","

I have said it on Warcraft forums but as long as gamers go buy games based on ''hype'' this will happen.Blizzard as a company ofc cares for the money.It was always like that but in the past at least they cared about their customers.Now what they do only care is their broken ''vision'' to make their games more ''New Player'' friendly and bring even more players in to their games that as we saw from Warcraft is not the caseBut the good think is that there are companies out there that can take your respect with what they release.For example my all time favorite game is Disohored.A game that has 3 DLC that are 3 complete defferent stories from the main game and its worth every Euro you Spend.,"

"A quote, from a friend of mine who I honestly hate playing comp with. He plays pretty religiously at night, in this season alone he has 80+ hours on zenyatta, close to 150+ total for this season. Whenever I look at my friend leaderboard, he averages 2900s, season high was around 3100. The reason he thinks he deserves to be master is that he is simply stuck in that pit of people around 3000sr. There are many people who think they deserve to be way higher than they are, but I brought this guy up, because he is the definition of it. In reality, I do see him belonging around high plat/low diamond, expecially with his win/loss ratio being around 50% and he played nearly 700 games of it and has been averaging the same rank, all season long.","

Yeah no question. But that's a very, very small percentage. At this point in Comp, you're probably where you belong or very near to it. Try calming your ego down a bit.Personally, I think I'm low Diamond. I get tilted, I make bad decisions, I overextend, but when I'm calm and having a good time, I think I play at about a 3000 level. But if we account for all the time I spend tunnel-visioning, getting angry, and asking what the hell my team is thinkng, I think my high of 2760 is accurate.If I wanna be Master or GM, I'll have to do what everyone who talks like they're secretly gods will have to do: Identify my flaws, correct them, and adapt to the game better.","

"You’re forced to sit either in front or behind them and pew pew, hopefully more than the enemy team in order to break their barrier. Many heroes are proficient in breaking barriers, like Junkrat or Roadhog, with the only realistic way to keep them up is Defense Matrix and downtime.Now what if Symmetra could repair those barriers? It wouldn’t be healing, as it’s not used on your teammates themselves, simply Rein, Orisa, and Winston barriers. Each time one of Symmetras full orbs passes through a teammates barrier, it has 125 health replenished. She already works well in a barrier heavy comp, but shield gen doesn't help tanks that much. This would give Symmetra an alternative utility to supporting her team.Just a thought. It would definitely need to be tested and adjusted as 125 shield health every few seconds doesn’t actually sound that impactful considering the nature, charge time, and travel speed of Syms orbs.Also, while Symmetra has a shield generator active and people are in its radius, shield health gains a 1 second delay before recharging as opposed to 3 seconds, giving her more synergy with Zenyatta and Zarya.","

"Your first paragraph there states the problem with barriers. They slow the game down to a siege-type experience. Repairing barriers would exacerbate this problem, not alleviate it.A better solution is to have more niche heroes be able to get around barriers.For instance, what would the game look like if Symmetra could mb1 through barriers, just like her mb2 does? She's already considered weak, so this would be a solid buff. She'd still have to get very close range, but it would be a way to really punish DVA/Orisa/Rein comps that are trying to rely on hiding behind thousands of health worth of barriers before you can even target the enemies behind them.","

"02/20/2018 11:31 AMPosted by seapeeno thanks , i cant imagine how bastion orisa sym would be.Coming from an Orisa main I’m surprised lol. Symmetra already works well in that comp. Bastion deals with Winston. If there’s no Winston, Sym can turret the payload behind the Orisa barrier.It appears the other people commenting don’t really play shield tanks. In my experiences Junkrat+Hog nullifies a barrier extremely quickly, forcing Rein/Orisa back and stalling a push or giving the enemy ground. Symmetra repairing them would give her a credible way to really help her team push or defend when your shield tank is in a pinch. And as I said, it’s 125 health every 2-5 seconds (depending on Syms positioning). Junkrat can spam 120 damage much much faster than that.","

She’d be able to heal a shield far too much if she were pumping a constant 120 hps to the shield. I’m saying only her orbs, which would be a meager 125 extra health for each full, slow charging, slow traveling orbs.","

"Every healer provides that little Sustain, so the team can survive the next wave.Sym can't provide that by herself.If Dev's don't want her to heal.... OK then.But She needs to replace the lost Health with Something (like Shields), during the natural game. (Aka not with her ult(s).)Else other heroes are currently more of a Support then she is.

"I think the simplest solution that avoids a second rework is if she could just get both of her ults running simultaneously.Fill up her Ult once, place either the Tele or Generator.Fill it up again and set down the one you haven't placed yet.If one is destroyed, go back to step 2. If both, back to step 1.That would be plenty of psuedo-sustain. Possibly excessively so, Assuming the enemy team refuses to find and destroy her buildings, at which point it's their own fault.","

"What they could do is buff her basic kit/ give her a new supportive E such as a barrier that fills in up to 150 missing HP with light blue shields that can be healed like empty health and disappear, getting pushed out and replaced by their normal HP as they are healed so it won't count as their Max HP. Just 1 example, there's so many interesting things Blizzard could do with her kit due to her hard-light bending theme.","

"I think they should give her decaying shields on a channeled system. They could play with the values on the decay and shield channeling, but it's a form of in combat sustain that doesn't take a healers spot out of combat, so two supports would still be necessary.There are also other ways to balance it, such as either a resource meter or ammo, and they could move sentries to secondary weapon.","

"I see a lot of talk about a hanzo rework. I enjoy playing hanzo as he is. My profile will tell you that. I never want him to change. Sadly i have no control over that. I do have an idea for a rework even though i don’t want it. People complain a lot about his scatter shot. I personally don’t use it too much but i can see where it would get annoying. My idea is replacing his scatter shot with a self healing ability. He carries around some sake so he could use that to recover some health quickly. A potential problem i can see with this are hanzo getting hit and running away for a few seconds and then coming back fully healed. He could be invincible if you play it right. To counter this i think it would be fair to limit the amount of uses the ability has per life to maybe something around 5 or 6 and make the cooldown 30 seconds. It would give him a little bit more durability without making him op. Im not really sure how much it would heal him for but im sure someone could figure that out. Let me know what you think and if you have any ideas of your own, feel free to tell me.","

This is at the trade off of not having Discord orb or Speed boost.","

"One thing that bugs me and that I've heard others complain about is that Ana is a sniper who doesn't have access to most perches. My idea to fix was initially to give bio nade a knockback to only Ana so she could ""nade jump"" to some perches, but since her nade is just a glass jar that shatters on impact, I have a very similar idea that fits better. Ana's nade would give her a slight jump increase if she jumps on the grenades impact or very soon after. This would make more sense, like whatever biotic fluid is in her grenade gives her more strength in her legs for a very short period. This would allow her to reach perches that you can only reach through rocket jumps. It would increase her skill cap, because you would have to know when to save your nade for healing/damage or to get a better position, or perhaps all three in some rare situations.","

The way I would use it if it ever came to be, is getting onto a perch before a match started, or when the enemy team is mostly dead and not actively pushing.","

"Every support in this game is far too strong at what they do. They're able to reverse high-skill damage and deny the highest skill ultimates in the game by just pressing a single button. This is far too unfair for a personal skill-based FPS like Overwatch. This needs to be changed.Here're the reasons why all the supports need a nerf:1. Healing is OPWhen I finally land my first shuriken 3 minutes into the match, it shouldn't be able to be reversed by a no-aim healer. That ruins the fun of having great accuracy and reflexes. When my grenades deal some high-skill, perfectly aimed damage to someone I couldn't see, they shouldn't be able to gain that health back. That doesn't make any sense, and is extremely overpowered.When I land a perfect hit on an enemy with my 10th shot that took great aim and patience, it shouldn't be able to be reversed by a low-skill brainless healer that just holds left click or pressed one button. Even Ana, who has to ""aim"" gets help with larger hitboxes on allies. This is extremely biased towards support players and makes my life as a DPS much harder. When I spam all of my shots into the enemy Roadhog and hit him 20% of the time, he never dies because he's getting pocket healed! How am I supposed to kill an AFK Roadhog that's getting pocketed by a Mercy? Healing shouldn't beat damage, especially not in an FPS! They need nerfs!My proposal is to drastically reduce the effectiveness of healing by 99%. This would make it far easier for me to reach Top 500 without having the enemy with a solo healing Mercy deny all of my epic kills by holding left click. This will teach those support mains to git gud and play some actual skill-based heroes like Junkrat!2. They Shouldn't Deal DamageThe support DPS meta needs to end! Look at Moira, for example. And Zenyatta. And even Ana! She isn't a real sniper! They shouldn't be able to get gold eliminations and damage on a team of 5 pro DPS mains! Their only focus should be on healing, not on stealing all of the kills with their low skill damage abilities. Moira and Symmetra don't even need to aim! And they both have abilities that don't aim! They can kill me in 6 seconds before I can land my first shot, so they need to have their damage removed. They aren't DPS, they shouldn't get kills.The worst part is when I use my extremely hard to use mobility abilities to flank the enemy team, and then when I try to kill the supports, they kill me! How is this fair? I'm supposed to be Grandmaster, but a bronze Mercy can kill me with her pistol! How is this fair!? They're all far too overpowered and deserve heavy nerfs. No support should be able to out damage a DPS pro like myself. Take away all their damage abilities and weapons. They should only be able to heal, and shouldn't be able to defend themselves when I go to kill them.3. They Deny My POTGWhen there's 1 minute left in the match and I finally get my first ultimate, there should be no way for a no-skill support player to prevent me from getting a teamkill. When my super hard to use RIP-Tire goes to get a teamkill, and stupid AFK Lucio shouldn't be able to press Q and prevent me from getting my POTG. When I use Dragonblade, the Zenyatta shouldn't be able to deny me the team kill that I deserve just by pressing Q, when I have to move and aim and swing my sword to deal damage! Their ultimates are far too strong, and should be reworked. Lucio should just give everyone +1% speed for 2s, Zenyatta should be killable and heal for only 10 HP/s, and Mercy shouldn't be able to fly. This would make my high skill ultimates be able to get far more kills and help me carry my team to Top 500.Please consider these changes, Blizzard. Supports are far too strong in this game, and all of them need to be nerfed into the ground. My damage should go uncontetsed, as it takes far more skill to use than pressing one button as a support. Thanks for ruining my FPS by adding these no skill heroes into the game that make it so hard to kill stuff.TL;DR: Stop asking for nerfs to supports. They're allowed to do their job, and they're allowed to defend themselves. Keep nerfing them, and you won't have any on your team anymore.","

"@ 2, this is my biggest gripe. If there was no class distinction in OW (Defense, Tank, Support, Offense) it would be so much healthier.Simply because a hero is in the support category every uneducated player thinks that means they shouldn't be able to get kills and heal. This is an FPS game, yes they should. The key thing is the trade-off. If they are dealing damage, they aren't healing their team (save for Zen but outside his ult his heals are very low so it's fair).If you get outplayed by a support, don't cry ""nerf,"" instead learn their counters and adapt.","

"I've played three games today:Game #1 - Temple of AnubisOn attack, legitimately the other five people DPS locked (Soldier, Genji, Hanzo, Pharah, Junkrat) so I was left either choosing to tank or heal. I picked Lucio to try to keep everyone healed the best I can, and was continually berated for not healing good enough, so I get on mic and say ""hey, we've got five DPS with low health pools, no tanks to absorb damage, and one healer, I'm not sure what you want"" and then I was ""reported"" for throwing for not healing good enough or whatever. We didn't get a tick. Got railed the next round on defense.Game #2 - JunkertownThree of us in voice chat were trying to run that cheesey pirate ship strategy with Bastion/Orisa/Rein on the payload. Other three players ran Widow/Hanzo/Genji the entire game. Refused to switch. We had to alter our strategy and got absolutely drilled.Game #3 - LijangSame deal as above. Nobody wanted to heal or tank. Had a Widow the entire game that maybe got one or two picks. Had a Mei trolling us with walls. Two quick and easy sweeps by the other team since we were pretty much playing 6v4.Don't understand why these nine year old kids think this is funny. They're screeching on the mic demanding to play Hanzo or Widow and defending themselves while doing so, even though they are awful and getting hard countered.Competitive isn't even fun on this game anymore, which is a shame.

"Now I think we can all agree that the skins where Orisa’s eyes don’t show (aka Null Sector and Immortal) are pretty bad (opinion). Orisa needs a new skin but is should show her eyes, her eyes are a big chunk of her personality and I die a little each time she gets a new skin and it doesn’t show her eyes. It also takes the personality out of her emotes, especially the laughing emote and the puppy emote. The idea is a unicorn skin, now here me out before you just call this off as a stupid idea. Her body color is a nice bright white, she has a horn coming out of her forehead (obviously) and has a rainbow colored main running down the top of her, and her gun shoots different colored shots (or whatever that green ammo is). I think this could be a pretty good skin for the Anniversary event considering the skins aren’t related to anything just skins that would look good on the hero, like Genji’s Sentai skin and Bastion’s dune buggy skin. But yeah as long as the skin shows her eyes I think it could be pretty cool.","

"The problems with suggesting like this are the things that we don't think about. I mean take a look at how Doomfist was designed to work. He has the ability to do a large burst of damage with the use of his rocket fist. The other parts of his kit allow him a good engage/disengage. Because of how powerful his kit is, it is important — for balance reasons — that his health pool is lower. Look at Tracer for example. She has insane mobility and sustain with the use of her abilities. This is why she has a tiny health pool. The reason that Doomfist has 250 is due to the non-reliable way to restore health. He can generate shields by hitting people with his abilities, but this is not as reliable as something like recall or biotic field. This means that he needs the extra 50 HP.His job is to go in, get a pick, get out, and repeat. He has a health pool that fits this role well. The important thing to keep important is not wasting his abilities so that you always have a way out.","
						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"That, or let him gain 50 HP per enemy hit with his passive instead of 30. That way he can actually fully exploit it and get the full 150 HP in one rotation, which makes him sufficiently tanky to survive. Right now you only really get to 400 HP if you ult and hit at least 2 people. Kind of underwhelming that you need to ult to use your passive to its full extent.","

"You know, paying something still makes you agree to that something's policy.By your logic, you can watch and do horrible things or absolutely illegal things on the internet because you pay for it.You can destroy physical objects you own without much troubles.(Don't know about every countries, but in mine you still need an authorization from your city to alter the home you own, so even owning an house has some rules you must follow.)But something online with policies does not fall into that category.","

"Without smurfs elo hell would really be just a mind thing. And if you played every game with all 12 players on their main account, you would averagely climb if you deserved better rank.Season 2 was great example, everyone was at their rank they deserved mostly. It was the most accurate season by far, because smurfs used to be still rare back then. I had alt account back then and i climbed to 3800 (my average rank) pretty much insantly.Now its not longer like this. There are smurfs everywhere especcially on consoles. So if you play better then your rank with 55% of winrate lest say, you should climb right? No, just a bit of unluck of getting 4k SR smurf hiding behind 3k in enemy team instead of your team in few games and your real 55% winrate is smashed under 50%. You get my point. I was placed lowest ever this season, 3400, was playing between GMS/Top 500 since S1-S7. Started climbing in straight wins back, 100% winrate with Soldier, 6kd, 6 wins, you can see it in stats and these games were pretty much just stomp so i can get higher, where i used to be, 1st loss? Yes, you guessed it, my GM friend on lvl 40 alt 3500 against me and i lost that fight.I mean Elo hell isnt really elo hell, its more like elo time, if i played 100h this season i would be around 3800 rank, with that much time i would outcome the unlucky/lucky odds. If someone has 100+h on a season i still believe his rank is kinda accurate.Just my point is that not everyone have so much time and it takes too long to adjust SRs properly mainly due to smurfs. And with every season it takes more and more time to adjust ranks because of that. Maybe hard reset after s10 would be cool refreshment? There will be much less smurfs because main account would wan to get their rank back. But i guess there is nothing Blizz can do against it.","

I dunno about S2, pretty much everyone at high elo i know is first checking S2 rank of the players. Of course that many players couldimprove a lot, but S2 rank of the players always reflected the performance afterwards by far the bestfor me, but just my experience.S3 was still great in terms of matchmaking and SRs ratings, imo everything started to fall like a house of cards since S4 and never really recovered.","

"According to the last interview that Jeff Kaplan had in regards of hanzo, he clearly stated that scatter arrow is a problem, but nerfing it will make hanzo completely useless at all times. He also mentioned that the team's reaction is usually negative towards picking hanzo such as ""could you please switch off hanzo? we don't need him."". Another thing he said that usually there are almost never occassions where the team says: ""oh, we need a hanzo to counter them"" because mostly hanzo is an inconsistent character, and doesn't help the team in any given meta. i looked at the hunter class from World of Warcraft, and was influenced with 2 abilities that could be put in hanzo's kit that would make him more viable and fun in this meta.before i talk about the 2 new abilities, i'd like to state that hanzo might need a projectile speed increase so that he's more consistent with his shots. maybe a 15% projectile speed increase.ability 1: Explosive Shot ""E"" 12 seconds cooldown: (no more scatter arrow)Hanzo fires an explosive shot that deals 50 damage on impact, and knocks enemies back. this ability is a great way of making hanzo survive more, especially against dive comps when hanzo is controlling the higher grounds. if genji dashes up to him, or a winston leaps to him, he could just use his explosive shot on the ground to knock them off the higher grounds.ability 2: Freezing Arrow ""right mouse button"" 12 seconds cooldown:Hanzo fires a freezing shot, dealing 75 damage on impact, putting the receiving end in an ice block for 4 seconds with 125 health. the frozen target is unable to move during the duration of the freeze, and is immune to damage taken until the 4 seconds are over, or if the ice is broken by either teams.i believe that this ability would make him a more fun character, and suit him more in a ""defense"" role. he could be a great fit in countering dive meta's, especially when they dive the healers in the back line, hanzo could freeze them, and maybe even knock them off the map!please let me know what you think, i really hope i could get a response from the developers.","

"I'm not sure either of these would be very helpful to his gameplay style. He's mid-range, really, due to his arrow arc & projectile speed. He needs some up close abilities that can both increase his survivability and also deal with enemies. People have been using Scatter for this, and while that is not the intended use of the skill, it has turned into this. A 'panic button' sort of deal. Anything people come up with that doesn't deal damage or have a utility (such as a slow or stun - something he can follow up w/ damage) isn't going to go over well. He needs better mobility if they can find out some way to add it in without making him fly all over the place. Perhaps a more reliable wall climb? He gets stuck on ledges and windows often, and falls down with a little 'oompf'. Would be nice if he just ignores that sort of geometry on the map.Also I feel like his ULT likely needs some help because if you pop it right in front of an enemy, the dragons pass through that person without hurting them whatsoever. They don't seem to work till about 5 meters out. I'm unsure what to do to his scatter to make it 1) more reliable for the user and 2) not so awful to play against/die to.","

And to be clear, I'm talking about THIS week only according to Overbuff. https://www.overbuff.com/heroes#Moira is the highest picked character across silver to GM, and her Winrate goes up the higher up the ranks you go.Seriously, she's got a 55% Winrate in GM, despite over 10% pickrate.In Masters, she's got a Winrate a bit lower then Diamond - 53.32 compared to 53.66 - but she's also got a significantly higher pickrate, at 11.55 to 10.75 in Diamond.  So not only is her pickrate nearing what Mercy's was during her hayday (when she was a constant pick on both sides) - her higher then 50% winrate also means that if your team does NOT have a Moira, you're odds of winning drop dramatically.

"Her pickrate started climbing not because she was buffed or anything but because other healers were nerfed. You can see this very clearly on Overbuff, the day Mercy was nerfed, Moira climbed like 4% in pickrate. Before that, she was at 6-7% which is a very neutral pickrate for a healer. It's not too high and also not too low.So no, her pickrate is not too high because she's OP but because other healers got nerfed too much. Buff the other healers and she'll lose some ground. Many Mercy mains switched to Moira because she's currently just better than Mercy thanks to the recent nerfs.","
						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"Moira isn't too strong, it's her main competition of Ana and Mercy that are not as attractive anymore that's the issue.Mercy is still sttong in pure healing and damage buffing, but with her ress nerf people have become less interested in her, as her playatyle is rather basic and passive over the potential damage assist from Moira.Ana suffers under not being able to heal through shields, which is a big issue when Winston and Orisa are hard to avoid, and could likely do with some help to give her better positioning. The lack of mobility and the shield issue keeps her as a less attractive alternative to someone like Moira.Moira's pickrates are high because - even if she haves no utility to bring - she is the most enganging, stabile main healer we have. She is balanced to perfection, where her competition is lacking behind, so she is naturally taken more often.What is needed to equalize this is not to nerf her, but to make Ana and Mercy a little better.Personally, I'd suggest Ana got a healing buff to her primary, 2 more bullets, and wall climb. She is a sniper, and should be able to get into position to take advantage of that. It wouldn't be bad to give her an out of combat self heal like Mercy either, so she doesn't need to use the grenade in herself half the time.As for Mercy, there have been a lot of suggestions about earning the ress, and then still having the single target, instant cast when the requirements are met. I agree on this, and think some sort of *heal to earn extra lives* mechanic can be done well, long as there is a maximum of one stored charge. Otherwise we are going to return to the pre-nerf problem again.","

"Also you have to remember there are only 5 healers, 3 main healers; ana, mercy and ana and 2 side healers; lucio and zen. The fact is there is not a lot of choice for healers atm. When there are 14 dps the stats on specific heroes may seem fine, but there are 14 heroes to choose from so the pickrate is spread over those 14, however in the healers case, there is only 3 main healers to choose between and 1 main healer is always better than the other 2 purely because of the meta. Ana is good against tanky comps with not too many shields but is terrible against dive as she is countered by flankers and dva and winstonMercy is weak in a tank meta as she doesnt provide enough heals to sustain the health of her team but is good in a meta when heroes such as widow who rely on picks are strong as she can revert those picks and when high mobile heroes like pharah and genji are good as she can easily heal them compared to ana and moira plus use them as an escape toolMoira is very good in a deathball comp where everyone is grouped up and you all push together but struggles when your team are spread out due to the nature of her heal resource meterA main healer will always be more picked than the others until they vary the category up by putting more healers that can contest the already established 3.","

The fact that rezing in valkyrie is a death sentence killed mercy. FACT. It should be 1 instant rez during valk to make it powerful plus make rez earnable so that good mercy can get it in ~20-25 seconds while bad mercys will take 40+ seconds. Gives the hero skill while making her ult actually useful2) keep daydreaming, ana is useless atm due to the dominance of dva and winston both of which block all her abilities plus her primary fire making her useless. Until ana can either shoot through barriers at 50% effectiveness ot the meta drastically shifts, which it is but moira is better than ana, ana will be useless. She is a high skilled hero with literally no extra reward compared to other healers.3) try solo healing with lucio, see how long your tanks last. 4) zen is extremely powerful but not as a healer as an extra dps who heals innthe background, his healing much like lucios is secondary to their utility of discord and speed boost. That is why you pick them not for their healing.","

Mercy has nosedived down to 2.4% in GM and is still quite low across all ranks and Moira’s at about 12.5% up from around 10%.

"I actually just made a post slightly similar to this.02/20/2018 09:46 AMPosted by ShadeI understand what you're saying. Not all Mercy or Moira mains are contributing to making posts like ""Tracer/Genju/Dps are trash"" ""Learn to aim you're not skilled"", but upvotes don't lie and people would be fibbing if they said they didn't upvote those types of posts against Benji and downvote similar posts about Moira.What I always find interesting is that the complaints that people have against Gengu are basically the same complaints that people have against Moira. They are both characters who have very forgiving kits especially when compared to the counterparts for their roles and people claim both of them are OP when they're not. Jenga with his generous deflect and dash hitboxes and Moira with her generous aim hitbox and self heal on right click and low mobility cooldown. Bad Genji's and bad Moira's are frequent overextenders and can be a massive liability for their team. People playing against them feel like they offer too much value for too little work statwise and players playing as them say that the characters take much more skill than people realize.  It's basically the same situation but the people are born into different ""countries"" or ""races"". It's just some people are so entrenched in their support or dps tribalism that it would cause them to say Gengar is bad while Moira is good for a very similar scenario.","

"Ana ate a nerf forever ago which allowed the Triple Tank to die but it was replaced with a meta that heavily cripples her and thus she's a tremendously underwhelming option. Mercy got a rework that was largely unpopular with support players and caused a massive upheaval in team compositions, and was then the target of a series of nerfs that have left her mostly balanced but incredibly boring. Lucio suffered from the ult changes in that he MUST use his ult in dangerous situations but it's incredible cast time combined means there's ample time for a stun/hook or death to occur. He gets significantly less value from an ult now. He's also succumbing to powecreep and the Sombra buffs are going to be really hard on him.So I think a lot of the hostility supports have when DPS adk for Moira nerfs is rooted in the fact that overall the healing roster is in a less than ideal place. It's ESPECIALLY annoying coming from Tracer/Genji mains who have 1) enjoyed sustained presence in the longest running meta and 2) largely seem to be /headtilt when told that Moira is perhaps better left to a Soldier or tank.","

"It’s true that win rate is a bit more confusing in OW than other games, because you can pick multiple heroes and both sides can have the same one. Still, a pick with both high win rate and high play rate seems to be an indicator that it’s too strong (high play rate is important, else you get situations like sym / torb that are only played by champion enthusiasts, the same phenomenon is seen in LoL for example). Take pre-nerf mercy for example, her win rate was around 53-54%, and she was quite strong / impactfut (I know this is just a correlation). I assume that in games where both sides have the same hero, it contributes nothing towards win rate (one win one loss), so win rate seems to be an indicator of what happens when only one side has the hero, roughly.","

"Hey guys, just an idea I had for a new type of game mode, ""2-Way Payload"":- Imagine a map which looks something like a ""V""(so the 2 main corridors are in that shape), with the payload at the bottom. The teams start top right and top left, fight to gain control of the payload, and push it towards the enemy's spawn/camp/goalline. - Teams have to capture the payload at first, similar to a control/payload map. Then, to reverse direction, the opposing team must ""steal"" the payload (stand on payload without enemy/controlling team for X seconds).- If you get it to the other side you win, or after a set time, whoever pushed it onto the other team's side wins. If a player who *doesn't* possess the payload, stands on it, we go into overtime. - If it goes into overtime, whichever team manages to get it on the opposite side without enemy team on payload, wins(or to the goal line).Thoughts, improvements, complaints?I love payload, it's just so damn exciting, but some don't, because 1 team has to be on ""Defense"". I don't care much for Control, but people like it because both teams are on ""Attack"". I feel like this is a mode which could address both issues, and be all around pretty exciting. Also in the interest of balancing, perhaps the map's corridors could look more like an upside down ""A"", to allow for quicker travel when the payload nears a ""goal line"".","

"TL;DR - There is no such thing as group reports being individualized, and large stacks of players may enforce their own brand of justice in Overwatch by picking on solo players by reporting them and relying on the automated system to punish them.First off - I want to address the claim that ""one or more players from a group counts as a single report"" - this is absolutely NOT true. Whoever has spread this lie has no idea how the system works.Next, I want to talk about the critical vulnerability in the reporting system.Because bans are automated (meaning, you accrue X reports and you get banned), stacks of players may govern Overwatch via rule by mob. IE, you, as someone who may be outside a stack of players, (ie, a single player in a game with a 4 or 5 stack), are made vulnerable to this. If you do not behave as the stack dictates ""eg - heal us, dont use that ult, do X, don't pick this character"", they can exact retribution on solo players for not doing exactly as they say.","

"There should be a limit on how many reports a player can file before they themselves get looked at very closely.If someone is consistently reporting someone in every game for poor teamwork, it's likely they are the one that is the problem.Perhaps there should be a weighting system where the more reports a player files in a month, the less each individual report is worth from them during the month after.i.e in January a player reported three people. In February their reports have more weight because it is clear they only rarely report people.A different player reports 200 people in January. In February their reports have very little weight because it is clear they are the common denominator.","

The only time a report is reviewed is when a banned player files an appeal.

"PC players have to buy another copy of the game to smurf. Console players do not. They just have to create a new account on their console which is registered with any email and as long as one version of the game has been bought, it can then be played by all those accounts.This is not something Blizzard has any control of. It has everything to do with Sony/MS game sharing policies. I make good use of this policy, I pay $70/year for my Xbox live gold and I only have to buy one version of every game so that both my bf and I can enjoy the same game. Rather than play them separately, we can now enjoy games together, be they pvp games or online co-op games. It saves families a lot of money, and it's a good policy.With that said, what they can do to minimize the amount of smurfing, is instead of allowing accounts to be created with emails (which can be almost infinite), is to force any new accounts to be tied to a working phone number. They text you a pin or code to that phone number and you use that code to register the account. To be clear, I'm not a fan of this idea, I'm fine with how it currently is, I've not noticed smurfs, but since it does appear to be a growing issue, I think this policy change would allow for the game sharing aspect on consoles to remain, while minimizing the amount of free accounts someone can make.","

"The big defense I hear about Mercy's rez ( This isn't a Mercy rez topic btw don't turn it into one please ) Is that Mercy used her resurrection type abilities to bring back Jack and Reyes after OverWatch Hq was destroyed. I've been on a lore binge the past couple of days, cuz I'm all snowed in and have nothing better to do, and I've found 0 evidence supporting these claims. In fact, there is no mention of Mercy resurrecting people in the lore at all. Morrison faked his death to go undercover as Soldier 76, and Reaper got genetically enhanced, presumably by Moira. Where are people getting the idea that Mercy resurrected them?","

"Reyes and Morison didn’t get in a physical fight. Their friendship ended when Morison was chosen to be strike commander of overwatch even though Reyes could’ve been selected instead. Supposedly, they were both present at the Swiss overwatch hq that got accidentally destroyed, and both of them “died” there.It’s much more likely that Moira was the one to turn Reyes to Reaper, but it’s not confirmed. In her origins short, she seems to know what she’s doing to Reyes when purple smoke comes out of him. There’s an in-game interaction between Mercy and Reaper where she asks him “what happened to you ?”; so if her Rez experiment failed, she would’ve known and not asked that question.","

"We need more lore period. This game was built to be open ended and I really love that, but I wish they'd start shoving stuff into the gaps. Every time there's new lore I end up really liking it. Regardless of if it retcons anything, it's always interesting and adds depth to already great characters.Like the Uprising comic was a great example. Originally Reaper was built to be vindictive due to being looked over for a promotion. But as Reyes was built as a character, that didn't work. What would've miffed him more was exactly what happened in Uprising; politics getting in the way of the mission. This gives him way more depth and explains him in a way more realistic way.This is what good character development looks like. It almost writes itself when you have good characters. Moira brought up more questions than answers in regards to Reaper. I'm just desperate for more lore as a result.","

Reaper is a sarcastic person despite his tragic condition, he is ironic, he uses sarcasm (for example, when he taunted Winston by telling him that he was going to 'send his regards to his friends' -i.e. kill them-). It is likely that Reaper simply meant to tell Mercy: 'Aren't you supposed to be one of the best doctors in the world? Tell me what happened to me!'.","

"Did Gabriel Reyes suffer from genetic issues before meeting Moira? Those abilities from Moira were useful for his role in Blackwatch: it's handy to turn into shadow if you want to stay undetected. But, knowing Moira, her treatment could be unstable or having unintended effects.If Soldier Enhancement Program itself was flawed, then why Soldier 76 remained normal? Just a theory, on what happened in Overwatch HQ: both Jack and Gabriel were on edge due to protests outside, and their argument turned into fight. Gabriel used his abilities for combat, not for stealth, like before. First ever Death Blossom was reason for that explosion, but as result, Gabriel became Reaper - he no longer could return to his normal form. Jack was nimble enough to avoid severe injuries and faked his death.","

"Heyo.  I played Rein solo queue into top 500 s1 and GM season 3 and 4, now I usually just quick play for fun.  Reinhardt is why I bought overwatch from beta and he's primarily why I still play.  Despite him having been riddled with bugs (many of which I like to think I helped fix!), he's one of a kind and I love playing him.  However, with the introduction of new heroes and a shifting meta, he's fallen off a bit.  First I'll talk about why exactly, and then I'll suggest a few changes.First lets talk about the weird robo cow thing in the room - Orisa.  She's in a lot of ways pooped all over Reinhardt's place in the game.  Her shield, while only being 800 HP, is generally better.  It's more flexible and versatile among other things, especially since she isn't foced into comitting to keeping it active like Rein is.  She can apply a ton of pressure with her ranged fire, especially shield pressure... shredding apart Reinhardt for instance.  Her immovable stance also hard counter's reinhardt's charge and blocks his earthshatter from hitting her or targets behind her.  Generally speaking, Orisa is a nightmare to deal with as Rein and in the current meta she does his job better than he does his job.Then of course just about every new hero since release brought something new to really make Rein harder to play.  Ana's anti-heal / sleep dart to interrupt his charge or ult.  Doomfist charge beats out Rein's charge entirely, Moira straight up doesn't care about shields and has two abilities that go right through them, and finally Sombra, while not currently meta, soon will be and she's an absolute nightmare.  With a quicker hack time to drop Rein's shield, and to stop Rein mid-charge on his way to a pin, it's going to be even harder to play Rein in the coming weeks.  This isn't even to mention that her EMP straight shatters his 2000 HP shield and leaves him with nothing else.So in summation - where is Reinhardt falling short in today's meta?1) Other shield characters, namely Orisa, have a more versatile and reliable shield that regenerates while already in use.  Reinhardt's shield needs to be down for a few seconds before it begins to regenerate at all.2) too many characters can interrupt his ability to charge, taking away a lot of the control and reliability of it.  Oddly, the only time a Reinhardt can get much mileage out of charge is in charging other Reinhardts.  Reinhardt for a while has been the most meta because in a very weird way the best counter to Reinhardt is another Reinhardt, but now that Orisa counters Reinhardt arguably more effectively, Reinhardt is being seen a lot less.So what changes might I recommend?1) Reinhardt's shield regenerates MUCH quicker when it is not in use.  Currently it takes 2 seconds to begin regenerating, I suggest bringing that all the way down to .75 seconds and increasing the rate of regeneration from 195 to 245 per second.  Increase Reinhardt's backward movement speed to 3.5 while his shield is active.  Allowing him to play a poke and retreat game would stay true to his identity and enhance his style of play quite a bit.  I'd love to see him move a bit faster forward as well, but I'm fine with that not being the case.  The trouble with the poke game as of current is that you poke, get low, shield and start backing up, then the enemy just runs through your shield to shoot you.  Maybe even allowing Rein's barrier the unique property of not allowing enemies to pass through it could be interesting to try out?2) Allow for more control over charge.  I suggest giving reinhardt the ability to press 'shift' again to stop his charge, and I would recommend giving him resistance to knockback and stun effects while charging.  What this means is that effects like lucio's boop would still knock back, but not quite as far.  Stun effects, like flash bang, would still work but would cause Reinhardt to continue a bit of forward momentum for a short distance.  He'd release any target he had picked up, and any targets he ran into thereafter would be knocked back as per charge's secondary hit function.I feel like these changes would make Reinhardt a more valuable pick once again and allow him to continue to be represented in a changing meta.  If my suggestions seem too radical, the summarized points I'd make are that Reinhardt really needs his shield to regenerate faster, and he could really use some resistance to CC while charging.  CC effects have gotten so out of control especially on new heroes that against decent players charging almost guarentees you're just going to be made a fool of and then die.","

"Zen's whole shtick is he can defend himself; Why he's the only other balanced supportLucio's damage is a bit harder to use, since it's in volleys. Lucio CAN fight back, but his lack of easy to hit consistant damage is why it's easier to simply run away or back to your team.Ana is actively punished for defending herself; Burning Sleep Dart leaves you open to another dive for 12 seconds, using your Grenade burns your best utility and ONLY self heal, and shooting at an enemy loses you precious ammo.Mercy is usually attached to someone, WITH the benefit of her heal target able to see her health, as well as callouts when she is attacked.Moira has no downsides to defending herself; she NEEDS to attack to gain resource to heal.Every other support except Zen has easier times escaping, or are punished for trying.Also the BIG thing, you can't Deflect or Defense Matrix her primary attack; the only thing that can block it is barriers. Genji can't turn the fight into his favour because he deflected a Biogrenade that the Ana threw at her feet.","

Why can Junkrat cancel his firing animation to throw a mine to instant kill 200 health heroes?3. Because without the reset he would be a sitting duck at an 8 second mobility ability4. Every hero can generate ultimates and Genji's ultimate is only powerful if you know what you're doing with it, it requires so much more actions per minute than almost every other ultimate5. He can block melee damage which I admit is a bit stupid6. I agree them being invisible is ridiculous7. That's just unlucky and Genji knew you were going to shoot, also IIRC deflect bypasses favor the shooter so that's why8. Which is why he's the first hero to be switched off of in dive meta9. 2 passives which is the same amount as Mercy, and amount of passives doesn't change how powerful something is, quality over quantity10. Winston resets his jump while McCree and I believe Soldier reloads11. Junkrat's mine is escape, unavoidable damage, and can close distances, and he has 2 of them!12. Deflect is only as powerful as you make it be, sure the first quarter second you're spraying at him you will get hit but if you see him deflecting you stop attacking, deflect is an ability that the person on the receiving end can make absolutely useless, although I do agree you should be able to melee him while he's deflecting13.

"Mercy main reporting in. Genji is fine except for his deflect hitbox/animation, and the fact that half of his hard counters are F-tier (which is not his fault).Once Mei and Symmetra get the fixes that are already on the way, I suspect Genji will become a LOT less frustrating to deal with.","

"This is heavily inspired by these two threads and I have added my own ideas in there toohttps://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761876286?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758556320?page=1Overview: This rework will give him more versatility and mobility. All modes will be powerful in their own niche. It will give him options and the ability to adapt to the situation.General:Remove ironclad+65 armor.Notes: This will make grenades/rockets/Widow/Hanzo require 4 hits to kill in all modes but doesn't scale with burst damage like damage resist does.Self Heal:remove .5 second delay.Allows healing while reconfiguring.Notes: Self Heal will deploy instantly now. The ability to heal while reconfiguring will allow him to stand up without a death sentence. Normally you'll get trapped in sentry healing yourself until it runs out and if you stand you die.Configuration: Recon:Increased ammo from 25 to 35.Notes: The extra ammo will allow him to provide sustained fire while remaining mobileConfiguration: Sentry:Reduce ammo to 200 from 300Can headshot.reverted spread.Notes: These changes will allow him to be a true tank buster and PharMercy counter and without ironclad, the bonus armor doesn't scale with the damage, he will be much more vulnerable to attack. A pure glass cannon.Configuration: Tank:E slot will now transform you into a less powerful tankmodestats:Footstep sound is the same but loses the piercing ultimate echo.Reconfiguring has the same sound as sentry to recon and recon to sentry without the battle cry.130 damage per shot80 minimum splash damage (Like Phara's rockets, unless I am mistaken.)5 ammo2 second reloadNo self damage (retains self knockback)notes: This will give him more vertical mobility and a skillshot burst weapon with a faster projectile speed than Phara's rockets but he is hampered by barriers as he is stuck on the ground and rocket jumping doesn't get you fully over. This will allow him to engage squishy heroes more effectively but loses the high headshot damage from recon and sentry. The damage is 130 so it will kill a Reaper in 2 direct hitsUltimate: Overclock:Overclocked General:1 - 1.5 second cast timeAll modes gain 185 armor upon activation (equal to 450 total hp with the +65)10 second duration2x swap speed. It'll look super janky but it'll help adapt with his ult.Makes the battlecry sound when ulting. Notes:This will give Bastion the survivability he needs in a fight after he's ulted. It will give him a more hands on feeling instead of just firing rockets from behind your teamates or just hoping you don't get hooked. The swap speed will give him quick access to the modes he needs to adapt to the situation while ultingOverclocked Recon:50% faster move speed.50% faster firerate. 12 bullets per second up from 8Infinite ammo.Overclocked Sentry:Gains immunity to CC.Infinite ammo.Notes: this, coupled with the 450 hp while ulting, will allow him to stand his ground without his team piled on top of him while giving him better suppressing fire.A small note:To switch to recon you push the key of the mode you're in and to switch to one configuration to the other you push the respective key of the one you want to use.Overclocked Tank:Damage increased to 205 per shot.Infinite ammo.No self damage (retains self knockback).Notes:This is just old tank but the no self damage will help him fight up close without just killing himselfConclusion: The point of these changes is to have another mode, and each one has its special niche. Recon for good, sustained mobile hitscan damage, Sentry for killing tanks, barriers, and flying targets as a glass cannon, and tank is good for vertical mobility and a mobile answer to small fast characters with a skillshot cannon with splash. He will be able adapt to the situation and changes his specialty with each mode. His ultimate will enforce those roles even harder and allows faster changing between each one for maximum versatility.","

"Some numbers should probably be tweaked but your ideas are pretty interesting.Still, if Blizzard doesn't want to test these changes on the PTR, they should at least give a try to the following ones:- 150 health + 150 armor instead of 200 health + 100 armourand/or- no 0,5 delay from self healingand/or- 30 rounds mag in recon mode instead of 25and- no self damage from tank modePLEASE Blizz, since you are working on buffs and reworks on the least used heroes (Mei, Torb, Hanzo, Doomfist, Sombra), please address Bastion as well. We don't want it overpowered, just not a troll pick. (Yesterday I was abused in chat once again for trying it in a comp game, and I'm only in plat).","

"Symmetra's lore has never really connected well with her in game character.  She's touted as someone who warps reality, and uses hard-light to create constructs in pursuit of order.  I honestly think Symmetra should be restructured around this concept.  Have her be a battlefield manipulation character.  A support completely centered around constructing deployables to benefit her team or bend the area to her advantage.Left Shift - Sentry: Cycle between 3 different types of deployable sentries. (Max 6 senties, each have 1hp)Sentry Turret - Damaging beam. Deals damage roughly equal to her stage 1 LC.Sentry Trap - Suppressing beam.  Deals minimal damage but greatly reduces speed and prevents movement abilities.Sentry Ward - Support beam.  Rapidly regenerates shields. (Does not restore health)E - Pylon [placeholder name]: Cycle between 3 different supportive structures. (Max 2 pylons at a time)Barrier Pylon - Tower that fires out Photon Barriers every 8-10 seconds.  The same as Sym's current E, but the tower fires it instead of Symmetra. (Tower has 200 Health)Protective Pylon - Tower that creates a protective dome around it.  Like Winston's bubble but smaller.  Dome has 500 health, tower destroyed when dome is broken. Bridge Pylon - Tower that creates a hard-light bridge players can use to cross gaps. (Like the one on Hanamura for example) The bridge has 200 health and the tower is lost if the bridge is destroyed.  Both teams can stand on and damage the bridge.Q - Photon Pad: Cycle between 3 powerful hard-light buildings.Teleporter - Same as currentShield Generator - Same as currentGravity Negator - Deployable that weakens gravity for allies in a medium radius, allowing them to jump much higher than normal.Sym's weapon would basically be the same, however one really cool tweak that I think would be a great balance to how she is now is remove her damage ramp up, but have her turrets fixate on whomever/whatever she's currently locked onto.  That way her damage ramps with her deployables.  You can counteract her stacking damage by removing her turrets, and good Sym players can make this more difficult to do.","

"It's time for some change.I remember first seeing these changes and got really excited for them. When they came live, mercy was super OP. Now they have nerfed her hard and are saying, ""oH yEaH, tHe MeRcY cHaNgEs WeRe A sUcCeSs.""Well, mercy's ult is quite....underwhelming. I have a few ideas on how to fix this. Let me know which one you like the best, or if you have another idea. Or call me a filthy mercy main, your pick.Catagory one: mercy 1.0Solution one: restore old mercy.This is about as simple as it gets. Restore old mercy. However, I think she is still a bit underpowered. I think she should get another ability in addition to a restoration.Solution 2: restoration with new abilityHowever, I think she is still a bit underpowered. I think she should get another ability in addition to a restoration. This would be an ability that grants both benefits of her healing beam to a single target for 3-4 seconds. Has a 10-15 second cool down.Category 2: mercy 2.0Solution 1: buff Valkyrie. Restore the nerf to: Time, Mobilty or Rez(minus the bonus charge).This adds a little more value to the lackluster ultimate it would make it a bit more fun. Solution 2:rework Valkyrie.This one is a bit more radical, but I believe it would work.Valkyrie-change time to 7-10 seconds-restore all nerfs, except bonus Rez charge, which is now a Rez cool down.I believe this would give her ult all of the impact it used to have, but still stay within balance. The Rez cool down would force her to do one normal Rez before her no cool down one.The goal is to give her ult the name ultimate, and have lots of potential like all of the other ults.Earth shattering the entire enemy team is worthy of the ultimate titleUsing sound barrier to save your team from a rip tire is worthy of the ultimate titleMercy sticks on the skybox for 15 seconds, not worthy of the ultimate title.Anyways, please tell me your solutions or if you agreed with one of mine, thanks for reading.===============Hey Lightninggeo,We're going to lock this thread. However, we encourage to continue sharing your feedback on the changes for Mercy in this topic. This is in an effort to consolidate feedback for our team. Additionally, we are moving to new forums soon, so be on the look out for that!Thank you!- Moderation Team","

"So you know how you can leave a game 2 minutes after someone else has left without getting a leavers' penalty? Well at the moment there's a bug where if you do that, if you win your next game you will get next to no SR.This happened to me yesterday. Had a game where someone left. I waited 2 minutes. I wasn't planning on leaving initially but when everyone else on my team left I decided to leave as well; what was the point in staying with nobody else?The next game I played I won, but I only got 2 SR. I researched this and apparently it has been happening to other people.Is this a bug? Because if it is it really needs to be addressed as it's unfairly punishing people for other people's decision to leave. Leavers already don't get punished enough imo, this is just more proof that they screw over the other people on their team more than themselves. If this is an intentional feature then why? It doesn't make sense. Let me repeat that I waited for 2 minutes in case the leaver returned, and when the game said I could leave without incurring a leavers penalty, I left. I lost around 23SR for that game and won 2 SR in my next game. It's ridiculous.","

The Moria gets a message to switch to a main healer. It makes no sense. We see he isn't getting kills. Our team compares medals and he had no medals for damage or Elims. Lucio had Bronze. I know medals mean very little but my Lord... how do you look at your screen and see 0 medals and blame everyone else? Why not take accountability?","

"Here's a list of all of Doomfist's counters:Tracer (Dodges his punches and attacks easily, he uses a projectile gun which Tracer can dodge easily, his hitbox is the perfect size for her guns)Genji (A counter in that Doomfist literally can't touch him since he doublejumps over every attack and can just whittle Doomfist down)Orisa (A hero that's literally made to hard counter Doomfist, her cannon is able to spray into his body easily and Fortify makes her immune to all of his attacks)Reaper (Shotgun hero vs. melee hero with no armour)Roadhog (Shotgun hero vs. melee hero with no armour)Bastion (Doomfist can't do anything vs. him. Sentry mows him down.)Widowmaker (PLINK you're dead before you can do anything because your hitbox is ridiculously huge)Hanzo (His horizontal leap and Volley make any Doomfist pretty much dead when fighting him. Even in his current state, Doomfist is still easy to hit as Hanzo.)McCree (Stun, plink, plink.)Pharah (Doom is ridiculously easy to direct hit, and Doom literally can't reach her. Don't show me the clip of Chipsa killing a Pharah because that requires great amounts of effort and can be dodged anyway if the Pharah uses her shift.)Junkrat (A steel trap disables a skyscraper-destroying gauntlet. Who'd have thunk it. Easily hits Doomfist in his spray-and-pray.)Torbjorn (Armour makes you unable to one hit kill him, you can't do anything vs. his turret, his shotgun works wonders against you)Zenyatta (Discord turns Doomfist into a 175 HP hero with a hitbox the size of Zarya. Zeny can 1v1 a Doomfist with difficulty but Zeny's team can easily melt Doomfist.)Sombra (Hack turns him into a 250 HP tank-sized character with a terrible gun.)15 counters on one hero- if two or more of these are on a team (which they will be- Zenyatta, Junkrat, Pharah, McCree and Tracer are all common hero picks) then Doomfist can't do anything.Tell me again why Doomfist doesn't need even a minor buff?","

"This list is very, VERY exaggerated. Some true, some not, some kinda.Yes he has quite a few counters, but not like your list. Tracer - Isnt really a counter, per se, but thats more a duel that comes down to skill from either players. NO one says, ah they got a Doomfist, someone go Tracer. She can be a pest for him though defo.Genji - No. Genji doesnt counter him.. lol. Deflect is useless against Doom, and again this comes down to skill from either players, just a matter of who outplays who.Orisa - Yes. 100%. Its a shame people cried for nerfs for DF when they introduced a hero thats basically literally design DF in any way, straight afterwards.Reaper - Eh, its a weird one. I can ruin reapers they can ruin me. Again, more of a duel. I can use RP to bait out Wraith then Slam and Uppercut to end him, or he can just two shot me in the process.Hog - Yes. lol.Bastion - Yes.Widowmaker - This is a tricky one, because Doom can ruin immobile heroes, but if a widow keeps her distance, and snipe then yeah, but then again if you can reduce that distance significantly shes yours. But I can defo see Widow being a counter to him and visa versa. Again, comes to down to the skill of the players.Hanzo - not so much as Widow, and his immobility and projectile shots make it so it can be avoided to an extent, but usually DF can ruin him. But the new changes, I cant say. No one can, so you shouldnt be.Mcree - Yes, but relatively easier if he has no Flash.Pharah - Yes.Junkrat - ... Yeahhh kinda.. his spammy nature just denies him a lot of space he has to work with, and can defo be shredded.Torb - Hmm, dont really encounter much torb as DF, if turret isnt on your a**, and even if it is youre quite beefy to soak it up, and can still E combo him, since hes quite immobile.Zen - He should be yours for dinner. Znes mobility severely makes him a priority target for DF, and an easy one to. Hes not a counter to DF, if anything I'd say its the other way around.Sombra - Yes, but dont see her much to begin with. So, eh.","

"First of all, welcome everyone to Overwatch, personally i enjoyed the open Beta like a lot of people who played it (i even pre-ordered it long before that), but i'm sure also a lot of people felt the game would have greatly benefited from more modes, or even some sort of a story mode ... or both ... ENTER Story-driven Horde mode (i also have to admit that team-based arena shooters rarely ever have a story, but Overwatch characters are a different case since they beg to have their stories told, like Zenyatta)So the catch is that this supposed mode is both a Horde mode and a Story mode mixed together, like in Uncharted 2 MP co-op missions (check gameplay of that online to understand how it worked), basically you play sort of co-op missions with your friends aganist a horde of enemies moving from one set-piece to the next with some short cutscenes and character banter between each wave of A.I enemies and the next to connect the fights and give them a much needed context.I feel this is exactly what Overwatch needs right now, personally i rationalized the current MP modes as a sort of training simulation run by Athena for the old and new members of Overwatch to train themselves and develop new tactics after Winston called them back into action in ""Recall"" (that would make a lot of weird stuff sensible, like why shady people like Reaper and Widow can be on the same team as Tracer or Winston, or why can there be six Soldier 76 on the same team with consecutive numbering, even some of the bizarre character skins would make sense).Now this Horde mode would be THE actual story mode, it's still a multiplayer mode (which you can play with A.I bots as well) but between each enemy wave and the next you get tailored cut-scenes fleshing the background story of Overwatch and the character relations, something a lot of people feel Overwatch needs, something to connect the CG shorts and comics with the actual game, or part of it at least, each scenario could probably be played only by certain characters and of course no character duplicates, it could also double as an advanced tutorial to train on team tactics and advanced character combos by desigining some enemies that can only be taken down effectively through certain team skill/ult combos.The current Overwatch lore even provides the perfect conflict that can work as a horde mode, the first Omnic Crisis, this crisis is when Overwatch (the organization) was first made and they fought and defeated the rebel Omnics, most of the characters played a role in that crisis, even those who didn't can have another chance with the 2nd Omnic crisis going on in Russia (according to the Wiki), after all the mode could have multiple missions/senarios each from a different time period or location in the Overwatch lore.The main catch is that people won't be able to play duplicate heroes because it won't make much sense in a story focused MP mode, that's the main difference, also the enemies would be A.I militrized Omnic robots with varying sizes and types (including big Omnic badass Bosses, like the giant spider mech we see D.Va fighting in one of Overwatch trailers), the missions could be varied and switch between Escort to Control to Defense to Assault on the fly to keep the six players team on their toes, with a big climatic boss fight at the end of each senario/mission.Players could have limited number of respawns or they respawn as many times as they want from different check points throughout the mission but lose if the entire team is wiped out at the same time.So in short this new Horde mode does this:--Fits with the game identity as a Multiplayer-only team based shooter.-Adds much needed variety to the game modes available.-Not only does it provide an actual story mode and also character development (something a lot of people wish the game had) but it will also mesh perfectly with the story from the comics and amazing CG shorts, which is something the other MP modes can't do, it gives a much needed context to the awesome gameplay connecting it with the story elements from other media.Hope you guys like the idea and what it adds to the game, and if you do i hope you help me in promote it to Blizz so they might consider it in some way, cause not only i would love to see a mode like that in the game (cause it will make the characters shine even more) but i know for sure a lot of people would instantly buy the game if a story focused mode of any kind was added to the game.=========================An alternate take on this would be much limited in scope and only single player, a sort of story mode where you play a short level by each character to both train you on advanced techniques and tricks for each hero and also tell their back-story at the same time (and maybe unlock a special skin for that hero at the end of their level if you finish it on highest diffculty).I'd pay extra for that mode specially if it came with it's own short cinematics","

Lets bring in Genjis BS deflect hitbox, is THAT of all things fair?Im not saying support should be fodder for dps, but that is how it works dps should be beat support, its common sense unless the support gets help from the team, that is acceptable but the fact that a support can 1v1 a dps here is bsAlso have you ever heard of not shooting a deflecting Genji?","

The worst though is healing a D.Va that doesn’t defense matrix incoming damage that I can’t out heal to actually keep her alive. I used the command to tell people to come to me for healing often.

"I think problem mainly comes from so called dps mains usualy refusing to switch to something that teams needs right now where tank/support main players usually end up playing those roles because they are team players on first place.Maybe in higher ratings it is bit better but in lower ranks(where majority of players are) you have those Genji/Hanzo and co. mains that won't switch no matter what, would rather roll 5 dps 1 healer and lose than actually try to win. Then there are those Genji mains spamming ""heal me me me me"" all match and asking on forums to nerf supports.Ofc not everyone is like this but there are A LOT of such players.For my part, i fill with whatever team needs (although i prefer sol/reaper for dps) so obviously i end up playing support 99% of the time because nobody wants to play that role usually, not because i am support player.

"You guys know how when Zen discords an enemy, he can see who that player is, what character they are playing, and what their health is?Would it be a good idea to possibly add that same feature to Ana and her biotic grenade?The reason i'm thinking this is because when there is choke spam going on and I decide to throw my biotic grenade at the enemy team, I hear the hitmarker but I can't see who I actually hit. I think this addition would be benifical to target priority and help the Ana call out who can't heal so a flanker like Genji, Reaper, and Tracer can finish the job.I feel like the only problem here is screen clutter could be an issue.

"Two reasons.A) It might just work.  Probably not, but it might.B) This one is more likely.  If you are playing a mobile character like Tracer, Genji, or Sombra... you touch the point, try to get 2-3 enemies to turn around and come to the point, then when they get there you leave.  Then since you are more mobile than whoever came to stop you... you get back to the choke point before them and can (hopefully) roll whichever defenders stayed at the choke in a 6v4.","

						Aug 28, 2017

I do it all the time if I'm playing a flanker character like Tracer or Solve a. It works a lot. The enemy team will either split up to try and defend the point or you actually get the cap.

I've done a back cap before on volskya industries. I went Attack Symmetra for point B and once I got my teleporter I snuck behind into the break room and my entire team went through the teleporter and we flooded the enemy team from behind they didn't know what hit them. It was great.,"

"It's not necessarily a means of actually capping the point, it's more of a means of disrupting the enemy team, example: If the defense team is holding up tight on point one in eichenwalde, i go lucio and wall ride behind them and back-cap to split the team up so my team can take care of the choke.

"They've spoken of an up and coming hanzo change, I wanted to open this thread up for ideas and suggestions and maybe see what you guys think of what i would think would be a nice change to an ability, all feedback is welcome and i would also like to know what abilities you guys would change/add/remove.I've heard plenty of talk about giving him different arrows, that share a cool down with sonic arrow. For example instead of sonic you would throw maybe a healing arrow that explodes for burst healing like Ana's grenade but just healing. Or maybe a poison arrow that leaves a cloud of poison that ticks like widow's mine would, maybe even an explosive arrow but that's too straight forward and it would add too much burst to an already bursty hero, maybe a smoke arrow that blinded enemies in it but the people outside could still see their outline, like a zoning tool similar Mei's wall but without the physicality of actually leaving you trapped. One of the concepts i had for sonic was maybe change it so that the next arrow fired right after sonic would maybe pierce a wall of an environmental scenery for up to 10 yards of penetration, not like it would go thru a tower in Eichenwalde or something, just thru semi-thin walls and doors like that, to maybe give hanzo that niche of being able to his people thru wall every now  and then with both dragon or the super-sonic arrow that follows the sonic. This is a cool idea i have but it might prove to add another level of frustration to an already frustrating hero to play against, kinda the same as when i suggested that scatter would ignroe some of the little edges and stuff on the floor to give it a little more consistency but that might again prove too frustrating as the community feels they are getting scattered too much already.     Thoughts?Keep in mind i try and make my ideas as balanced and character oriented as possible but i'm not game developer, this might all be exceedingly op or straight up underwhelming. I would love to hear your ideas and receive feed back on my own. Cheers.","

Maybe select the enemy with a Zen-like highlight used for the orbs? Have it do 150 damage (no headshot).I wonder how Tracer mains feel about this...","

"Hanzo just needs sustain or an escape.You can remove scatter arrow as long as when 2 tanks dive him or he is up against his brother he doesn't instantly die.Seriously, Genji got the craziest kit in the game. I'd trade deflect or unpredictable double jump for sonic arrow or scatter arrow any day of the week.","
						Jan 22
					",,,,,,,
"Granted I don't have much time on Hanzo, I'd like to see: - Scatter and Sonic rolled into one abilityBasically think of the semi tracking arrows that are seen in the ""Dragons"" cinematic. You fire the arrow like a scatter arrow, but each split arrow does negligible damage (say, like, 5-10 per arrow), but they have a soft (and slow) track to targets and reveal targets that they damage for 6 seconds. - Sniper ArrowAs the name implies, this would be an arrow that, while not hitscan, would travel incredibly fast in a straight line. It would also penetrate through barriers (excluding DM) to help Hanzo be more aggressive. - Cyber AugmentsA new ability for Hanzo. Basically it would allow him to be a bit more agile.He has these funky legs that he only uses to scamper up a wall, so this ability would allow him to be more mobile.Once activated, Hanzo has 5 seconds of increased movement speed, much higher jumping, and sliding while running (by crouching while running).Drawing an arrow will break the ability and put it on cooldown.Cooldown is 10 seconds, but any leftover time is refunded (so if you just need to make one jump, the cooldown will be 6 seconds). - PassiveStays the same - Dragon StrikeActs the same, but travels slightly faster, and has a wind tunnel effect, where if you are caught in it (or slightly to the sides of it), your movement speed is reduced unless walking directly away from it.","
						Jan 22

"That's a very interesting dragonstrike buff.But I think his sustain is really the issue, will agree with that.","
							 (Edited)
",,,,,,,
"I agree with the Hanzo changes. It feels pretty frustrating to die to that scatter arrow and it feels quite wrong to get kill with it. It is just too easy to land the shot on the enemy's feet. I rarely play Hanzo but still the scatter instakill is easy to land. Hanzo is powerful in capable hands and outright op with scatter arrow. What about changing scatter to this biotic poison cloud arrow which deals damage to enemies and gives speedboost to friendlies, including himself. It  would give smokescreen with opportunity to retreat from charging enemy. Squishy flankers would also need to think twice to approach Hanzo.","
						Jan 22
					",,,,,,,
"How about switching the scatter to a Piercing arrow?Hear me out~If they switch out the scatter to a piercing, it may seem like an OP skill but what if you put limitations on it?You could make it so that only when the bow is fully charged, then it will pierce the walls or reduce the damage when it pierces a wall (since it went through a solid object) to maybe drop a 200hp hero down to maybe 20ish? but if it did not go through a wall, it should do the same damage as a normal charged shot.With this change, hanzo mains have to up their skills to at least fight against their counters like genji. It will remove his only way of saving himself from close range combat, but, he was not meant to play close range anyways.Hope this could help end the hanzo's rework thing~ ;)","
						Jan 22
					",,,,,,,
"Hey guys, I'm on par with the piercing arrow I think it would give him a chance to poke through the shields and take care of bastions or pick off supports. Still frustrating but he needs a way to actually kill people rather than having to flank behind 2 shields. Additionally I just want to see more mobility on him, give him a Mcree esque tumble to go with his piercing arrow, and let him climb up seperate walls without having to hit the ground. Making him at least have to jump to another wall to still climb, but sometimes you just feel stuck and immobile. Or make him a really slow character in the animated videos that !@#$ doesn't sell me.","
						Jan 22
					",,,,,,,
"I think they could give him an incendiary arrow that creates a small AOE burning circle (a bit like a smaller version of Mei's ""Blizzard"" without the frost). The Shot Arrow could look like a dragon-firework and be used for crowd control (enemy avoids the Fire) and defense against close-range flankers (shoot at your own feet force them outside the AOE fire's radius). I think this idea would fit Hanzo's character as a Dragon hero; maybe call it 'Dragon-Breath', or 'Incendiary Arrow'.","

"If there wasn't a range limit on such an ability, she could even synergize with Winston. I'd be down for it, since most well-rounded team comps have at least 1 shield tank. Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it being broken. Having barrier healing would make her more suited for the 2nd support, so a team running her this way already has a weakness with less healing.","

						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"If you do that then something has to give in the opposite direction. Take away one of her abilities...turrets, for her to fix barriers. You will also have to look at barriers and their up-time in relation to how much she can fix. Would it create a scenario when if you had a stack of barrier tanks (Rein, Orisa and Winston) with a Sym will they become unbreakable and too OP? If so, you have to taper something back (barrier health, how much Sym can fix at any given time, etc.) or increase the damage somewhere else to help break the barriers again. Its a neat idea but I just dont think Sym needs a another rework at this point in the game. Give the ability to repair barriers to another, brand new hero.","

						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"I don't think lack of healing is Sym's problem. There are a lot of examples in other games of character's who don't heal but are great supports. I think Symmetra's issue is that she has no active form of support to help out her team. All of her utility is of the ""place and forget"" variety, and with the exception of her ults, doesn't directly help her teammates live.She needs to have a more direct hand in the fate of her team. While healing barriers does that, I don't think that fits Sym's character or that it would make her more playable. She still wouldn't be chosen over an off healer in a lot of situations, because healing barriers only really helps tanks.","

							 (Edited)
",,,,,,,
"People complain about barrier watch being a thing, but they're also buffing Sombra and EMP reduces a lot of the efficacy of having shields and barrier heavy team comps. I realize that coordination is lacking in a lot of ranks, but it only takes one good EMP wombo combo to wipe a team out and make it nigh impossible for teams to set back up.Also, I somehow feel like barrier healing would probably still not be deemed as valuable as like actual healing unless it allowed Sym to replenish Zarya and Zen's shields as well as the shields from her generator.","
						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"I don't think it's a bad idea. People either complain about BarrierWatch, or moan that OW has too much healing. However, there's so much DPS in the game right now that even barriers don't last long. Winston's gets shredded like it's made of rice paper, as does Orisa's, and Rein isn't too far behind. Letting Symmetra repair barriers would mostly just remove a healer- making fights quicker and less wearing- and mean that certain shields aren't quite so pathetic.","

What if they gave her the ability to place a shield some place? Doesn't have to be a place she can reach either. She just has to look in that direction and then she can deploy it.

"First off, a huge thank-you to the team for revamping the forums; I'm super excited about what's been described already! However, I had some questions about guidelines as the new forums open up. I hate to be That Person, but a response to this would be wonderful as I'm sure a lot of people will be wondering the same thing.I know that it's already been stated that threads will not be transferred over to the new forums, as the formatting will be different. However, there are some big discussions happening currently, most specifically in the form of megathreads.As a result, once the new forums go up I'm sure a lot of people will want to copy/paste the content of threads, especially the megathreads, from these forums into the new ones so that discussions can continue. What are the guidelines going to be for that? Obviously spam and necro-bumping are still not good, but will copying the content of current, active threads for the sake of continued conversation also fall under these categories?Will these replica threads be allowed at all? Will they be allowed only for certain types of threads, for none at all, for only the most recent ones?Also, is there a way that moderators could ""translate"" and transfer current active megathreads over to the new forums, for the sake of continuity in feedback and discussion?Perhaps this has already been made clear and I missed it. Clarification on it, either from someone else more informed than me or from a moderator, would be much appreciated, though, as I'm sure a lot of people will have similar concerns!","

"When heroes first enter the world of Overwatch, they are instantly enamored with the inexorable cuteness of the Pachimari. They are drawn into the hypnotic stare and cloying squeak of the plush pretties. How I wish I knew then what I know now. Things would've been so much ... well, I better not dwell on my own issues now. My goal is to educate and disseminate vital information to save the very soul of the Overwatch universe, one hero at a time.HERE IS THE ISSUESeveral credible internet websites and several dark web blogs have addressed what has become known as the ""Pachimari Penumbra Predicament."" Google it, but only with a supportive friend around and while in private. You will understand why soon :(Pachimari are touted as half onion, half octopus plush toys that are an innocuous part of the Overwatch universe. FALSE.The TRUTH is that Pachimari are an ancient talisman of astrological significance that can be used to accurately predict the rise and fall of the Dark One, or the Deceiver by Many Names (जलेशु भूम्यं च जयमहे in Sanskrit).If 36 Pachimari are laid out in a 12' diameter, equidistant from each other and aligned to magnetic (not true!!!) north, there are several key days of the years that will yield shadow patterns that depict the character traits and strength of the latest incarnation of the Dark One and his key supporters.If a partial eclipse occurs and a 37th Pachimari is held up to block out all but the penumbra, the resultant shadow pattern can be converted into the ancient Babylonian unicode triangulation system of coordinates to locate the lair of the current Dark One, anywhere in the world.According to the NASA astrology department, a June 21, 2019, eclipse will coincide with the 4th turning, a key day of power for the Pachimari. Please, pray and prepare for what we find out on this upcoming day of dread.I will continue to research, study, and meditate on this dangerous topic and will keep active updates coming. TY and God Bless!!!","

"Look, I have a question for all of the Tracers, Sombras, and other flanking Dps out there. Especially Tracers . . . . When it comes to Mercy , Zen , Ana , Moira , Sym , and Lucio- Why on Earth would you not want a >Great< Symmetra on your team instead of a Ana/Mercy Etc?Tracer for instance. I study tracer players and how they play on youtube {The top 500 Tracers and etc} . . . and I notice a trend in the playstyle. Tracers almost never get healed by mercy, Ana, Moira, and Lucio.Think about it.Think of a battle field from left to right. Your team on the left and enemy team on the right. It goes . . . . Your Team Backline, Middle line, Frontline then Enemy Team Frontline, Middle line and Backline. That's 6 different lines from left to right. Where is your friendly Ana and Zen? They live in your team's backline. Mercy, Moira, and Lucio float from backline, to middle line, to Frontline. Now, where is your friendly tracer and sombra?Tracer is in the enemy team's backline. She's 5 lines ahead of your healers. It is because she is doing her job - creating havoc in the enemy team's backline. Even superb Ana's have a hard time landing shots on friendly tracers because tracer is 5 lines ahead of her. Even if she lines up a perfect aiming shot, most of the time, the shot ends up hitting something else that runs in the crossway of the shot {Due to there being so many players inbetween Ana and friendly Tracer.}Mercy and Moira can't sufficiently heal your tracer because that would require them floating into the enemy team's backline marking themselves vulnerable to death. The best healing candidate for a tracer is a zen - for the orb. Its not like you have to heal a 200 hp hero either. With that said, Tracer still leaves the vision of Zen most of the time due to taking damage and trying to avoid death. Now, I say all of this, because the shield Generator does wonders for Tracer.Tracers, if you have a great Symmetra {Not that many out there, but still}, why wouldn't you rather have that Symmetra than a Mercy? With shield gen up and running - - - You have 225 hp. 75 of that hp regenerates after 3 seconds - which means, you don't have to run for a health pack after taking trash damage. You have become twice as hard to kill. You don't have to worry about leaving the vision of zen and ana, because the generator can sustain you. I generally don't understand why tracer mains scoff at the idea of having a Sym on their team instead of a healer.Think about the game from every character's perspective as far as how they take damage.Widow is another example. But I'll leave it at that.","
						Feb 20
					",,,,,,,
"As much as I support each character having their impact on the team, I think it's a tad narrow-minded to assume that flanking DPS need Symmetra more than they need Ana or Zen, particularly Zen. Zen can at least supply a harmony orb for 3 seconds if they peek out, and Ana may hit them with shots from time to time.With Symmetra, the idea is what's best for the team. I get that many people don't like having a Sym-main. All the undeserved toxicity aside, the flankers benefit less from a Symmetra than the other healers. The only benefit Symmetra can apply to a flanker (assuming this is a standoff battle between the teams) is that Shield Generator, but only if the flanker is within range. As that flanker is likely far behind enemy lines, there's a good chance he/she is operating outside of the generator's boundaries, thereby not benefitting from it. With Ana and Zen, there's a decent chance they'll receive healing, however slim it may be. The Shield Generator forces the flanker to operate strictly within its limits, whereas Ana and Zen can have a decent LoS with a flanker.","

"Transfusion:- Ana now regains 20 health for every 75 healing she does. - Ana now regains 15 health for every 70 damage she does.Frankly, it's a little ridiculous that Ana is the only support without any kind of self regeneration. She should not have to use her grenade, which can be a huge game changer when placed correctly, to heal herself, as no other support requires a use of an ability to do so. Biotic Grenade should be a tactical ability, not a reflexive one.The amount she heals herself maxes out at 20 for healing and 15 for damage respectively. The numbers decrease the less damage or healing she does. For example, if Ana shoots an enemy with only about 40 health left and kills them, she would only self heal for about 10.This new passive would:A) Promote healing allies over doing damage to enemies to regain health.B) Increase Ana's ability to survive, especially at a time when dive is prominent.C) Encourage better aim.","

"02/20/2018 05:40 AMPosted by Alhaitham02/20/2018 05:08 AMPosted by MrGarrisonHow can you allow this to happen over and over again Blizzard?  You have players that are trying their best to get out of the lowest rank in the game. Then some person comes along that for the last x number of season was PLat or higher, and some how, (we all know how) they become so bad at the game that they are now in bronze.  And then what happens?  They team up with their bronze player friend and destroy the other team. You have to be able to see this happening, with all the stats, and all the things you can go back and review, this is an easy catch.  Hell, I can spot them easy just by looking at the previous seasons stats.This is awful for players at lower ranks, and not doing anything just tells us that you don't care. You're in mid gold though ,how would you know this happened in a bronze game ? Suddenly climbed two tiers ?I have different accounts.  And I only just placed in gold in this account.","

"So, blizzard has recently made an update that higher level ranks must be within a pretty tight SR rating for matching purposes.  They also made SR gains/losses of higher ranks to pure win/loss, removing skill based gains. They are completely ignoring the other 50% of the game when it comes to changes. It's like we don't exist.  A Plat player should never be queue in a bronze game, that's stupid if it happens, and clearly points to laziness of the people in charge of making the competitive experience fair and balanced. Also, if it was such a violation to derank yourself to either poo on lower level, or to boost your buddies, why does it happen so often?  I was in a game not long ago with a genji on the other team that for the first 5 season they were GM. In season 6 they went from Masters to bronze with 92 Hours played.  They literally ruined our game. We could not compete. His ult was up every second, and the kill feed look like Genji, Genji, Genji, Genji, Genji, Genji.   It was easy to spot what happened for everyone but Blizzard.","

We all fight Moira’s and even those of us who decide to play her often will be too late to pick her since others play her, too. I don’t always want to be Moira either. I play against them and I do fine. I have no issue with her in the opposing team even if we don’t have one. Tank meta isn’t balanced? Was dive? Is any meta balanced? Meta means it is better than everything else as a general rule and it isn’t due to any single hero. That’s like blaming Lucio and Zenyatta for the original dive meta. Which existed until the Mercy rework and they just replaced Lucio with Mercy in most cases. Sorry, but the balance you want has never been done in any game ever unless everyone has the exact same options and randomness is removed from play.","

Oh wait, they probably do.I play both Moira and her counters (tanks). If someone actually bothers playing her beyond the bandwagon hype, he'll know what can't and can f her up. It's just sad that people cry about her now when she's been the same since release.","

"Ok so this isn't my first account and i have been playing overwatch on and off from day one. One thing i have seen is the genji is rarely nerfed and even when he is its in areas that are stupid to nerf. For example in this account i am focusing on my mcree game,previously i was an ana/winston/widow/torb player and noticed that every single hero has advantages and disadvantages. For example when mccree had very little damage drop off ,everyone went CRAZY and demanded they nerf his long rage bullets and now he is more of a medium range hero with crappy skills(no i won't get into his skills.i have accepted nobody is ever going to rework mccree.its going to be 2030 with 100 overwatch heroes and mccree will be the dinosaur with the same kit as day one) But Genji is a hero that can snipe a widow with ease since he has no damage drop off,he can fight mid ranger with his jumping and he is LETHAL in close quarters because he starts jumping around you that unless you kill him in the first 2 seconds you will lose him from your sight and he will use his right click to end you.  And then he is given deflect which is an ultimate level ability, i mean this ability can deflect ultimate abilities and essentially makes you invincible. then he has an ability that recharges with every kill.hanzos wall climbing and a double jump. and not to speak of his actual ultimate that seems to have a longer range than widows sniper rifle and essentially takes out everyone in seconds. I get that Genji has become the most popular character ,especially for the teenage kids under 18 who love him and will defend him to death, but isn't it ridiculous that there are heroes like mercy who just got nerfed to death.mccree who has been nerfed since day one to just having a good gun and nothing else. Symmetra who doesn't even matter in high level play. most heroes have been turned down from 8/10 9/10 to 6/10 to balance the game out for future heroes because as the overwatch team explained its easier to have a hero that at first doesn't break the game and is a bit underwhelming that they can buff instead of having a game breaking hero which makes everything worse for weeks. so why is genji still with the 10/10 abilities. let thy hate commence","

People who defend gengu forget he has no true hard counters as his kit allows him to deal with any situation (not necessarily killing) assuming the gengu is good enough. He has soft counters which act as a nuisance more than anything (said soft counters are mostly troll picks).Tracer is the same except she literally has no counters once you are good enough.1.  Nerf deflect hitbox and give it an accurate animation and allow melee through it. 2.  Dash only resets if you have done 50% damage to the target when she/he/it dies and only within LOS.3.  Dash has a larger (vertically) hitbox than Doomfists old punch.  Make it smaller. 4.  Double jumping does not hide your critbox.

"You forget that widow outsnipes genji because she also has no damage fall off also genji has tons of weakness, just play McCree, Moira, or Winston (pretty easy to pick up heroes and they're meta right now). Also genji hasnt been nerfed a lot because when he does get nerfed it is big nerfs (you'd know that if you did your research), he got a nerf removing triple jump and 8 sec dragonblade to 6 sec dragonblade. Also McCree isn't bad, look at Pine's gameplay of McCree.

"Is it hard for the devs to do something useful and fix Genji for example? Like his deflect but also the wall climb, dash, shurikens and sword (basically his whole kit). I get that people think that Genji is easy but he isn't. He is even harder due to his bugs, which include teleporting back after already dashing behind someone, shurikens hitting people but not doing dmg, wall climb just stops which makes sure he can fall off the map, the last sword frame in the last second is visible but ignores doing dmg, and his deflect hitbox.

This is on top of her seemingly wearing a full suit of armor, yet having zero in game armor and the exact same health as every other dps in the game barring tracer, reaper, and bastion for a variety of reasons, in addition to having a frustratingly predictable/oddly moving shiftjump that isn't a 1-frame move and seemingly extremely subjective to server/client delay problems, as more often than not in killscreens you'll see the opponent not even registering you've moved.Why are there so many issues baked into the same character at the cost of direct rocket damage/ultimate speed gain?On the bright side, knocking people off does give a very large chunk of ult gain, due to the health=charge mechanic from environmental kills... But does this really make up for the fact that her hitbox is also the size of a house, as a wingtip-hit of her jets does full damage of a body shot...?This is ignoring specific hero interactions like the fact that genji can seemingly deflect rockets that have already hit the ground on your screen if he's remotely close to it while deflecting. I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way but the time invested learning the speed of projectile in order to hit flick shots and the like feels far less rewarding than if you'd spent your time attempting to master any hitscan hero, genji, or someone like widow.Should we expect to see any changes to her in the future? Or is she just forever supposed to be the Worf of overwatch, something that every other hero needs to be able to beat to prove they're strong enough to be a threat?Not all of these changes obviously need to be implemented, but I would imagine a fair number of people would love to see even one of them, something.","

If you see a bastion, don't fly arround like he wasn't there :)These characters are meant to limit your air-space.If the enemy sees you as pharah and doesn't try to do it, then it's their doomfall.If you have limited air-space but insistently fly arround like if you were free, then it's your own fault.PD: Try hard landing every now an then, propelling youself towards soldiers. At short distance and in ground, these characters will have a harder time pinning you down (doesn't work with mcree tho, don't get in his zone)","

"It’s one of the reasons I really enjoyed this game, in addition to being told in October ‘16 it had a Halloween event. Games doing those have a good chance at getting me. When I picked this up on Black Friday that year, I’d read up on McCree’s and Reinhardt’s comics. Before even playing I looked at the heroes. Thought I’d end up playing Reaper a good amount more, but McCree really sold the game for me. I can’t enjoy westerns enough, and seeing a hero like that that I can relate to so much was great. I relate to McCree more than Reinhardt, but love both. We don’t know what McCree threw off the train. We don’t know what Torbjörn and Bastion are doing. Doomfist said they have a war to start. We don’t know the how and when that (I believe anyway) Blackwatch (not Overwatch) found Genji. Zarya discovering Sombra’s real name seems out of place and I still question it. We’re near two years in age and Recall still hasn’t really given us anything on whereabouts of much of anyone or who’s actually coming back. There’s just so much missing right now, that I don’t know if they plan to try making this last or not, but I honestly never see a thorough story taking place to explain or wrap up much of anything. This really makes me sad. At this time, a McCree animated video hopefully including Sombra in some way is all I can about hope for. Even if the story never gets told, having that much would be at least a little offsetting to the sad reality knowing you’ll never have a full, fleshed out complete story.","

"02/20/2018 05:54 AMPosted by PlayerActually Mercy can heal herself pretty easily. Ana, on the other hand, can't.This is exactly what I guess what other healers think when they don't heal their Mercy. ""Mercy has fast self-regen, she doesn't need healing"". While most of the time this is true, when a teamfight happens at a choke and a Dva is spamming her leftclick, the self heal just does not activate. Who's Ana... :D Joking. I didn't forget Ana, but she can use her nade to heal herself, right? I know it does not heal her up fully and has a cooldown (and may not be the best play), but it is something you can activate yourself. Lucio can amp up his healing, and Moira can throw an orb, but Mercy and Zen cannot -actively- heal themselves.","

"02/20/2018 06:32 AMPosted by BexI didn't know this was a problem. I always heal my zen or ana if they're hurt.In QP the need for two healers is a bit more iffy at lower skill levels (Especially when #2 is an Ana and you don't have any tanks). As a result, some healers may prioritize other players above the other healer due to tactical reasons or just because they want the other healer to get off of it.","

"I agree that they should try and expand their arcade options a bit more, however you have to take in to fact the number of people that are playing arcade at any time. The more modes that exist, the smaller the number of people per mode there are, thus increasing the time it takes to find a match.","

"Team DM has proven to be one of the most popular modes of Arcade due to user demand but it gets shafted each time. Team DM is so fun, it's fast and it's a good warm up for tanks and support players. We can't warm up in DM as its just dpsing the whole game.","

I didn't expect an answer but at least a couple people got to see my post.  Didn't No man's sky buyers get a refund?  I mean they told me one thing which led to my 4 friends buying the game.  I'm still happy with the game but they are not since they feel betrayed.,"

"TDM is most fun on arcade and the best warmup - while FFA is random pain in the !@# ... most of the time it's luck or frustration. Maybe it's about lootboxes (I know how these businessmen think!): People play a fun game mode they enjoy, win more often, get more lootboxes - buy less of them. If it's just about THAT, remove the damn lootboxes and make the TDM a regular mode. I want a game to be a game, not a place of business administration strategies. Yes, I could play on the servers, but we all know, they are not real servers and completely rely on the one random player who hosts the server, so there is no stability in gameplay. Since you don't allow real dedicated servers (because you want to sell lootboxes), give us at least a working matchmaking with all arcade modes.","

What I would like to see for Reaper.Wraith form- Cooldown increased by 3 seconds. - Cooldown starts the moment you press the button.-Wraith form can now be cancelled by pressing the same button. But needs to be used for atleast 1 second instead of the full 3 seconds.- Wraith form now reloads 2 rounds the moment it's used. The other 6 rounds will reload over time.Use 1 second of Wraith Form and gain 2 rounds Use 2 seconds of wraith Form and gain another 3 rounds (5 rounds total)Use 3 seconds of Wraith Form and gain yet another 3 rounds (8 rounds total)- X% faster (maybe. I'm not sure about this one)Shadow step (Can't give any numbers. That's for the Dev team to decide)- X% Faster (Again. Maybe. Not sure about this one)- X% Damage reduction while using Shadow step- Reapers Shadow Step now has a sensitivity bar in the options menu.Edit;Wow guys... 100 likes and counting. That's something I didn't think possible when I posted this...I'd like to thank all of you for your like and especially all of you who keep this thread alive by taking your time to leave a comment :)Let's make a change guys!!,"

"When you say clips I’m assuming you mean rounds/bullets? I’d love for wraith form to be capable of being canceled out of. So many burst characters can just time a burst to kill you the moment you leave- when you’re probably already hurting in the first place. Though if I had my wet dream, wraith form would be a toggle ability similar to Defense Matrix. Allowing reaper to blink in and out of corporeality on the battle field. Obviously it would need tweaks- if argue to start minimum time in wraith form would be 1 second, max up time 2 seconds.  This would allow you to use it reactively to engage in and around fights, not almost purely as an escape tool, but a way to dynamically position around a fight.As for shadow step- well. Now hear me out on this one. I’ve posted this before- it might be fitting here. Imagine if shadow step was reworked:1) when teleporting to a location, a thin whisk trail would dash to the location, as we see on reapers cinematics2) when you arrived at the location, you would remain there INVISIBLE. But with a small bit of smoke lingering around the floor, your view shifting to third person for better situational awareness. 3) you would remain invisible, until you attempted to move, or pressed the button for the ability again. 4) taking  damahe whole invisible would also knock you out This would allow reaper to be, in my opinion, a rather interesting AMBUSH hero. Something we don’t have- at least not to this degree. Now you could flank at range, and wait to surprise people when they least expect it. But the whisp trail means you couldn’t easily use it mid combat to EASILY get behind people and ambush them- reigning it in more for preemptive ambush set ups. And having the whisp on the ground while you wait allows keen players to spot you and deal with you- similar to a junk rat trap.I feel these changes would go a long way to making reaper feel more interesting and more importantly more dynamic in team fights-While also heavily fitting him thematically, based on what we’ve seen of him in his cinematics. I’d love to play him as we saw him- whisping in and out and around and about.","

"Cancelling wraith would be awesome. Reaper needs an ability that aids him in a fight. Most of the other heroes have abilities like that.  His kit is just way too simple. It would be great if blizz finds a way to raise his skillceiling, without making him a pain to play against in lower ranks (like pharah)Above 3000 he just gets more and more difficult to play because his abilities are too simple and his range is effectivly like 7m (or less when you are fighting a small hero).Just one of those negative points is ok to have (f.e. Tracer has short range but a good kit, Mccree has longer range but his abilities (mostly roll) are not the best) but both bad is a bit too harsh.","

"I'd like it if it was on a resource meter. Minimum time of 1 second in Wraith Form and only starts to regenerate after 2 seconds after leaving Wraith Form (these two prevent spamming the ability). If that's not enough, there could also be a minimum amount of time you have to wait before re-entering Wraith Form, let's say 2 seconds. Like you said, you wouldn't instantly reload all your ammo, but instead gain a bullet for each second/X time interval in Wraith Form, with being in Wraith Form the max duration giving you all your ammo. Speed buff should be increased for sure, maybe slightly faster than Soldier's Sprint. Also, jump height increased by 150% when in Wraith, allowing you to get to higher ground easier during the duration. Also, the animation could be changed to have the smoke effect, similar to the cinematics.Shadow Step could maybe teleport a bit faster, perhaps 20%. Also, maybe the look from his highlight intro would be better, as you can't line up a headshot as easily.Numbers are just placeholders.","

"From healthpacks for Sombra? Not keep it exactly the same, obviously. More like nerf it by about half? After all:Every character that heals get ult charge. Even Roadhog.These buffs are things that should have been in the game since the beginning. Why should we have to lose a major part of her kit just to compensate for things we should have had all along?What reason would there be to keep healthpacks hacked other than to heal yourself. Yeah, they keep flankers from healing, but most of the time they rush back to their team to heal anyways. Now, the only thing healing from Sombra's hacked healthpacks will do is take away ult charge from ally healers.Basically, they should keep ult charge from healing, but nerf it by half. That way, she's not completely reliant on healing from them anymore, but she still gets rewarded for doing so.","

"I know this has come up before but doesn't seem to gain traction or Blizzard response.  I'd like to create a main thread hub of discussion for this topic.Recently playing in small groups of 2-3, it's become apparent that a group finder is very very needed.  I know a lot of people want a ""Role Queue"" but I think there are a lot of inherent issues with that.A group/role finder outside of matches, however, seems like a good way to prepare yourself and set an expectation prior to a match, as well as promote group queuing and teamwork.  For example, my brother and I queue often, I can play any tank, he can flex as a support or DPS.  We'd love to be able to to post looking for a static projectile DPS player, another tank, and a dedicated support player before we queue.  This will allow us to potentially find some long term friends as well as ensure we won't have any issues with toxicity and role selection.The benefits speak for itself, I think this is something Blizzard should seriously look into.  Can we open this up to discussion?  Anyone know of any pros I'm missing?  How about cons?My idea for how this would look is a simple option on the main screen menu, and we could get an in-game browser of sorts, similar to the custom game screen.  People can post their groups and edit their requirements as needed, it can show how full the group is, and you can create your own post as well.  Open up text chat and voice chat during the group formation process so people can hash out what they are looking for.Let me know your thoughts.Thanks!","

It also doesnt help when the ping on the PTR is hella inconsistent. Sometimes I get a cool 34, which is what my ping usually is, and then it jumps to over 100. You cant play worth a damn with anything over 100. I am not worried about her being overtuned. Most people will jump on the bandwagon and hope they can start to be awesome Sombra mains and most will drop off due to her still being a hard hero to play (A LOT of managing timers, probably more than any other hero..5 separate cool-downs which could be happening all at once). If you could not do well with her before, a few tweaks to hack time and spread, is not going to automatically make a Sombra God now.","

"Well, it's interesting but I think Zarya is pretty well balanced already.Problem with extending the duration is the way Zarya's barrier work - when they are broken, any 'excess' damage is not carried over to Zarya.i.e. a well-timed bubble will save you from a D'va mech explosion even though the explosion causes much more damage in a single hit than your barrier can absorb.  The barrier immediately disappears but you are left unscathed.If you have any 'degradation' mechanic, you essentially extend the window of her 'one-powerful-hit' invulnerability even further which could be OP.Also, what would you do with the cool-down?  Would it start its reset count-down before or after the degradation period?  There's problems with each then...  Before = too much uptime on 'one-powerful-hit' invulnerability, After = too much time with underpowered bubbles lingering about.","

The PotG algorithm seems to weight things more heavily then the flame algorithm. Things like environmental kills and ult shutdowns matter way more for PotG them on fire.Environmental Kills, Ult Shutdowns, Lifesaving, and Sharpshooting boost chances of getting PotG. Ult Shutdowns and Lifesaving seem to provide LESS of a boost than Sharpshooting and Environmental kills though.Now that doesn't mean a Lucio can just boop two players off and get PotG. A Pharah could beat him for getting a quintuple kill with her ult for example.Just know that if a Widow gets 4+ headshot kills in a row or a Lucio boops 4+ people off the map well... You're probably NOT getting PotG... lolThen again I was in a custom match and got PotG as Torb using the teabag spray and dancing, so who knows.","

"One time I lost the POTG to the Hanzo on my team. This was before the recent butchering- I mean nerf, to Mercy. The point was close to the second checkpoint, I was on defence. I revived two allies, got out Mercy's little pistol, and killed 3 enemies (Widowmaker, McCree and got lucky with a Tracer who just ran right in front of me) while I was flying before going back to healing the only injured teammate which was our Reinhardt. The Hanzo got two kills, one headshot and one bodyshot. That was it.TL;DR. POTG system be broken.","

"OP, if you truly believe that matchmaking is rigged, just play on your 3k smurf.  Or buy a new account.  Or quit the game.  Honestly, nobody else really cares.Personally, I don't think matchmaking is an issue.  I climbed from bronze (~33 rank) season 1 to a high of 4.2k last season.  I have never once played a DPS character in competitive.  Is it because matchmaking ""favors me?""  Maybe.  But I know that I was stuck in platinum for ages until I got a new graphics card (improving my performance), and then I suddenly jumped up to masters.  I doubt that the game hated me for 5 seasons and then decided to boost me just because I upgraded my computer.","

"I primarily see Widowmakers do this, a lot and quite frankly I think it's just gross, It's an extra level of cheese that this game doesn't need. I know there's no way to combat it, but I believe that this ""technique"" shouldn't be encouraged.I just join a custom server for the first time ever, and joined a Widowmaker Headshot only server, big mistake.The players there are more salty and concerned about your rank than the people in QP or Comp.Crouch spam was given a soft cooldown and I firmly believe that ADAD spam should also have a soft cooldown.I spoke to a few people about it in the General Chat on the Menu, one dude explained how he's got a macro set up so that when he left clicks as Widow, he immediately crouches. That clearly goes against the ""one button one action"" rule.I understand the whole point of crouch shotting is to ""juke"" your opponent. But the kind of players I see do it are the ones that follow up their kill with a side of salt, almost bashing you for not being able to kill them, I don't get it, You took the cheesy way and killed me because I wasn't expecting you to crouch, that's not boasting your skills, that's just being a *@@*%!%*. It's almost as bad as that Genji who told me ""But I'm Genji..."" once when I killed him as McCree.I don't like drop shotting, crouch shotting, whatever you wanna call it, I understand that it's a strategy of sorts (that should've been left in CoD) but what follows is usually just as bad, I don't think I want to see this kind of behaviour reinforced, but then again, 80% of this game is usually a salt mine and it seems players will do whatever it takes to either ruin your experience, or boast about their ""epic skills"" or ""talent"" that is, essentially, pressing the crouch key as soon as they shoot, followed up by a spray on your corpse and complimentary tea bag.","

					",,,,,,,
"So I posted this in another forum but I just wanted to get a general idea of how you all would feel about a different skill instead of Shadow Step.  I honestly rarely use it other than to get outside of spawn and maybe MAYBE once in awhile get to a 2nd level.  The animation puts us at to much risk to use any other time really. When I think of Reaper, I always think of Death and his awesome Scythe.  Here's what I think would be a cool replacement for Shadow Step:Scythe (melee)Cooldown: 6 secondsSkill Description: Reaper swings his scythe in a wide 180 degree arc capable of hitting multiple enemies. If only one enemy is hit damage is increased by 10% and the target is pulled closer to Reaper. Life steal is also applied to each strike.Now the reason for the damage increase is, Reaper is a 1v1 character general tank buster. The idea behind the pull in is because our shotguns suck at range we all know that, but when they are close we melt which everyone also knows so they stay away from us. Well now we have the ability to pull enemies in and make sure our shotties are hitting the target with the full spread instead of just half or less of the bullets fired.  Since we already benefit from Life Steal per shot why not apply the same effect to the Scythe attack.I know its an additional melee but more often than not we are right in the face of someone anyways to get all of our shots to even count for damage.  Think of the pull in similar to Road's Hook, except not as much range it's intended use is to pull the target in so that 1 shot from our shotguns all the bullets hit instead of just half or 1/4.Just tossing the idea out there thought it'd be cool to see or even use but what do you guys think?","

"You do, but I get FAC3 and what he is saying.  It is intended to be used to flank hide in a corner then teleport to an opposite corner without being seen.  The issue is that it takes so long and you have no control over whose in that opposite location so you can be picked off very easily.The Scythe skill I think would be a great addition to Reapers toolkit.  Puts the Death back in the Reaper name and honestly makes us a bit more formidable in 1v1 since we now have 2 forms of attack plus our standard melee hit.","

I have played many times with a friend in gold. me (3126) him (2312). 07/09/2017 11:07 AMPosted by GitgutSo, i just played a game, the matchmaking system believed that pairing me with a level 25 gold player against a 3 stacks with 2 diamonds was balanced. Obviously we got rekt. This is not the first time that happens, everytime I Q with a friend i will find diamonds in the other team while my team would shoot himself if they could. This one sided matches are super frustrating and i feel that they are stealing my SR. This is PS4 by the way, i dont know if this happens on PC too.And i can definitely agree that the matchmaking sometimes rly strange or complete !@#$. But i have to say that blizz cant make the matchmaking 100% fair, i do think that matchmaking is more complex than we can expect","

"We've all had those games where there's a pharmercy that is the bane of your existence as Ana, or a Dva that needs a nade ASAP in the air but gets demeched before she reaches the ground.I propose that Ana should be able to remote detonate her grenade in the air by pressing the same button again. (I don't play PC)I don't mean to upset anyone but Paladins has champ named Pip who has an ability similar to Ana's grenade, but he can detonate his heal potion in the air so that he is able to heal his teammates in the air, and his teammates on the ground more accurately.I believe this QoL to Ana will give Ana more control over her biotic grenade especially when lobbing it over barriers and such, and create an effective counterplay to pharmercy and Valkyrie.

It based on player availability unfortunately. So first it tries to find players near your SR level and keeps increasing until it does.

I used Visual Studios 2010 and created windows project which I added a webbrowser object to and just went page by page through the forums and read each thread title and reply count. 2. How I determined a thread is about a hero is using key words. For example Mercy may have ""Mercy"", ""Rez"" and ""Pharmercy"" to determine a thread is about her. 3. To determine if a thread is about balance I chose this keyword list:public bool OPCheck(string title)        {            title = title.ToUpper();            if (Contains(title, "" OP""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""BALANCE""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""NERF""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""BUFF""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""CONCERNS""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""BROKEN""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""FIX""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""CHANGE""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""POWERED""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""PROBLEM""))                return true;            if (Contains(title, ""REVERT""))                return true;            return false;        }4. I did very little bug checking so any unique errors it came across I didn't handle. I had 32 exceptions at the end of my forum crawl.5. At the time of running the software page 9991 was the end of the forums.","

Plus, Ana is not part of the launch hero, Mercy is.Also couple the fact that while Ana was overpowered, she wasn't exactly much of mustpick. at least not in all ranks. i clearly remember playing mercy a whole lot during triple tank meta, while the rework made mercy a must pick in nearly every single rank. so there were more outburst against mercy. plus couple the fact that mercy mains we're largely ""divided"" cause they wanted different things (some liked the rework, some didn't like it, people wanted to nerf her, people were against the nerfs, they wanted to change certain aspects, they wanted a revert, etc. etc.) all because, again, of the rework. i'm assuming this wasn't the case in triple meta, as discussions about it would simply be about adjusting ana's current build, unlike mercy's which talked heavily about prework and rework and the grays in between","
