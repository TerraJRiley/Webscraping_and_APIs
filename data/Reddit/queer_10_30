"A question about gay men who pose as women on tinder to attract ""Straight"" men","It's a thing in Online dating, where occasionally I'd match with a ""woman"" and it turns out that in fact this woman is a ""man"" seeking   a samesex relationship with another man.

I get it that there are *sad* repressed people masquerading as heterosexuals who in fact are repressed queers and some people find those repressed people attractive. I'm just not that sort of repressed person. 

When I get one of those matches and the truth comes out I politely explain I'm not interested and perhaps the person seeking a same sex relationship will have better luck next time.

What are the breadcrumbs that people put on their profiles that make people think a person would want a same sex relationship and what cues should I use to indicate that I'm not interested.

FWIW if I wanted to explore a same sex relationship - I'd fire up grindr ",queer

I'm an IB student and I'm doing my Extended Essay on the subject of queer art, titled 'In What Ways Does Queer Art Affect Societal Opinion and Understanding?'

Are there any queer artists (digital or physical art) on here who would be happy to send me a portfolio and answer some questions about the topic? I already have two trans women on board so a bit more diversity would be appreciated (trans men, nonbinary people, gay people, bi people, etc.)

"I [33] recently realised I've never felt as a male, but I don't feel like a female either. Any directions?","On the one hand, I was thinking this is truly privileged from me, as in this is one of the ideals to aim for, to not feel constrained into feeling like a male or a female.

Yet I have been, of course, unconsciously bound by typically male aesthetics and thinking all my life. It's just that now I'm kind of challenging the whole idea for the first time ever, after struggling a lot to find solutions for my image and feelings, and finding little or none.

Not that I haven't struggled with the whole area of life that has to do with sexuality and gender ‚ÄîI do, a lot‚Äî, but it's that I never thought of it this way until now: I asked myself, did I ever feel ""male""? And I struggle to find occasions where I did.

I was wondering if there's any name for this (genderless?) and if there were any suggestions on where could I read current theory on this matter.

For clarity: It's not either that I feel like I have some male things and some other female ones, and fond of both as such as in non-binary, but more that I feel like none of what I have is bound to the male or the female world. For an example, I have a penis, and I like it, but it's not as if that's important to me or my identity, I wouldn't care if I had a vagina instead. Or about character traits, I don't feel fond or dislike any of those for me because they are more male or female, but just fond or not fond of them.",queer

One of our leads is a trans guy (trigger warning: in first episode other characters misgender him, we intend that to change going forward if we get picked up to series, hoping to explore what it would mean to come out while under witness protection). 

The story follows him and his family as they adapt to life in a small town in witness protection.

Queerology and The Truth of Fitting No Where‚ÄîA Ramble,"I‚Äôve been finding it very interesting to maneuver myself in queerology, if you will. I identify myself as queer, genderqueer, and in most cases I feel heavily connected to a two spirited identity.the way that the media has portrayed queer, is not my cup of tea as well. 

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been struggling with trying to figure out my placement in the world. And honestly, I come closer and closer to the conclusion that I don‚Äôt truly have a specific place. I am here to learn and ‚Äúgrow‚Äù as a root for those to gander around me. I could easily force what I think onto others, but it is not my place to force them to learn anything, or to adapt to a different mindset. All I can do is encourage it. 

Not really sure why I‚Äôm deciding to post here‚Äîexcept no one knows who I am. But there are many people that I think can relate to me on some level. The traditions and the things that my parents have taught me, truly have traumatize me‚Äîand I have let it consume my everything; how I approach my speech, my job, my relationships, my walk in life, on and on and on and on.

But I‚Äôve come to a very large understanding of what it is that I need to be doing in order to debunk these ole thoughts and ways. And that is just DOING it. Doing the truth. Speaking the truth. Being the truth of myself. 

I can not do anything better than that. 
Not to mention, sex is a huuuuuuggeeee part of that.

"A ""fashion meets mental health"" kind of post. [Very long, kind of rant.] [Advice request.]","Hi, and please excuse this first time poster.

This is also rather long (as you've surely seen), so only take time to read if you're willing to spend some. I've been pondering a lot where to post about this as I wrote and thought about it, and I've found no more fitting place ‚ÄîAny reccomendations to crosspost this would be more than welcome! 

I'm also a mess, and so the post will probably be a mess.

---

So, as the title goes, this is mostly a ""fashion meets mental health"" kind of thing. I'm having trouble with my identity and looks, and with finding something to do regarding that that makes me feel good.

I'm a heterosexual man, in his early 30s. Cis looking, but I don't identify with masculinity very much, or just nothing ‚Äîmaybe because I'm very much of a loser.

Always had trouble with the whole identity and aspect areas ‚Äîthink not entering a hairdresser between 15 and 25, or not ever buying any clothes unless extremely necessary, and always failing at it; all of this out of social phobia and other troubles, not as much as gender aesthetics‚Äî, so I'm kind of feeling like a teenager here. 

Anyway, lately I'm just breaking apart in all sorts of ways, and while I think I understand queer theory perfectly (*In One Person* by John Irving is a book of reference to me), I still don't see myself as queer ‚Äînot for now, at least. As I said, the cis part is sort of what's at.

Let me get to the point:

One of the things I do in my solitude to not go crazy is take walks in my little village (50k people or so, but very lively), looking at stores windows and such, and lately I felt more anguished than ever by the amount of options women have, and the few men do.

Now, let me elaborate a little on what I exactly mean by that, because I know it can sound like a very generic thing (""this guy wants to cross-dress"" sort of idea), but I think that's not the case, and this is the first time I've found myself so distressed about this. It's also definitely not sexist ‚Äînot blaming anyone here!

The issue I find myself in right now is that I feel like I need to buy or acquire things for my body identity looks that make me feel good. And the problem is: I can't find anything that makes me feel that way.

Masculinity aesthetics don't work with me because those are associated with success, and are simple. I tried them, and it makes me feel like a fraud. Similarly, I don't identify with any kind of urban culture or aesthetics, where the culture takes over the gender binary, so that doesn't work for me either. (note: I *do* believe that many people that feel like I do, find a place in those other spaces, hence my problem.) 

And I see what there is for women, which are just endless possibilities, and I'm envious of that. Alas, I don't want to look like a woman either, nor I am feminine looking ‚Äîalbeit I've been told I have some mannerisms that are more feminine than masculine, like delicacy with my hands, or in the whole aspect of moving my body, I am still a 1.80 man with a broad face and beard.

To put in other words: I'm thinking of the stereotype of women that goes shopping to cope with something, and I've never felt as if that's something I can do, and yet that's what I kind of need now ‚Äîas I feel that the only thing I have left of worth is my body, which I see as kind of tragic, but that's how it is.

Money is also an issue and part of that envy, becuase women's complements are cheap and they can mean a world to them, but there's not such thing for people like me. A woman can buy a dress for 20‚Ç¨ and she has an entire new outfit, and then gets to complement this with a series of objects. There is that, for men that want to feel manly, but that won't work me.

So, isn't with me wanting to be and/or look like a woman, or me wanting to be and/or look like a men, but as stated before, I am in a very delicate place mentally, and I find that, as a man, I have no options to feel better in that area. 

And, I understand and respect queer people that like radical things for their looks, but that's not me either. I am discrete, I don't like to stand out, or to be told I look attractive or pretty. But I don't want to look like I can't even dress properly either, at my age. And I don't want to look 'asexuated' either, as I'm a very sexual person in fact. Androgynous aesthetics are also for cool people, and I'm not cool.

The only few things I considered, that would make me feel well, are painting my nails and doing very simple earrings. But again, not to stand out: I don't want to stand out, I just want to take better care of myself, primarily for me, to feel like I am worth something, and if I can be successful and this helps people judging me the better, that'd be great too. So these would mean simple color nails, and simple round earrings. Can't do much with hair ‚Äîit'm keeping it for now, but better not to play with fire‚Äî but I have a beard.

And yet I still miss being able to have more options for dressing, that don't make me look so out of place. I am not from an urban environment, and while people wouldn't judge me over here (think close of Barcelona, Spain is a very LGTB friendly country), doing weird things would mean standing out, and I don't want to stand out.

I just want to feel good about my aspect as a person. If I had some cornerstone, I guess that'd be great and would work for me, but right now I have virtually nothing.",queer

New to the LGBTQ community‚Äîhow do you date?!,"Hi everyone! As my question says, I‚Äôm very new to the LGTBQ community. After a bad breakup with the girl who made me realize I was gay, I‚Äôve only recently started trying to get back out there via online dating, and I‚Äôm having some trouble! When I only dated men, I had no problem attracting guys,
 (mainly because I look conventionally feminine, not because I‚Äôm super hot). But that standard seems to be different for queer women? One of my gay friends jokes that I look and act like a straight girl who leads worship at church (probably true, since that was my identity for most of my life). But is that a turn off to queer women? Is it possible to look *too* straight? Am I giving off a homophobic vibe? Or are queer beauty standards just different (i.e. higher)? 

 I haven‚Äôt had any luck online dating, and as I‚Äôm from a conservative community, I don‚Äôt know anything about how to connect with other LGBTQ people. Can anyone give me some pointers?

Meaning of Queer,"What does queer mean to you? What does being queer mean to you, as well?

Im struggling to grasp the concept, in some way. I understand queer in general, translating from peculiar, can encompass the entire LGBTQIA community. However, can queer be a sexual orientation? Is it a placeholder for question?

I myself am ""questioning"" I suppose. I'm a girl, and I've known all my life that I've been attracted to girls. I'm only just now coming out to myself. I've never been able to get off from a guy, never really lusted after men like I do after women, but there was *one* man who I would have given up everything for. And he wrecked the notion that I may be gay. I don't think I'm bisexual, cause again, I'm not really attracted to men overall, especially not like I am to women, it's just this one guy was different. And so that's why I've been using queer as my orientation.

I understand at the end of the day a label isn't the end all, and that it's just a matter of I like what I like, you know? But, at the same time, I sometimes struggle with how to internalize all this change into my identity without being sure of what I am.

TL;DR - what does queer mean to you? Can it be a sexual orientation?",queer

I'm looking for a good book for a bisexual refugee in english. She needs something to conquer all the internalised homophobia and to empower her to accept herself.

"My bf is trans, I'm a lesbian (?), we have a problem","I don't know what I am anymore. Gay? Bi? Straight? Halp pls...
And my bf, a trans-man, is so insecure and assailed by doubts. This is partially my fault, I guess...


My boyfriend was born a girl.
I've met him ten years ago (he was 15, I was 18) on an anime/manga-convention in Germany. He didn't look like a typical girl, more like a tomboy, but I was used to this look; a lot of my gay friends used to dress like boys and had short hair but... he was different. He told me that he was trans on the day we've met ... because I grabbed his boobs tbh - anime-style! He didn't like that, obviously xD. (sounds weird out of context, maybe even with context, idk)

He told me ""I just don't wanna be reminded I have those milk bags hanging from my chest, ya know... I may be born a girl but actually I'm a boy.""

That made him the very first trans-person I've ever met. We became friends. After a few years of friendship he confessed to me that he was in love with me.

This.... ruined... everything... I couldn't deal with that. He was the best, the cutest, the kindest person ever, I loved him so much but I just couldn't 'LOVE' him back!

He is a boy - I am a lesbian. I never saw him as a girl and therefor gf-material. I just didn't **want** to fall in love with trans-guy, tbh. I had my coming-out when I was 14. I, a femme myself, have only dated femmes, cute skinny girly girls (~~f'cking pillow princesses~~) and he knew that. He knew that from the start.

Our close friendship slowly fell apart. I dated two other girls throughout the years. This must have been horrible for him but... We stayed in contact, mostly because he needed help and support because his family abandoned him (even his beloved grandparants after he was outed), he suffered from anxiety and PTSD and I was (literally the only one) there for him. Even covered for him financially, payed his bills whenever it was possible. And, of course, we both still loved the same stuff; Anime, Manga, Cosplay, RPGs, all that weabo-shit.

We, again, grew closer. I left my toxic gf and moved to his town to take care of him. This is when I realized... Apart from my very first girlfriend, I've never loved someone so much like I love him. I would do anything and everything for him. I even found myself attracted to him (this started even before my realization, tbh).


We've now been together for almost a year. He lives with me at my place because his appartment is a depressing, messy shithole. We have a lot of problems but the one problem that really hurts to admit is...

He felt the need to change for me and now he isn't certain about *what he is* anymore and neither am I.
He's 25 now and admitted to me that he isn't sure if he really wants to change his body (take hormones and shit). I mean, he still wants to get rid of his boobs (we call them moobs, like, man-boobs) and he wants to grow a beard and so on but at the same time he's terribly affraid of the progress and that I wouldn't be attracted to him anymore... And he likes to be the cute, submissive part sometimes... and I enjoy that too. We're both switcher, so I personally don't see any problem with that, even after his transition.

At first he tried to talk himself out of the whole trans-thing because he was in love with a lesbian (me). Didn't work, tho. Of course not. If it was that easy, most of the trans-people would have just ‚Äûtalked themselves out of it‚Äú.

We talked soooo often about it. I told him that there were several guys in love with me when I was a teenager but no-one would have ever changed his gender just to date me, nor would I have wanted that.
I love him for who he is; my small, chubby, cute, socially awkward BOYfriend.


And here is what confuses me... I don't find men attractive at all. I had intercourse with some because I was a stupid child who desperately wanted to be straight, even after my coming-out, but I never... loved a man or wanted to be with one and after a few years I finally embraced my gayness. XD

In my eyes, my bf is a man. I'm actually looking forward to him getting a deeper voice, a beard and a flat chest and it confuses me when he's in teamspeak or discord, talking all girly and sweetly because of the ‚Äûbonus‚Äú girls apparently get in the gaming community, I dunno. I don't like it but ok.

What does that make me...? I mean, I was finally happy being a lesbian and now I find myself questioning my sexuality again... *I still don't find any man other than my bf attractive.* =/ In fact, he's the only PERSON I want. I don't even desire other girls anymore, despite all the problems we have... What does that mean...? Am I suddenly straight now or what? oO I'm bad at this whole queer terminology.


And how should we deal with my bf's insecurities? I already told him that it's okay if he changes his mind and that I understand that he's scared of all the changes, I just wanna support him... A lot of trans-people go through a phase of fear and doubt, right...? The three trans-people we know (all our age) are already at least half way through their transition and never showed any sign of doubt. I can see that it makes him sad that they're so much closer to their goal and everytime I compliment our best friend's beard, he looks so bummed out.

I'm trying to talk him into a therapy atm but he's afraid the therapist tells him to take FEMALE hormones (cause he apparently has a lot of testosterone...? Is it true that gender dysphoria can root in something like that?) or that he has to stay for in-patient treatment because of his anxiety, phobias and diagnosed but untreated PTSD. (I think that would be the best for him but I can't force him...)

Is the media giving the impression that sexual orientation affects ability?,"News articles all over continually focus on the fact that a person is not hetero-sexual when they achieve something. Does this mean that anyone who chooses a different sexual orientation is not as capable? I would argue that sexual orientation has nothing to do with anything other than the personal relationship between two people. Their ability to do a particular job, or achieve something great has nothing to do with their sexual orientation. Granted there are some jobs which may benefit from their orientation as they are open minded about it, but does that mean we have to harp about it every time a non hetero-sexual person does something notable? Is the media giving the impression that sexual orientation is a disadvantage?

For full disclosure, I am a straight white male. I have no issues with anyone due to their sexual orientation, color, religion, or nationality. I take people as individuals who are living their life in a way that makes them happy. I have friends who are gay or lesbian. I have worked with a huge variety of people from different backgrounds, and I have never considered any of them less valuable than the next person. The lifestyle choices an individual makes honestly has absolutely no effect on how I choose to live my life. By the same mentality, how I live my life should have no effect on how someone else chooses to live theirs. 

Consider for a moment that you are walking down the street, and you pass 20 different people. Can you tell which ones are a different race? Yes, obviously because it is very visual. Can you tell which religion each of them observes? In some cases yes, if their apparel is specific to a religion, but for the most part no. Can you tell what their sexual orientation is? Unless they are very flamboyant about it, then no, you cannot. Is there a reason for them to hold up a big sign saying which orientation they are? Sexual orientation is typically a very private matter, and many people do not feel they have to make it known which they are in public. I would argue that the vast majority of lesbian or gay individuals only tell people if it is relevant. For example if a guy is hitting on a lesbian, she might inform him to prevent an awkward situation. The same woman may not introduce herself to the new person at work as a lesbian. Most people who are not hetero-sexual do not feel the need for the entire world to know. They will let people know that are close to them or who they interact with regularly.

We have a tendency to point out that people are different, but the more we point it out, the more separate they will feel. If we just accept who they are as an entire person, and not focus on one aspect of their chosen life, maybe we'll start to see things shift more. As soon as we form opinions about someone based on color, religion, or sexual orientation, we are being bigots. Things are slowly moving in the right direction with open marriage options being accepted in more and more places with all of the same rights. I just think we don't need to continually point it out at every opportunity because sexual orientation is only a fraction of who a person is, and does not affect their abilities. 

Let me be clear as well that I believe every person deserves to live their life in whatever way they choose as long as they are not harming another person by doing so. They have the right to any job they are capable of doing, live where they want, and not be judged because of their orientation.

I've been in the closet for 15 years, and while I do have a slight preference for women, I'm attracted to basically everyone (just like I'm not a dom). My current social circle is mostly made up of queer people and they've made me feel very safe to be who I am lately. But to be like this in public?   
Around people who looked down on me for years assuming I'm ""the typical maledom who got into it because 50 shades""? Including one who apparently wants to kick my ass for ""ruining his reputation"" when really it was just that the girls he molested started talking?   
Also, I definitely don't ""look the part"". I look basically, huh, manly. And I attend with my main girlfriend. And I'm extra frightened by rejection because I also have BPD (yay).

Queer v Bisexual v Pansexual,"Hello, all -

I'm a writer (and, well, just a person!) trying to understand the differences between these words and what they mean to someone in the LGBT community.

Here's what I've got (corrections invited!): 
Queer = an overarching term for anyone who wants to use it that is in any way related to the LGBT community (i.e., not heteronormative).

Bisexual and Pansexual = ACTUALLY mean the same thing.  But people misinterpret bisexual to mean that someone is only attracted to cisgendered people (""bi"").  So some people prefer Pansexual because its more inclusive of (or at least doesn't hint at an exclusion of) an interest in genderfluid/transsexual individuals as well.

How'd I do?  Help. =)  And thank you.",queer

Recommendations for what to say/avoid saying in letters to LQBTQ+ homeless youth?,"So, as you may know, 40% of homeless people under the age of 25 identify as LGBTQ. Often times, these kids are neglected/abused by families and run away, or they are outright forced from their homes. 

I live in Los Angeles and I want to organize a fundraiser to support the LA LGBTQ Youth Center. I have the money part covered; what I need help with is how to give these people some emotional support as well. I love the idea of giving the center some handwritten cards or bracelets or bookmarks or something to let them know they aren't alone; something they can keep to look at when they feel down. 

I want to avoid saying anything that might come across as condescending or rude or anything negative. But I also want to avoid impersonal messages like ""you can get through this."" 

Do y'all have any suggestions for what you might want to hear (or NOT hear)  from a fellow queer who is more privileged than you are, but wants to use that privilege to help? ",queer

I sometimes act like a guy when I'm with my friends who are girls. but I'm more attracted to men and women who are more masculine. I have an urge sometimes to cut my hair and just become a guy.

Scottish trans people need your help! | Government Consultation on Equal Recognition (Open to ALL),"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like ‚ÄúI support trans rights‚Äù already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

Responses from outside of Scotland/UK are also welcome - a lot of the negative responses come from transphobes around the world.",queer
Try Not to Cry,,queer
Is this 'romantic love' or 'intimate male friendship' or whatever else?,"UPDATE: Our friendship/relationship has progressed wonderfully since he returned from his home-town. He spends nearly half of his time staying with us at the house, as he promised, while the rest of the time he lives on the University campus to access the library - which also means he spends time with his 'girlfriend'; and i have since discovered this is a casual relationship from his brother/my flatmate. When i express expectations of him spending more time with us at the house, he earnestly explains that he wishes he could spend all his time with us at the house and is constantly thinking of coming over, however, he has to apportion some time apart for his University work. He feels accountable to me for his whereabouts; he will call/msg me to inform that he is leaving town for few days to visit family and our goodbyes always end with the promise of meeting soon. He will play uncontroversially  romantic songs and 'dedicate' them to me for how they address the object of the singer's affection. My flatmate wasn't home a few days around my birthday, and interestingly, this is the first time he chose to spend time alone with me. He came to the house 2 days prior to my birthday, and during one such dinner, he said to me that he loves living with us, believes the place to be 'home' and seriously expressed a wish that the 3 of us continued living together in future. As we sat next to eachother during dinner, he then said to me that this is the happiest he has ever been in his life, and claimed he believes he will never be this happy again in life; and then claimed the same on my behalf as well - that he's sure i too will never be as happy again as i am this day. I smiled and nodded in agreement to him. A tangible development to happen over the months is that now it is commonly understood that him and i sleep next to eachother in the common hall. As we lay next to eachother, we usually talk for sometime before eventually falling asleep. I have consistently noticed that he demonstrates a child-like excitement in being there in the moment with me, he will shift noticeably closer to me in bed and will constantly touch me lingeringly, as if to get my attention. He has even invited me to stay with him at the University over a weekend - just the two of us. All of us went to watch 'Shape of Water', and one night when we were the controversy associated with the film - the representation of people living with disabilities and implication for identity politics versus individual experience, he said to me, ""I have reached a stage in my life where i believe anything is possible...a woman may fall in love with a humanoid sea-creature or a humanoid sea-creature may fall in love with a woman...or a man may fall in love with a tree or a tree may fall in love with a man...i believe what brings two people together/closer is a mystery, and i would rather choose to go along with it than question it...""...He has constantly demonstrated affection and closeness to me exclusively, to the point that his brother/flatmate is positively amused that his otherwise misanthropic brother has found a companion in me...He still believes that i not only am i the best version of myself as a person i can ever be, but one of the best persons he knows...

tl;dr: 38 yr old 'straight' friend and i (30M, gay) share a very cherished and affectionate friendship. He believes and publicly acknowledges that my 'presence' healed him of a debilitating health condition (typhoid) - instead of crediting his younger brother and girlfriend (new and casual relationship) who constantly did all the physical labour during this period for him (while i performed what may only be characterized as 'emotional labour' for him). What does it really mean for a ‚Äòstraight‚Äô man to appreciate and acknowledge that a ‚Äògay‚Äô man has a certain effect on him emotionally and/or physically? He has vaguely expressed a desire for being physically intimate on atleast 2 occasions, and likes sleeping close to me. This story is replete with clich√©s from romantic legends: I ‚Äòrecognized‚Äô him at first sight; I feel like he‚Äôs telling me that ‚Äòmy love healed him‚Äô; he claims he gets poetic for me; his body language responds very powerfully to mine. Should i wait for him to realize he may be bisexual and perhaps feels romantically for me - or is this behaviour or intensity of friendship typical/usual for 'straight' men to share with their gay friends?

I (30M) started renting a home in New Delhi with a friend in July 2017. For nearly 2 months, i noticed a young man in a crowd of friends who used to visit my flatmate occasionally, maybe once in 2 weeks, but i barely ever made contact or socialized with him. I didn't even find him noticeably attractive enough to even be curious about him. One fortuitous day in September, i joined the circle of friends at home and started a conversation with him. I found out he (38/39 yrs) is my flatmate's elder cousin brother who lives in the city and studies cinema. I was supposed to be in bed early as i had an early morning the next day, but i ended up staying up till 6 in the morning talking and listening to him, about cinema and his life. We got along really well for a first time meeting. I stayed up all night despite better sense because i kept saying to myself ""I like listening to him, i want to stay a little longer. He sounds like a kind, warm and passionate person"".

Following week, he visited home again. We had a brief conversation, after which he decided to leave bcoz he wasn't feeling well. I remember feeling intense grief and longing for him, which is when it first struck me that perhaps how i felt about him the first time i met him, maybe more than mere appreciation as a person/friend.

He started visiting home more often now, and i started feeling it was because of me, that he liked spending time with me - instead of his brother/my flatmate. My feeling was corroborate soon bcoz my flatmate had no idea of his brother's whereabouts, but i always knew his whereabouts or whether he's coming home, because he started texting/calling me. I remember asking him 'how he's doing?' those initial few times we met, and he responded with some melancholy on at least 2 occasions, telling me that he's going through a 'low period' in life, work-wise and that there is no woman in his life. Once i knew he is 'straight', i attempted everytime to restrain my heart.

Then, we had 4 glorious days over Diwali, where he spent the long weekend with us at home. After the first day when we had many friends over for a party, we spent the next 3 nights staying up very late, just the 2 of us, talking about our lives. He wanted to know everything about me - right from my childhood, to my growing up years, family, relationships, work, appreciation in music, literature and films - and he listened with immense joy and interest. It wasn't until we were halfway into one of his conversations about his life experiences with family, holding onto a steady job and relationships, that i realized he is trusting me with a lot of information and is a little vulnerable, as he spoke of his 'shortcomings' very unabashedly to me. I felt so honoured and privileged to participate in his life so meaningfully this way, i wanted to hug him for opening up to me so uninhibitedly. He also started reading me very well. He knew exactly what kind of humour offended me, and pre-empted my thoughts even before i had finished forming them. He reached out and placed a hand on my shoulder if he sensed he had offended me and apologized. It freaked me out that he could read me so well, without me even expressing anything. He reached out to me if he saw me lingering in the balcony late at nights, asking after me if i was alright or needed to talk to him. When we stayed up all night talking there were long pauses, where we just sat in each other's company and strolled on the balcony, in silence - and for the first time in my life i did not find silences to be stifling in the company of someone. In fact, i basked in it and yearned for the night to never end. It felt like our minds, bodies and souls are practicing a form of unspoken communication, and we understood each other perfectly. Understanding that i was capable of developing such a sentient relationship with another human being also put me in awe of him and our relationship. My love and respect for him as a person only grew exponentially.

So it's during these 3 days that i believe he first 'blurred the lines'. We were having a conversation about dating/relationships. I told him that as a gay man i've tried meeting people either socially or through the dating apps, but i've always been disappointed bcoz i am not what most people are looking for, and vice-versa. I told him that i have an image in my head where my life turns out like a Nora Ephron movie, where the love of my life will just walk into my life one day, or that i prefer meeting people 'organically'. He responded to my thoughts by saying that he has also had similar experiences as a 'heterosexual' man, and prefers meeting people 'organically' like i do. He then said, ""Just look at the 2 of us. Earlier we didn't know eachother, and didn't speak, but somehow we came together and now we like talking to each other so much"". I thought it was very strange for him to comment on and mix-up our friendship in the backdrop of a conversation exclusively on 'dating/relationships', so i instantly paused him and pointed it out. He considered it for a moment, and replied, ""i feel similarly towards any relationship - friendship or romantic"". I accepted it, but i still felt it was a strange mix-up, and potentially 'misleading'. Interestingly, the very next day when we were having dinner together and continuing our conversation from last night, he once again remarked with a little joy/excitement, ""I agree with everything you're saying. I remember the first time i saw you. You entered the house, put your things in your room, had dinner, spoke to my brother and went to bed. And this is how i saw you for sometime. You didn't say 'hello' to me or acknowledge me. But just see us now, we like spending time together and talk so much"". i was like ""AAARRRGGHHH! Why does he keep doing this?""

Within a week of this beautiful, long weekend, he fell inexplicably and violently ill with typhoid. At first he moved back to his home in the city. His brother and i visited him the following weekend, where he remarked the moment he saw me that he was very happy to see me and later thanked me profusely for visiting him as it made him feel much better than he did in the last few days. After a week, he called me and asked if he could move in with us, so that we could care for him. (Ofcourse, he called me and not his dear brother ! :) ) I welcomed him to our home and told him to stay as long as he wants. While his brother prepared his meals, i would make tea/coffee/soup or breakfast for him, and he was such a darling for it. Even during these days, we had some beautiful moments; like the time i shared anecdotes of arguments or conflict with friends and colleagues, to either vent or seek their opinion - and he always demonstrated the highest faith in me as a person, and never doubted that i could be wrong or capable of hurting a friend. He said i'm a 'good hearted, caring, ethical, nice person'. I was overwhelmed by his unwavering faith in me (more surprisingly, as it was founded on a thin foundation of very recent friendship).

My most intense moments with him arrived in the midst of a very complicated time. After a week, his health worsened, and this is when his 'girlfriend' moved in with us. I was hurt, because for the longest time he led me to believe there is no woman in his life, even as a 'heterosexual' man. Once when i jokingly asked him to visit an attractive female friend who is a physician to check up on his health, he replied very self-assuredly and cockily, ""i do not want to meet any women. I want to explore my male friendships. I am very happy these days"" - which obviously led me to believe that he is perhaps feeling something for me. I was miserable and dying on the inside seeing him in constant pain and misery, and it hurt me more that i couldn't go near him as his 'girlfriend' was there for him. Also, did i mention his 'girlfriend' was more like his child-bride - she must be in her early 20s. Her Florence Nightingale act was really chapping my ass. Now, I will bullet-point the most magical moments, in interest of brevity:

The day after his childbride-girlfriend moved in with us and took-charge of taking care of him, i maintained a safe distance from him bcoz i felt totally fenced out by the childbride-girlfriend. That evening when i returned home from work, i made small talk with him, asked after him, and walked to go to my room. He called me back and said, ""Can you please sit with me for sometime and talk to me? I'm not feeling well, and i believe i'll feel better if you're here and talking to me"". I ofcourse obliged, bcoz was in pain and i wanted to help my friend. At this point i am still under the impression that he just needed anybody's company to humour/comfort him - but as was to learn in the days to come, he meant to seek out for me specifically. After we had a brief chat about my day, work and i shared some jokes, i observed he noticeably looked physically better. He was sitting up straight now, instead of lying in bed. Then he said to me, ""Has anyone ever told you that you have a very nice presence?"". I literally spat out 'What?' - not bcoz i didn't hear him, but bcoz it was such a strangely beautiful thing to say to a person, i couldn't believe anyone could speak this way. He repeated himself bcoz he thought i didn't hear him. His childbride-girlfriend was in the room when this happened. I wanted to hug him and never let him go, for being so vulnerable and beautiful to me.

The very next day was Pride Day in New Delhi. I had already decided to cancel to be home for him. When i woke up by noon (it was Sunday), and walked into the drawing room, he brought up the Pride with me, and explicitly said to me, ""Don't go, stay home"". I obviously told him, ""I'm not going anywhere"". He then shared a funny anecdote for about 10 mins, after which i remarked to everyone in the room that maybe the medicines are finally working, bcoz for the first time since his health worsened he appeared to be physically capable of carrying on a conversation by himself. They all laughed, and his childbride-girlfriend sincerely said, ""He's feeling better because you're here now. He wasn't talking to anyone all morning"" - and his brother jokingly affirmed it. He only smiled and looked away.

One can only imagine how this makes me feel. He's tacitly acknowledging that my 'presence' has a 'healing' effect on him (if you're thinking at this point that i'm too full of myself, wait for it...). I felt special, appreciated and loved like never before.

One day when i was leaving for work in the morning, he was still in bed when he asked me what time i'll be back home by evening. I asked him if he needed something. He said, in the presence of his brother and childbride-girlfriend, ""My health worsens by evening, as the medicines begin to wear-off. I feel terrible and everything becomes unbearable. I'll be better if you're around. I just need you to come home early"". I just couldn't believe he needed me this way, persistently, despite his brother and childbride-girlfriend constantly being at his disposal. I was nearly in tears bcoz i have never witnessed a man who is so vulnerable and reached out to someone so tenderly. I stroked his arm and told him i'll be back soon. After this day, he regularly asked me in mornings if i'll be back home soon. When i came home in evenings and asked him how he was doing, he'd say, ""I'm OK, but i'm feeling much better now that you're here"". I felt like i have someone special in my life and loving to come home to.

Despite all his affection, it was a little overwhelming to come to terms with the fact that he has a woman in his life. So for 2-3 days, i remained quiet and aloof from him, as it killed me to be around them as a couple. One day some common friends visited home to see him. He was talking to a friend and was speaking in pain and exhaustion, narrating a story about how the doctors inserted a drip in his arm, and sadly observed it as the 'highlight' of his day. I felt terrible looking at him feeling like shit, so i tried to lighten his mood by reminding him that our lovely friends had come home to see him. He entirely ignored that and said very matter of factly to everyone, ""Usually, the highlight of my day is when [insert my name] comes home in the evening from work and tells me about his day, his stories and makes jokes. But he hasn't been talking to me much in the last 2-3 days"". I died when i heard him say this, bcoz i never want him to believe that i resent him or hold a grudge against him for anything - even for not telling me that he already had a woman in his life - because I have had the most surreal and beautiful time of my life with him. And it pained me more that he felt this way esp. when he was suffering in such pain. I told myself that i had to learn to deal with the fact that he has a woman in his life, if not for my sake, but for him, bcoz this way i can be there for him again, and i couldn't let him suffer in pain knowing that being with me made him feel emotionally and physically better. I swallowed my problem in one day, and he observed happily how i had 'come back' to him.

After a little more than a month, when he was healthy again, we had a little party at the house and invited close friends. One of the friends couldn't stop gushing to him about how good he looked now and that it was so good to see him like this again. Everyone was in the room, and he said to her, ""It's all because of [insert my name]. Everything happened because of him"". I wanted to hug this tender, beautiful man and never let him go. As much as i fell deeper and deeper in love with him, i was scared his childbride-girlfriend would stab me for 'alienating his affection' :/

[Once he was healed (by love?), the childbride-girlfriend moved out of our home]

He was discussing cinema with me one day, and spoke of some really good queer cinema he had seen. He spoke of the Chinese film 'Lan Yu' - the story revolved around a slightly older closeted man who is in an on and off relationship with a younger man, is in denial for long, even marries a woman and get's divorced and eventually comes back to the young man - and said, ""it's such a beautiful film. It affected me so much. I didn't know i could feel this way."" I froze and didn't ask follow-up questions, bcoz i am still not sure at this time whether he feels 'romantically' or 'platonically' about me. On a separate occasion, when we were having a conversation about gender/sexuality - as i'm a lawyer who works on SOGI issues in India - he admitted that it is his sincere belief that everyone falls on a spectrum of gender and sexuality, and there are no fixed identities.

One Sunday when i was working in my room in evening, he asked if was very busy. I said i'll be working briefly, bcoz it's urgent work. He smiled and said, ""I understand...[hesistatingly] It's just that Sunday is the one day i get to be with you for a whole day...""

One night just before sleeping, we talked about faith/God/divinity. He initiated the conversation, asking me what i thought of it. After i gave him my opinion briefly, I asked him for his and he started by saying he believes God/divinity/energy of the Universe flows through everything (i jokingly referred to him as Pocahontas), and for him personally, it manifests most commonly in the form of natural objects (trees) or people / relationships. Then he said, ""I believe i cannot live with you. If something happens to me, you are affected by it. If something happens to you, i am affected by it"", gesturing at me.

He is well-read in literature and poetry, and he often quotes poetry to/for me, whether privately or publicly. And it is always an expression of fondness or appreciation, particularly expressed for me. One day i told him that it's quite admirable that he gets poetic so often in the backdrop of our conversations / situations. He was amused, as if i was telling him a falsehood about himself, and refused to believe it. I reminded him of the times, and he embarrassedly / shyly noted, ""Maybe i get this way when i am with you...I am a very different person than what my friends know me for, when i am here...I am a happier person...I think it's because of you..."".

By mid-December, he decided to take time off from University and go live with his parents in his hometown for a few months. He asked me, nay, rather told me that he wants me to accompany him to the rlwy stn when he leaves, bcoz he needs ""help with the luggage"". I think wondrously how it worked out so perfectly that of all the people - his brother, his University friends, and childbride-girlfriend - this crazy, beautiful man wanted me to go with him to the stn. on his final day in the city.

Few days before he left, when we all decided to sleep in the hall together, communally. While he and i slept on either sides of the room, the middle space was left out for our 2 friends who were still working in their rooms. We were having a conversation, making small talk and jokes. There was a lull in the conversation. The next thing he said was, ""We are sleeping on extreme sides of the room"" and sighed. The first thought that entered my mind was, ""Me thinks thou dost protest too much!"". On a simple reading of the situation, that line by a straight man to a gay man did not read like a harmless comment to me in any Universe. I asked him, ""What about it?"", and he only repeated himself in response. I registered that comment as a protest/complaint, and took the first chance i got to sleep next to him. At one point in the night, i felt his hand on my back, intently. I felt so much love in his touch.

The day came for me to drop him off at the rlwy stn. We were more or less quiet throughout the cab ride, except making small talk. After i helped him settle down in the train, i asked him if he was excited to be home. He walked away from me w/o answering the question. When he said goodbye, he had the look that said ""i don't even know why i'm leaving/what am i doing?"", hugged me tenderly and left.

We have been constantly in touch over the phone; in fact he often speaks to me just before he goes to bed. He said the thing he misses most about being home with us is some of times we spent together.

I either feel like we are lovers presumptive, where nothing needs to be said and we should let things take it's natural progression - Or - i am dealing with a very intimate, heterosexual male friend.

My sincere belief from the point where he first blurred the lines of the nature of our friendship/relationship: i believe for sure there is a lot of fondness, affection and love as friends here. But just based on how he expresses himself about how he feels towards me and is sometime confused on where to place our friendship / relationship, leads me to believe he may be in a process of discovering he is bisexual. And if he is indeed undergoing a process of discovery, i do not want to interrupt it by rushing 'the talk', ask questions, seek answers and ruin everything. I want him to have the time to understand himself better while he's away. I do sincerely hope he loves me back completely as i love him, spiritually/romantically. All those precious moments we shared, he made me feel like magic.

Well, that's the best i can do to explain his behaviour or emotions. What do y'all think?",queer
Gay poem I wrote about starting to date again after coming out,"I think you‚Äôre really cute

And you have blue hair

And sometimes its green

Or black

And you laughed 

At a stupid video I showed you

And we both like Vonnegut

And Steven Universe

And Kimya Dawson


I want to kiss you

But I‚Äôm afraid

Cause if you don‚Äôt want to kiss me

Its gonna be weird

I like being weird with you

But I don‚Äôt know if you like being weird with me

In the same way


I wish I had met you in the summer

When my brain chemicals were 

Balanced

And I felt capable and fun


You make me want to be better because I want you to like me

And I‚Äôm not who I am

Right now 


And so I‚Äôll try

For myself so I can share

Myself

With you

You make me want to be more

on queer peer pressure,"so i am an afab non binary person. more so that my concept of my gender doesn't bother me that much.. i identify as queer and recently got into a heated argument with a member of my family who told me i was taking up space by calling myself queer because i'm not actively having queer experiences or relationships.. that in itself is complex. I have had relationships wherein i hadn't been aware boundaries were being crossed or that the other person wasn't on the same page, miscommunication. 
I'm currently in a headspace where i want to grow into myself and be slow about it. but i have family members (who're trans and queer) who tell me i am doing it wrong. it makes me doubt myself, what if i am not behaving queer enough? am i queer enough? am i actually taking up someone else's space and taking away a platform for someone else to speak on???
 i have dated cis men before, a femme partner briefly, who have had queer relationships and experiences (they're queer if they want to date me, so i make a point to have those discussions). i am polyamorous, the idea of dating multiple people doesn't bother me. I have had some very deep connections and it's always with the soul of the person, not their body, like i can't not see deeper than the surface and there are so many complexities to people. who knows what you can teach one another! who knows what you can learn just by making friends or finding lovers in all shapes and forms and genders. 

I guess i just wanted to get this thought process out of my mind (i have never posted something like this before), and maybe there are other people out there too who have people around them who make them feel isolated, like your identity isn't good enough. When, at the end of the day, my mind and body and soul are going to be there when i sleep or when i wake, when i go for a walk or have a cup of coffee. someone else's projections of what you should be are harmful if you seriously let them get to you..

Research into the experience of sex and sexuality in women who have OCD,"My name is Elicia Boulton and I am a student at UWE undertaking my Professional Doctorate in Counselling Psychology. As part of this course I am undertaking research into the experience of sex in women who have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The aim of the current project is to listen to women‚Äôs voices and understand their experiences of sexuality and sexual practices when they have been diagnosed with and/or undergone therapy for OCD. This research is supervised by Victoria Clarke (Victoria.Clarke@uwe.ac.uk).

This research is open to women aged 18 or older who have a formal diagnosis of OCD and/or have received treatment for this condition (including women who have recovered and are willing to write about their past experiences). The research is open to all women so please feel free to share the details of the research widely. I hope to hear from women with a wide range of sexual experiences and identities (including women who identify their sexuality as heterosexual/straight, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and trans and cisgender women).

Participating in the study involves completing an online open-ended survey - you'll be asked to provide some basic information about yourself (nothing that will identify you), and then answer a series of open questions about your experiences of sexuality and OCD; you respond in your own words (this is not a click box style survey). The survey will take around 20-30 minutes to complete depending on how detailed your answers are.

Please use the following link to access the survey if it is something you are interested in or would like to share, and many thanks in advance for taking the time to read this: -https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7Ptf1L1YvxWhivj

possibly trans,"EDIT: This post is very long, but it IS in chronologically order, so it shouldn't be terribly painful to read. But it might be. Sorry!

I've been questioning my gender identity since around 8th grade. It was all vague back then; I didn't really know how I felt, but I've learned more about myself. I am 19 now.

Here's the story.

I was born female.

Growing up, my favorite toys were stuffed animals - dragons, or horses, or pokemon, it didn't matter much. However, I distinctly remember asking for the boy's toy at McDonald's 99% of the time because I thought they were cooler.

But I didn't play or hang out with boys. I hated sports, so what they did on the playground looked boring. I liked to make up imaginary worlds. In fact, I LOVED it, and would spend hours with my best friends crafting towns and shops on in the playroom using stuffed animals, blocks and other toys.

I didn't like skirts very much, and had no sense of style at all. I made my mom pick out all my clothes because I didn't care what I wore. I had hair on my arms and people were mean to me about it, and I was embarrassed.

I don't remember ever wanting to ""be"" a boy as a kid. I liked some boyish things but nobody seemed to care or mind. I didn't really think about it, I was just me. 

Middle school was...a blur, but more of a time where I figured out my sexuality than my gender. Things got interesting at the end of eighth grade where I started talking to Jackie, now Jack, about gender. She felt like she was a boy inside, but I wasn't sure about myself. 

Around this time, though, I finally found clothes I liked! Freakin' button downs, jeans, and blazers. That's what I wore and I looked damn hot in them. Y'know... for a 14 year old. I also started to become really obsessed with androgyny, and I even saved pictures of female androgynous models onto my computer to draw or just to look at. 

I came out to my mom as pansexual in 9th grade, and around then started identifying to myself as genderqueer. Why?

I don't feel like a woman. I'm just not. I don't know. When girls talk about ""girly"" things like makeup or shopping for clothes, I tune out. I also usually don't shave anything except armpits, I used to but I don't think there is a point, I only did it before because social pressure. My mom still brings it up sometimes but I refuse to shave just because someone wants me to. It's so weird, I was in a play recently and I had to go in the girl's dressing room and the whole time I felt like they were talking about makeup, foundation, bras... I didn't have anything to contribute to the conversation except say ""no"" to their offers of giving me makeup.

And the costume designer - ugh -, she was like ""are you sure you don't want to put on makeup?"" and it bothered me.

When I was 16 years old I got my hair cut short, and it was the BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! I felt amazing, I loved how I looked, I was just badass and amazing! My face literally HURT from smiling so much in the mirror at the haircut place. It's the happiest memory I can think of.

Then there was about a year ago, my high school prom. I wore a tuxedo. It was a huge drama. My mom basically didn't talk to me for a couple days, and we're usually really close. It was only able to happen because my sister paid for it. My mom left the men's warehouse store in tears because she was ""embarrassed""... how did she think that made me feel? :(

But, after some talking, we finally made up, but damn it was a tough week. I was relieved to be able to go to prom with her support.

(And I looked damn amazing and those pictures from that day are the sharpest I've ever looked.)

Anyway, I remember, she kept asking me, ""Do you want to be a boy? Why do you want to wear this?"" and I just said ""No! No! I just like the way it looks."" I just wanted her to let me wear it.

Then, last fall at college, I bought a binder. I was really excited. I have it, and I like it, but it definitely wasn't as dramatic as getting my haircut. I already have really small boobs, so maybe that's why. I do wear it sometimes when I go out, but back at the beginning I wore it like every day. It felt legitimizing. 

Also, online I use a masculine pseudonym, and usually list my gender as other or prefer not to say. This username I have now is the most obvious its gotten.

I've also, cautiously, started referring to myself as a boy to one of my close friends. For the past few years, when asked my pronouns at queer gatherings, I say ""he and she are both fine.""

I feel not right when I get cards that say ""for my daughter"" and stuff like that. I even made a collage about it where I cut up a card my dad gave me (obviously didn't show that to him, lol).

But the one thing that has puzzled me about transgender as an identity is the dysphoria aspect. I don't get it terribly bad... in fact I've only noticed anything at all very recently. I wonder if I'm just making things up so I can be like ""oh yes I'm trans."" I don't know why I'd want to do that since I know it's a really hard identity to live with... I didn't get a binder because I hated my boobs, I got it because I thought it would look good and also be interesting to try...

OH! And I forgot something important. I identify VERY STRONGLY with certain male characters on television. Maybe this doesn't sound important but there are certain characters I actually consider part of me, so much so that I once considered them as within my conscious. I guess what I'm saying is I've been really obsessed. In particular, I find the gay male identity completely fascinating. I often wish or feel like I should have been a gay man, and that if I were I guy I'd certainly be gay. This shouldn't really make sense since I mostly like females (albeit masculine-presenting) in real life, but it makes sense in my head.

I roleplay a lot online and I always play a gay male character. Even sexually, I imagine men together, despite the fact that I am female and mostly attracted to other females. I feel that if I ever had sex, I would need a partner that would adapt to these fantasies. 

I've had a couple dreams where I had a strap-on, and I also had a dream where I was about to have sex with a man and I was a man, too. I've also had dreams where I have a vagina, though. But the dream where I was a man about to have sex with a man was my favorite.

Maybe there's no reason for me to even be thinking/worrying about this. Unless there's something I want to do, does it matter? I guess I'm trying to make sense of my feelings. And maybe being referred to as a girl has gotten to me, a bit.

Kind words, anyone?",queer

Is kissing romantic or sexual?,"As you know, aromantic and asexual identities are distinct - people can be romantic but asexual, or sexual but aromantic, or sexual and romantic. 


But that makes me wonder - is kissing romantic or sexual to people? I think this can be debated so feel free to discuss your personal ideas!

One argument on the romantic side is that kids movies show it. You know, always. Every Disney movie climaxes (heh) with a kiss of true love, it seems. Kissing seems to be ""innocent"" as long as it isn't prolonged. 

But when you think of cartoons, they often show the character being kissed have their whole body turn red, as if in - arousal?

And of course it's no mystery that kissing can cause arousal. But is it still just ""romantic""?

And what even IS romance? If I cuddle with a friend platonically, which I have, how is that different from cuddling romantically? For me, I call it platonic and simply realize that it will never lead to ""something more"" (which I had to be aware of since I had a crush on the person previously). Then, if we define romance as the flirting, the leadup to sex, getting back to my original question, kissing is sexual insofar as it suggests a lead up to sex.

Obviously, kissing isn't sexual when it's something done out of habit, or in your culture. For example quick pecks on the cheek or lips to children, or in countries that use kisses as a greeting. 

Its also interesting to watch how kissing in television changes as you mature and also in different relationships. For example the kissing in a show like Orange is the New Black is much different than kisses in Disney. In the former, it is much more obviously sexual; in the latter, it just seems like ""OMG LOVE"" but when you think about it pressing your lips to a total stranger you just met seems so obviously compelled by some sexual attraction -

Ah! So much to think about. Anyway, what are your thoughts on this question?

Also is anyone familiar with that lion king clip where Nala gives Simba the bedroom eyes? Pretty amusing.",queer

I'm still a youngen (21) and growing up in Australia, voguing and ""Balls"" didn't happen around me so much as drag performances in the 2 queer venues i have access to in Perth, Western Australia. I can't seem to find any ""notable"" information about the beginnings of the a cappella often spouted ad-lib by the vogue performer or the MC at a Balls and in songs by Rupaul and Bob the Drag Queen.
Examples of the kind of vocalizations i'm referring to are; ""Kack to the kack, kack, kack, kack boom"" and ""Tatata, tatata, tatata, boom""
Hopefully my question makes sense to some of you and i get get some cool new knowledge about one of the oddest yet most fun parts of voguing (personally).

Have you ever been worried about holding your partner's hand in public? (A DePaul University IRB-approved research survey on public displays of affection among LGBTQ+),"Hi /r/queer!

&amp;nbsp;

At DePaul University we are conducting a research study to learn more about public displays of affection (PDA) among gender and sexual minorities (GSM). The research consists of one anonymous survey that can be completed online and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.   The term, ""gender and sexual minorities"", is used in this study to represent the entire spectrum of sexual orientations - such as gay, lesbian, bi, pan, asexual, etc. - as well as people who identify as any minority gender identity - such as transgender, non-binary, or genderqueer, among others (whom may or may not be heterosexual).

&amp;nbsp;
  
In order to participate in this research study you must be a sexual orientation minority, a gender identity minority, or both a sexual orientation and gender identity minority. Some people may prefer to use labels other than ‚Äòsexual minority‚Äô or ‚Äògender minority‚Äô to describe their sexual orientation and gender identity. I use this term in this survey as a convenience, and I ask for your understanding if the term does not completely capture your sexual and gender identity.  This study will examine what makes GSM more or less likely to show public affection.

&amp;nbsp;

To be eligible to participate you must be all of the following: 


* 18 years old or older


* Any gender and/or sexual minority, such as gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, transgender, nonbinary, queer, etc.


* currently living in the United States 


* in a current monogamous relationship for at least one month or have had a past monogamous relationship that lasted at least one month.

(particularly in reference to members of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, asexual or pansexual groups)","https://uwehls.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a8YS2NLZhLezmqV

Hello :)

I am currently an undergraduate psychology student conducting research for my final project. The aim of my research is to explore people's understanding of communities, especially those which are established and maintained through the internet, particularly in reference to members of often marginalised groups (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, asexual or pansexual groups). Recent studies have outlined several benefits related to participating in online interaction although there may also be particular frustrations or challenges in being a member of online communities. I am therefore particularly interested in exploring what motivates members to join an online community, and what their experiences of them are, as well as whether their experiences and behaviours online differ from their experiences in the physical world.

The survey should take no longer than 30 minutes to complete. At no point will you be asked to provide your name or email address if you choose to take part. Instead, you will be asked to generate your own personal ID code. To give me a picture of the range of people taking part in the research, the survey includes a number of demographic questions (e.g., age, sexuality etc). Every effort has been made to ensure all information collected will remain completely confidential and no one be identified at any point during my research.

If you are keen to take part, please follow the link below:

Consistently having feelings for people that aren't romantically or sexually attracted to my sex and/or gender. Looking for thoughts and similar stories.,"I kind of want to express a trouble I've been experiencing and also would like to hear some stories from others who also might be frustrated or dismayed with similar ish. 

I'm a queer cisman (for clarity I mean ""queer"" as I'm  simply not straight) and yet I've had sexual interactions with roughly an equal number of men and women. I've had SEVERAL girlfriends in my life, but never a boyfriend, despite being open and out for years as being far more romantically and sexually attracted to men (perhaps a topic for another time or post). 

I'm at a point where it's extremely difficult to see myself with any woman, but like 98% of the men I'm romantically attracted to are all straight. They mostly have more open personalities - the type of men who wouldn't surprise many if they were gay, but aren't (not necessarily feminine). A lot of times I have feelings for them before I find out they're straight and it KILLS me to know that the very rare guy I'm even slightly interested in pursuing a relationship with couldn't really reciprocate the feelings.

I know there's nothing I can do about it, but it's just really crummy and it's happened so much now that it's got me feelin' a little more down than usual. I'm not looking for any ""oh you'll find someone"" because I'm not actively looking for any kind of relationship, but I would like to know how common this is.

I miss strap-on.org. Anything out there like it?,"I guess the site only ran from 2000 - 2003, but it played a huge role in my life. 

All the feminist webpages these days seem loaded with threads about parenting and crafts. Frankly, I don't really consider these my primary interests. Also, they all seem to lack whimsy. 

There was a genuine sense of community, with regional meetups across the country. 

Were you on the site? What debauchery are you up to now? I don't really remember many screen names, but I sure do miss that place.

Does anybody happen to have the contact info or former handles of the folks who ran it? I'd really like a copy of the forums that were public. The site is excluded from Wayback Machine. ",queer

Question about terminology,"Disclaimer: I know I'm typing this into reddit, and that I have an equal chance of getting no answer, a hundred thoughtful suggestions, or seventeen people fighting in the comments over who can be the biggest dick. It's not a matter of identity; I know how I work, I just want to know what the right vocab is. :)

I am a cisgender woman, who identifies as ""female"" if you ask, but otherwise don't think about it much. That is, I have a female body and it's definitely mine and I like it, but I had a weird childhood and there's a lot of stuff that people assume I've experienced as a ""woman"" that's totally confusing and alien. If someone called on all the women in the crowd to, I dunno, form a bowling team, someone would probably have to poke me to remind me that they probably meant me. I'm a ""woman"" because that's what I look like and I don't care enough to argue with the default guess.

The people I'm attracted to, at least so far, have all been male-bodied. (I might develop a sudden interest in boobs, but I'm in my mid-thirties and it hasn't happened yet, so I'm not gonna hold my breath.) Some of them identify as male but not very masculine, i.e., gender non-conforming. Some of them are explicitly genderqueer/genderfluid, with an identity and/or expression that is intentionally androgynous, wobbles back and forth, or exists 'between'. I don't go for male-bodied people who are dressed up *as* a woman (drag queens are awesome people, but I don't crush on them), but boys in their own dresses are A-OK by me. They basically just have to be comfortable with their male body, because I am totally not qualified to deal with the alternative in the context of a sexual relationship.

(I don't screen for sexual orientation -- when I hit on people, I'm only interested in whether they're available and interested in *me* -- but a lot of the people I've dated turned out to describe themselves as pan or bi. I think this is correlation rather than causation, tbh. If you're a guy who's come to terms with digging other guys, it's probably way easier to come to terms with also not wanting to be terribly butch.)

What's the right word to describe this? I'm not looking for a community or anything; I already hang out with a group of people who are queer in every sense of the word (gender minorities, sexual minorities, generally artistic weirdos) and if nothing else, I am definitely an ""ally"". I just want to know if there's one single word that covers all that up there, or if the description I've already got is the shortest accurate one there is.

I've got a background in sociology/anthropology, so if someone is tempted to go into super-deep academic wankery, do! I've run across the term 'skoliosexal' recently, but 1) it seems to describe an orientation that's *only* attracted to genderqueer/non-binary/'third gender' people, which is not me, and 2) I've never heard it before, which means it's either very new or very niche, and it stands a good chance of being misunderstood.",queer

I just realized I'm queer,"As a kid I always went to the boys section at toy stores and felt bad about it, my clothing never confirmed a gender, sure I always shop at the ladies section, but the random shirts, jeans and skinnies are very gender neutral. 
I always used the term 'gay' instead of 'lesbian' to identify my sexual orientation, just because gay sounds so neutral to me.

The more I read about it, the more I identify with the term Queer. I dislike labels and conformations, I hate it when people say 'man up' 'you sound like a bitch' or that men aren't supposed to cry and females aren't supposed to be strong.",queer

And I want to change that, I want to learn as much as possible about you guys and maybe share this information to some of my friends to help them get a better understanding of the queer community(not sure if I'm supposed to write community sorry.). So Here are some questions that you may found ignorant or plain stupid but please try to understand that this is actual questions I would like to get answered so I get to understand more and help friends to understand as well or to explain to some random comment on youtube. 

Question number one (my question)
_______________________________________________________
Biological the ""female"" and ""male"" body are different and need different care in medical how are someone(a doctor) suppose to know what to give to a certain person? would it work with some sort of number system or how?
______________________________________________________

question number two (internet question)
______________________________________________________
Sorry for this one. This question was from a comment on a buzzfeed video.
What make you feel as neither of the gender?
If you grew up as a boy playing with dolls why aren't you a boy who likes dolls instead of confused or genderless? What if we removed labels so we only hade two genders but made them mean nothing.
I know that that would be hard but why not? (remember it will be hard for me to counter answer this question scenes I didn't question it).
_______________________________________________________

Question number three  (my question)
_______________________________________________________
Do you think toilets should be divided by genitalia or gender?
with toilets i mean more like bathrooms where there are urinal.
_______________________________________________________

Question number four ( internet question)
_______________________________________________________
straight copied from the comment. This comment got 28 likes in 12 minutes so it must be somethings people wonder. This comment is about rasing a child Non-Conforming. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Zem9ILPbc)

What I don't understand is how forcing your child to not follow the ""norm"" of gender identity any different than forcing your child to be straight. You say there're more than 2 genders but how is it that forcing your child to be straight is wrong but anything else is ok? I don't want to sound rude but I just don't get itÔªø

(although for now it doesn't officially have that status until i can afford to do all the paperwork and stuff) I'm wanting to make it an international show for both america but with a focus on other nations too, giving them community in places where it may be dangerous to do so, taking advantage of SW radios radical christian missionary organizations pass out to places they visit. I feel we can offer information on asylumn, give a relatively safe form of community (radio listening can't be tracked), a requiem from the stress of being in such a situation, digital communications in the form of one way text and image transmissions, and of course include our own first world culture, fighting back against bigoted politics and radio stations by claiming our place on the airwaves. Radio is a powerful medium because it can not be tracked, filtered, or blocked. Once the signal starts as they say in the movie ""Serinity"" ""you can't stop the signal"" please have a look at my indiegogo. The transmitter cost for our first month is $200 dollars ($50 per show) american for a one hour show every week. With time we may get better rates even.

We're just baes. I'm queer but he's straight.,"Last night after reading an article on LGBT Nation ‚ÄúCollege guy realizes his best friend might be his boyfriend‚Ä¶‚Äù got me thinking about the current relationship I‚Äôm in.  In the same way that this article details a reddit user‚Äôs friendship, that might be more than a friendship, I came to the realization that the friendship I have with Tommy is the same one but there‚Äôs one big difference. I identify as a queer man and he‚Äôs a straight man. The complexities of our relationship has made many of our friends question our sexualities, but more specifically his. It seems that being in a platonic nonsexual relationship with a queer man disrupts patriarchy and other peoples‚Äô masculinities seem to feel threatened. First let me tell y‚Äôall how I met Tommy. 

Before joining the Salsa team I am a part of I decided to attend one of the social dance nights hosted by the same team. It was there that I met Tommy. As someone who grew up learning to lead, a role predominantly assigned to cis men, I have been continued to only know how to lead. As a queer body I wanted to challenge that notion and take on the role of a follow, a role predominantly assigned to cis women‚Äîasking male leads to lead me as a male follow is a whole different conversation for another post, that brings me to Tommy.

As soon as the dancing started I was immediately captivated by the way tommy danced, right away I knew that I was going to dance with this person before the night was over. After working through the right pitch to have him agree to lead I went up to Tommy and asked him if he would be comfortable leading me. He agreed and I immediately fell in love with the movement. I learned a different side of Latin Social Dance that I was never exposed to due to the fact that it was not acceptable for me as a cis male to follow but as a queer identifying male I was ready to challenge that. After dancing with a couple of other male leads I went back up to Tommy and asked him to lead one more song. He seemed a bit hesitant the second time around so I figured I was probably making him uncomfortable and in my mind I labeled him as a jerk. 

He didn‚Äôt wait long to prove me wrong. Once I auditioned and joined the team it was time to learn our partner choreography where I decided to dance the follow role as a way to challenge all of the other cis men on the team. We were asked to find partners relatively close to our height so my immediate reaction was to go for the taller men in the team. Since Tommy was standing next to me I turned to him and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna be my partner‚Äù to which he agreed.

Fast Forward to today: Tommy is my best friend. I am the ‚Äúgirlfriend he flirts with, but doesn‚Äôt sleep with.‚Äù When we go to rehearsal we‚Äôre always taking snapchats of each other and posting them on our respective stories. I always call him bae and he calls me boo. We text every day from sunrise to sunset, he is always the first ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and the last ‚Äúgood night‚Äù I send. I have met his family and have spent time with his friends and he has met mine. We hold each other accountable and help each other be a better version of ourselves. We have talked about our relationship and the way that it functions and we both came to the conclusion that it feels like we‚Äôre dating. 

This is where it gets complicated. Because I am queer all of my friends believe that so is Tommy. And I always have to say ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù Maybe in the beginning of our friendship I fancied the idea but after the development of our relationship I realized that I would never pressure him into being sexual with me at all. I would never jeopardize the beautiful relationship I have with this person all for some instant gratification that can be found with other queer folk. Tommy is just bae, we function as a relationship that isn‚Äôt sexual and that is fine. The fact that a straight male is loving a queer male this much is political and it‚Äôs helping redefine masculinities. At the end of the day Tommy is my friend, my partner, my homie, my vato, my person. In any vernacular there is always a word for him. 

At the end of the day this type of love is radical. Being loved by a straight cis Latino male the way that Tommy loves me is only a reflection of my community loving me. In a culture where machismo and homophobia are so predominant the relationship I have with Tommy is a way of dismantling those exact systems that have seemed to oppress my queer identity. You know what sometimes your soulmate isn‚Äôt romantic.  ",queer
Survey: Healthy Eating in the LGBT Community and Others,"Greetings,
	You are invited to participate in a research study of healthy eating behaviors in the LGBTQ community and others. The purpose of this study is to examine healthy eating behaviors and related issues.
If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things:
 
	You will complete a one-time online survey on a computer and time of your own choosing. The survey includes requests for information (ex.""With which gender do you identify?"", ""What is your sexual orientation?"", ""Do you consider yourself a vegan?"", ""Are you currently pregnant?"", etc.), as well as two questionnaires about eating habits and feelings towards eating (ex. ""When eating, I pay attention to the calories in my food"", ""I believe some foods are pure and some foods are impure"", ""I think some foods are healthier than other foods"", etc.), and questions pertaining to career and social pressures (ex. ""My career path motivates me to eat healthy foods and take care of myself"") . The survey should take you 15 minutes to complete. The online link will be active until December 13, 2015.

	The study is being conducted by Christian French, a senior at Indiana University Southeast, as a part of his Seminar in Psychology course.

Filming a documentary on Queer sexuality aaannd...,"I have a few questions. 


1) What would you like to see in a Queer focused documentary? (I've done some research and it seems there aren't any specific docs on queer sexuality.) 


2.) What kind of issues/subject matter would you like addressed in terms of your sexuality or life as a queer individual? 


3.) What kind of questions would you find more difficult/controversial to answer? Maybe you're afraid of how other people in the community would perceive you etc.. 


The documentary I'm filming will be focused on the queer community here in Boston, and I'm in the pre-production phase at the moment. I'm looking for ideas. I already have a good amount of queer individuals interested in telling their stories, but I'm looking to also focus on asking the hard questions. The aim is to showcase the community from an unbiased POV but to also illuminate the general public on the evolutionary state sexuality has arrived to (there's still a lot of people who don't even know what 'Queer' means).

Just Need Someone to Talk To,"I had an extremely emotionally abusive roommate. Possibly assaulted me as well, but I had been in the ER the day before for heart problems and was heavily sedated, so I don't really remember. Maybe she was just too touchy in trying to take care of me.

The thing is, I consider myself a bisexual woman, and so did she. We started out really good friends, but she was very needy, so I asked for space. She became extremely jealous and hostile after this interaction, supposedly because I was dating and sleeping with multiple men. I was accused of using women and not actually being interested in them. She would subtly insult my intelligence, looks, ambitions. When it didn't work I was torn apart for being arrogant. Eventually, she screamed at me for hours while I was studying for a final -- not letting me leave our dorm until I was sobbing and threatening to kill myself.

And, even with no evidence, I think she may have assaulted me because since the night where something maybe-sexual might have occurred (the sedatives messed with my memory) I literally can vomit when thinking about the female body sexually. I can't date or flirt with queer girls anymore because I just end up crying without knowing why. I feel like she stole my queer identity.

I am worried I'm becoming homophobic as I am instantly terrified of any butch presenting woman I meet.

No one I have told believes me because she is gender queer and extremely vocal in activist circles. As wonderful as the queer community can be it sometimes protects its own in questionable situations.

I can't talk to anyone about this. I am starting to hate queer women based on one trauma. Please someone tell me how to fix this. I have been debating suicide at times for months even with the help of my lovely boyfriend.",queer
Am I queer? Thoughts?,"So I went on a study abroad program this semester with 25 other people and I realized pretty quickly that there were a lot of LGBT people in the group. I interacted with them and it gave me some motivation to examine myself, and I realize one thing: I might be queer. 

For years, I've strictly identified as a normal heterosexual guy and I still consider myself mostly heterosexual, but I notice that I could also consider myself queer. Sometimes I feel attracted to other men, and I'd say thats about 10% of the time. I've been turned on a couple of times by men, but most of the time I've been turned on by other women. But what really convinced me was that I have a lot of fantasies about being a woman, if only temporarily. I'm attracted to women being carried by men, thats def a fetish of mine. But sometimes I like to roleplay being the woman and then go from there. And I've played female characters in video games and other simulations mostly for the sexual experience.

I feel that in this complicated way, I am a queer. But Im not sure if I can since in my romantic and sexual life, Im still mostly heterosexual. What are your thoughts on this?",queer

PARTICIPANTS NEEDED!,"Hi there,

You are invited to participate in an on-line study that investigates the relationship between aspects of social support, family acceptance and resilience in the LGBTQI community. Social support has consistently been identified as a predictor of resilience in people, however the specific aspects of social support that enable people to achieve resilient outcomes in the face of trauma, stress or adversity are still being understood. The aim of the present study is to explore how aspects of your social supports and family acceptance affect your level of resilience. If you are over 18 years of age and self-identify as LGBTQI, then you are eligible to participate in this research.

If you would like further information regarding this study, please contact the supervisor of the study, Professor John Reece (email: john.reece@acap.edu.au).

I really need some kind help right now.,"These are a bunch of thoughts, I can't get them straight and I just need to talk to someone because I'm going through a pretty rough time right now. 

I just want to stay home and cry. I feel I don't really have anyone else to talk to. And I'm sorry I don't have all these thoughts straight but I just can't just keep holding on to this. 

It's pride weekend here in Vancouver BC. Friday at lunch I met a guy my wife of 12 years dated a few times. He doesn't feel right to me. She gets to make her own decisions. I think he doesn't know what he wants and I am suspicious of his intentions (or lack thereof). My first pride parade 4 years ago, I had been out of a religious cult for about a year. It hit me really hard and and 4 years later I'm still reeling. I learned there is such a thing as non-monogamy and I brought it up to my wife. It was a revolution in my head. She took it hard but ultimately knew it was right. We love each other. I know alot of people say that but I mean it when I say it. She's bisexual and has said many times that she is so lucky that I'm super supportive.

I went shopping for a dress  Friday and found one but not the one I had envisioned. I'm not gay, I may be bi-situational. I'm not a ""cross-dresser"". For me it's not a kink, I just have a vision in my mind of a dude in a dress wearing jack boots and big huge red sunglasses. Being a musician I'm imagining this for a show but my dream of playing mid-size stages isn't true yet so I figure I'll do it for pride because that's allowed right? And people will get it and accept me right? My wife didn't get it and it made me feel gross (though she was very helpful in helping me shop for the dress). I started feeling shame at her reaction to my idea. I'm so hurt! I've been pushing myself so much! Challenging myself at every turn and it just feels like I still have no support network. I've gone to polyamorous meetups, the discussion kind and the just hang out kind and I just don't feel I fit in. I feel so alone. I wish I would get recognized but I feel rejected. I'd like friends who would be allies and support me and be on my side as I try so hard to sort this out but I've been having to do all of this alone and my heart hurts. All I can think to do right now is cry. 

My wife was getting pretty anxious that pride would not work out well and that we'd miss the good parties but I felt worried that I wouldn't fit in. So I researched and found a party that advertises as ""pride is for everyone"" bi, gay, trans, queer, *cis*. I felt there was hope but then I started thinking about actually going and not knowing what to wear, feeling gross about wearing a dress like I wanted feeling dishonest if I wore anything else and I just couldn't go. And now this whole thing just hurts. I need kindness, I need allies. How do I do this? I'm just trying to be myself and hoping someone will recognize me. Fuck, I'm not getting any younger here (37 years old). I don't want to miss the boat and be left behind while the rest of the world has fun and finds community. 

My parents don't love me unless I'm in the same religion as them. Fuck them, I hate them so much! How dare they love me conditionally. They are cruel. I don't know how or where to find love except on the stage playing my music. I want to go to a queer support group but what do I say? I need support for being a probably straight white guy who doesn't know the next step? Is that ok? There's folks out there who are actually gay, or trans and going through hardcore rough times. They need help. And I don't even know what's happening with me? I don't know what the label is. People with a label (queer, trans, gay), they've gone through a lot to wear that label with pride. And reasonably so, they're a little territorial. But I don't how to get in and get support. I can't go to a gay or bi support group because that's not appropriate.  Polly support groups don't seem to have welcomed me. I have an intense face and demeanour, lots of charisma and am attractive, I've learned that people assume that means I'm tough and that I have everything figured out and that it all comes easy to me. I feel rejected and hurt.

I can't expect my wife to support me the way I'd like, she's going through her own tough things right now and she deserves to explore unhindered. I can't expect her to know what I need from her if I don't even know myself. 

I'm sorry for the info dump. I just need to start a conversation with someone about this from a safe distance. Because I don't feel safe anywhere else right now.

If a kind person out there reads this and it resonates or you have it in you to send me a kind message, I'd really appreciate it because I really need some help right now.

I'm going to see the parade now after a good hard cry. It's gonna be tough, because I don't feel very celebratory. Like last year, it's gonna be tough to see others celebrating and being joyful. Because I'd like to be there too. I too would like to know who I am and celebrate it despite everything. I too would like to feel ok having the kind of sex I like and with the people I like. But I can't just hide from everything so I'm facing it anyway. It may not seem like much to some, after all, it's just a parade. But it's difficult for me and I have to go without any friends. Just a straight middle aged white guy in a crowd right? Nothing special going on right? He probably has a decent job and a happy marriage right? Just a regular old monogamous happy man.

This is just so tough right now.",queer

I'm getting romantically involved with a girl for the first time and I don't have anyone to talk to.,"I would define my sexuality as 'fluid' : all my past sexual experiences and SO's have been male, but I have had a grand total of 3 crushes on girls (the current girl being the third).

I am definitely attracted to more masculine types and the girls I've had crushes on in the past have never came to fruition due to me being terrified and unsure of their sexuality and my own definition of my sexuality. 

I met Anna* through work and one night, as a group, we went out to a drag show and afterwards we danced. Anna &amp; I danced together and there was a moment on the dance floor where we looked at each other and didn't stop looking and I felt something, but quickly broke eye contact and shook it off as nothing.

Anna &amp; I texted the next day and it came around to her confessing to me that she is incredibly attracted to me. This was about a month ago and we're seeing each other casually and taking things slowly because she knows I have no previous experience with females and want to go slowly.

Basically, I feel isolated because I have no one outside of Anna to talk about Anna and talk about what I'm going through, emotionally and mentally with this budding relationship.

I talked to another coworker I am close to and basically, she was shocked that Anna has a crush on me and then said, ""I could never do that. I could never be with a girl."" I just felt hurt and confused and haven't reached out to her to talk about Anna since then.

I don't know whether anyone will respond to this or not, but I just want to talk to someone about this because I don't have anyone to talk to that understands what I might be feeling or going through.

"Introducing a new subreddit, QueerKikPals!","Hello all!  As a queer person who likes to chat with internet strangers, I've been frustrated recently trying to carve out a queer space to talk to people.  I am a big kik user (it's a mobile app for instant messaging), but places like /r/kikpals narrow queer identities to a single tag, ""trans.""  Though a useful umbrella term, tagging a post ""trans"" will fill your inbox with both questions about genitals and people who want to objectify your body.

Enter /r/QueerKikPals: it's a private subreddit for non-cis redditors to find platonic and/or dirty chat friends.

No idea where to post this...I don't feel feminine!,"I'm a biological girl and also identify as a girl, but I feel as if my body is very masculine.

Help with identifying myself?,"Hi r/queer,

I've been quietly questioning my gender for a long time, and I'm of course planning to do some formal research, but I wanted to ask some nice redditors their opinions and/or advice as well.

I was born a girl, I like to do my hair and makeup pretty and wear 'girly' things, and I definitely take on the brunt of the domestic work around the house, which I love, but have also been brought up to consider those activities and behaviors pretty sharply feminine. But I'm not sure to what degree those traits can be said to determine my gender. All of my friends from preschool through adulthood have been male because I'm infinitely more comfortable around them than I am with females, although I've definitely warmed up and become less anxious around women in my late 20s. Even as a kid, I never felt like I could identify with most things girls talked about or were into (except boys). Now, on official forms, I generally 'decline to state' my gender when the option is available, and something has just always felt a bit off about checking the 'F' box. When reading over the recent additions to gender choices available on facebook, the definition for 'bigender' felt most right. 

Now, I guess my question is - is that enough to be considered queer or non-binary by the LGBT community? I feel like if I actually edited my profile to bigender or something else, that I'd get a slew of confused comments from friends or strangers who only view me as hyper-feminine. Also, the last thing I would want to do is insert myself ignorantly into a category whose members don't feel I belong. However, I sort of feel like I have the final say so as to what or who I am. What do you guys think? Thanks so much :)",queer

need advice: found nudes on boyfriends comp,"So I was using my boyfriends comp last night and I had to send a photo attachment. When I went to the folder to select, I saw a bunch of dick and ass pics he had taken last summer -- when we were together -- but these pictures were never sent to me.
This normally wouldn't be concerning, but my boyfriend and I have never exchanged nudes the entire 2 years we have been dating. He's really modest, and sometimes even hesistant about changing in front of me.
I love and trust him completely -- and there's nothing that's happened that has suggested he has sent stuff to someone else -- but this just seemed so dramatically out of character both for him and our relationship that I feel strange. I know him so well and it was very surprising for me to see these photos of his boner, etc, when he is very conservative about that kind of stuff. Like, why would he take these extremely sexual photos, just for himself? That wouldn't be like him.
I don't want to say anything to him because those photos are his private property, but it's eating away at me and I don't know what to do. Should I just try my hardest to forget I saw these, and let it go&gt;",queer

figuring shit out/advice please!,"Hi all, I'm posting this to a few different sub-reddits because I really could use some advice..
I'll try not to keep this too long. I am a cis queer(ish) woman who is 21. I say queer(ish) because I'm still figuring stuff out. For most of my life I identified as hetero....up until about 6.5 months ago when I realized I had this really really intense crush on a classmate who is non-male identified. This totally changed my perspective on my sexuality...its been such a roller-coaster for me. I'm beginning to identify less as straight and more as queer. I'm realizing that I am finding myself more and more attracted to women and gender non-conforming folks. I've told lots of friends and even tried to talk to my parents about it (something which I regret because I was not ready at all)...but I still am not publicity identifying as queer, to me it just still seems kind of scary...and I have been struggling with internalized homophobia...also, I still have feelings for my classmate who started me questioning. I told them about my feelings for them a few months ago, but they don't feel the same way. There has been other drama(ish) stuff that happened between us, that just makes things even more complicated. I feel heartbroken whenever I think about them. My queerness seems so related to them....that coming into my queerness seems really fucking painful, because queer romantic/sexual feelings in my mind are still related to them....I'm also beginning to develop a crush on a queer/gender non conforming friend of mine...and fuck....I'm scared because they are in a monogamous relationship...and the last thing i need is queerness being associated with more heartbreak/pain. Part of me wants to say ""Okay, I'm queer"" but there is another part of me holding back....and I really want to break through that...but part of me doubts that I'm queer, even though deep down I know I'm most likely not straight....I don't know why I question this. (my family/friends are very very accepting of lgbtq+ folks)

Sorry for this long rambling post, but I guess I want to know that I'm not alone...I'd also like advice from people who've been in my shoes before.

Any advice that you could give I would really appreciate, thanks so much :)

"Looking for help with an lgbtq youth project, please submit your stories!","[x-posted]

I am compiling a collection of personal stories and anecdotes for a book that will be given away (at no cost) to schools and students. I want to do this for a couple reasons:

1. To help spread awareness of our community and some of the things we go through, especially in our youth. Also, to make people aware of little known genders and orientations that they may otherwise be ignorant about. Awareness often brings acceptance, which is very important to the members of our community.

2. Second, because it was the anecdotes and stories of others much farther along in their gender journey than I that helped me to realize my own identity as nonbinary. I want this to help anyone else struggling with their identity to discover who they truly are by giving them something they may be able to relate to.

So, if you are trans/queer/gay/bi/asexual/demiromantic/pan/or in any other way a part of the lgbtq community and would like to contribute your story to this project, please do so, and help me help our struggling youth. I am especially looking for stories about your journey, before and as you realized your true gender and orientation. Anything from difficulties you faced, to the times you realized for the first time you were not exactly like all of your peers, or anything else you find important enough to share.

Unless you specifically add a name to attribute the story to, it will remain anonymous, rather you submit it anonymously or not.

Please send all submissions, questions, and offers to assist with the project to:

"At 51, I'm going to define myself as queer - not gay, queer.","What does this mean to me? First off, I'd be traditionally considered a straight black male. Loved girls since day one. But at six, I was sexually assaulted by an older boy, at 14 I'd had consensual sexual relationship with a 25 year old female cousin. It ain't been some straight and narrow path. 

I've had a few long term relationships but I've never been married and I'm pretty sure I never will. Never had kids and not seeing how that will ever happen considering where I am now.

Today, I consider myself largely asexual, as in as much as I'd like companionship, for the last several years I've been non-sexual (2 one-night stands and a strip bar.) I masturbate but only occasionally and more as a sleep aid or a pipe cleaner. Looking at traditional porn leaves me sad and wistful (not attracted to gay porn or men at all) so I usually rub one out to T-girls which seems to be my preference.  I've even had my share of t-girl escorts and even dated three in my younger, wilder days but the truth is anal sex with a t-girl is kind of not my thing. At some point fecal matter on my penis is inevitable and I don't like that. Also, I don't like the little things that differentiate MTF trans bodies from CIS female bodies namely the lack of vagina... but I have no problem with a small, ""feminine penis"" (which makes sense when you see a pretty, delicately framed t-girl. Recently, I've entertained the thought of having a t-girl peg me, as much  for the sensation of her laying on my back and grinding (my favorite thing for a female to do to me.)

I think this confession might be way to get ownership of myself in a way I've never done. Because I figure if you define yourself, there's no box they can put you and I think I'm queer (or Q in some circles.) 

Full confession, this woke me up. It's something I've thought about for years but didn't know how to work it out. I never felt gay but knew I was something other than straight (I guess.)",queer

Why same-sex marriage is annoying...,"...because there are literally 2-3 wedding ""congratulations"" cards that are appropriate in any card store we visit. And they all suck.

My wife and I have 2 dear friends who, despite being together for &gt;20 years, have been unable to be married in Pennsylvania. Well, thanks to our courageous attorney general, we finally have marriage equality! Which is awesome, and, our dear friends, as of yesterday, have tied the knot!

So, this brings me to the problem. We stopped in hallmark first, only to discover that half of the cards in the entire wedding section referred to ""his and hers"" ""she and him"" ""husband and wife"" ""man and wife"" ""mr and mrs"" or something else based on traditional marriage. Then, the rest of the cards usually had pictures of wedding cakes, with a topper of a man and a woman, or silhouettes of a man and woman, etc. The few that didn't fall in that group were either ""to the grooms"" or ""mr and mr"", but they all were meant for brand new couples. The interior messages saying things like, ""Congratulations on your new journey!"" which would be great, except they've been living together for well over 20 years.

So, on to papyrus.

SAME DAMN THING. Seriously, check out their website:
http://www.papyrusonline.com/greeting-cards/wedding-cards/same-sex-wedding-cards.html

Those are just the explicitly ""same sex"" cards, but the rest of their wedding cards nearly all have some other sort of problem with them.

We finally found a card wishing them congratulations on their marriage, and telling them to have a fantastic life together. It's simple, sweet, and gets the point across. 

But seriously? That was frustrating! What's worse is that they're pretty popular guys, and I am pretty damn sure that someone else out of their scores of friends is going to get them the same damn card! I mean, they really have like 8 total to choose from.

On the upside, the store clerk in Papyrus came out to us when we told him what we were looking for, and we ended up talking and laughing for about a half hour about the absurdity of the lack of cards for same-sex marriage.

So, someone needs to start a business, pronto. I'm delivering the business idea to you here. Go for it! Make some millions!",queer

Could you help me find some academic sources about fluidity in female sexuality please? (x-post),"Hello!  I am writing a research paper for my college LGBTQ psychology class, and the topic is about fluidity in female sexuality.  Could any of you help me in finding some academic sources relating to this?  It can include information on lesbian-identified women, straight-identified women, bisexual-identified women, queer-identified women, ""heteroflexible"" women, ""barsexuals,"" any experimentation, etc..  Also since this is a research paper, all of my sources have to be from peer-reviewed journal articles or books.  Thanks!",queer
WHAT TO EXPECT When You Tell Someone You're A Lesbian,,queer
All I wanted was To love and be LOved,"‚ÄúAll I want is love‚Äù
(Part I)
First wound
When I was a kid all I was told by my parents and teachers that we are supposed to spread the message of love that god has blessed all of us with. Ever since my kinder garden days I was fascinated by the idea of falling in love‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ when I was I my teens I was so much dreamy about what would it be like when I fall in love‚Ä¶.will the violins play and butterflies fly and was nearly sure that the time will stop for that moment when I see the love of my life standing right in front of me. For me love was the most passionate moment as they say in mills n boons, the strongest emotion which triumphs over every evil of life like our Bollywood movies describes.
It was a kind off a aim of my life to fall in love with someone.
By then I didn‚Äôt knew the concept of cast, community, religion, sect, color or any form of discrimination until our great education system actually sowed a seed of casteism and likely terms in form of knowledge in my dumb mind. 
I got my education from a public school which isn‚Äôt very fancy but the best my parents could afford and mind it I was the best student they ever had (they certified it on my farewell) so all the high society urbane stuff was a bit alien to me.
Well it was my ninth grade I remember clearly immediately after the science period in which we came across a term of artificial insemination, since I was more of a loner in school so I was always into reading books, henceforth I had read theory of reproduction like in my 6 or 7 grade so it wasn‚Äôt new to me at all. And my class mate asked me what it was so, me being a super helping hand explained it all in detail to him. And he just asked me how many times did I jerk off out of all the blue‚Äôs‚Ä¶..well I must say I was a bit startled that where did this come from, so I just said may be twice or sometime thrice a day and sometime not even once in weeks. 
And the discussion went on and he asked me how did my thing looked like and I told him and I reciprocated the same question and he told me. I found his description a bit dissimilar to me so I went home and opened my books and found out what was that difference and it came to me that he‚Äôs circumcised, so it was all clear in my head all over again.
Few days later it was all summer vacations going on and I was home with my mom enjoying my vacation (they sucked badly I hated staying home), I normally had to stay indoors because my parents won‚Äôt just let me go out and play on streets so me got all back into my books again. They one day the same class mate called me up and asked about my holiday homework and all. And they some days later he called me again and I was kind of happy that may be I have finally made one friend yeppie. Then once I called him and he said he was busy and will call me later, and after like 20 min or so he called me back and we started chit chatting, he was kind a bit too excited so I asked him what‚Äôs up so he told me he was watching a porn flick and told me what it was and stuff, I didn‚Äôt had computer at my house or DVD player or even CD player at my place so I was not into them, in fact I didn‚Äôt even knew what it was. So I went to my dictionary and found what it was. And I was, to use a proper word super horny and wanted to see it. So I asked my friend. He refused me as his parents were home and a 10 more reasons. So the idea just faded away lately but with a nice time in visualization of course.
Then vacations gone by and school came up and usual school routine. My friend started having lunch with me, it was a shock to me because I was the last person whom anybody in whole school would talk because they thought I was a jerk who stayed into books and sissy because I loved art when other boys liked football and maybe a million more reasons and yes I was a cry baby. Sobbing over every senti thing. But him sitting over lunch with me was something I never expected. So I was definitely happy, over lunch we talked about various things 90% about pornos and sex though, the changes coming in our bodies and girls and all. One day I again asked him if he could show me porno. So he said I‚Äôll have to show him my thing, well it wasn‚Äôt big thing for me because I thought he‚Äôs a guy I am a guy and yes I wanted to see a circumcised thing. 
So it was a deal and I was amongst the students on duty to send students to classes after lunch break from grounds and I was allowed to enter class 10 min later in lecture. So I asked him to accompany me and after the student were gone we went to washroom, entered the a small cabin for pooping and I stood in front of him shying like a girl, so he showed his thing first and obviously I was oh!!! Wao‚Ä¶then I showed him mine. He touched my and smiled and said ‚Äúyours is big and funny‚Äù well I was super hard and he was semi. But the funny element was my foreskin going up and down. We smiled and he said lets jerk off. 
I knew we had 7 mints and that would be enough so we started and then I don‚Äôt know who did it first but we held each other‚Äôs thing and jerked each other off. Then we entered the class happy happy and I was super excited because he invited me to his house next week. 
Then 2 days later we landed up in the bathroom once again but this time he had something in his hand well it was like a greasy balloon rolled in nearly impossible tight role, and I was guessing in mind what it could be and he told me that it was condom. It was quite different from what I had imagined from books but it was eyuck! The greasy was too smelly. He said he wanted to try something and he said if I participated equally and didn‚Äôt tell anyone about it then I will have unlimited access to him house i.e. pornos. So I told him yes. And next thing I knew was that he wanted me to bend over and I did. Then he rolled that condom on his hard male member and tried to thrust it into my butthole. It was the sharpest and the most painful physical pain that I ever experienced. I tried to stop but couldn‚Äôt help gasping and low screams. I asked him to stop and tried to withdraw myself but he held me tight. And tried again but his thing was too large for my tight hole to penetrate. 
Then he asked me to stuff my handkerchief in my mouth. I knew if I screamed then the washroom maid would come in and we will get busted badly and suspended. And after all I had first said yes to the deal so I did it and put my handkerchief in my mouth. And then all I knew was that tears were rolling down my cheeks and I had immense uncontrollable painful moment in my life, then in few more strokes he was completely inside me and it was even more painful and he was thrusting himself in me again and again fast and hard. It was a nightmare. But I controlled myself from breaking down and became bold enough to ask him to stop and let me go. But he pacified me that it was just about to get over. And I could do the same to him but maybe there was something else in my mind that I didn‚Äôt wanted him to go through that pain. (We‚Äôll get to that later). Then he had his first real sexual orgasm as I put it. And he withdrew himself and kissed me on cheek saying thanks and left the cubicle along with me lying there withering in pain trying to hold both of my thighs and cheeks firmly together as possible. Finally picking my courage I touched myself deep down there and when I saw my hand then all my tears went dry and it just blacked out for a moment it was blood. I was scared and frightened, but thanks to whatever thought came into my mind at that moment I just washed myself but it was still bleeding and I still had to go to my class and attend the next 3 lectures before school could get over so all I did was fold my handkerchief and place it like a pad in the inners of my butts and wear my pants.
I don‚Äôt know what I should call the phenomenon that happened in that bathroom cubicle. But I was not the same person coming out of it, I was somehow a new person. 
I had always been loner and quite in my life whose face never said much to anybody. So I knew all I had to do was make a dead face and walking into my class upto my desk and sit down and wait for school to get over.
But I don‚Äôt know why I felt that everybody I crossed from the ground floor to fourth floor till my classroom looked at me in a very very creepy way. And was mocking at me and I felt like a laughing stock. But I walked and entered my class and sat next to the guy to whom I had lost my virtue.
We didn‚Äôt talk the whole time it was I guess awkward silence in between us. And after the school got over I went home unable to ride my bicycle or walk properly so I deflated my bicycle wheel and took a rickshaw home and went to washroom as soon as I could and took a long shower and cried my heart out and washed all the wounded area. And when mum asked me why am  I looking so devastated the reply I gave was my favourite girl in a novel died in to story without meeting her love and she laughed at me. And all she said was ‚Äúson, that‚Äôs life‚Äù her words had meant something quite different to me.
 Few days later as the second part of the deal he invited me to his home, introduced me to his family and they were really good very good to me, god bless those noble people. Then we went to his room and started talking and he showed me his video games and stuff and we played Mario for a while, soon his parents left for office and some places wherever they had to, and he logged in to his internet and we watched porno. And then out of nowhere he got gay porn on and showed me how it was being done and it was cool. I felt a bit relieved that it was not un-natural and I wasn‚Äôt the only one who got my ‚Äúass fucked‚Äù.
Then we jerked off and thank god he didn‚Äôt have condom and we didn‚Äôt wanted to do it bareback thankfully I had read a lot about STD‚Äôs (AIDS to be precise) or else I would have been doomed. And then few days later he got me a card saying ‚Äúto my best friend‚Äù I was in heaven. Yes may be I was in love with him and maybe he too. And I was happy about it in fact super-duper happy. 
For me it wasn‚Äôt that I was in love with a guy or girl which mattered, what made difference to me was that I was in love and I had to be honest and loving to my partner. Though he never said that he loved me or anything of that kind but may be my ass-o-holic mind thought he was. We started hanging out together in breaks. And it was fun. And then once we were at his home I had bunked my tuition and then again we did it. It was again that very painful for me and I did cry but he hugged me later and I was kind of fine and happy.
I was in love, I blushed when he was around me, butterflies did fly and even violins played the most romantic tunes, all off a sudden life seemed to have found a meaning. Rain felt as if it was a blessing and everything was beautiful.
Well it was exactly one month later when he was absent in class and one of his friends came to me and said ‚Äúhey, launde/faggot!!! I know your little secret, but don‚Äôt worry it will remain a secret as long as I get something similar‚Äù and then he told me all had happened between me and my ‚Äúso called love‚Äù with details. And my castles of love had the earthquake and they were in ruins. 
My only reply to that fellow was ‚Äúgo ahead and tell everyone and I will make sure that you and your friend are suspended in a RAPE case‚Äù though I was hurt enough to do it. But that bastard saint in me told me leave it. It happened because I was the one who invited it. Now shut up and forget it. And also I was too attached to him that I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him at all. I just wanted him to be happy even if it was on my cost. 
But I did dare to go and ask him a question ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù and all I got as an answer was that ‚Äúdude! Everyone knows you are a sixer/ launda/gay/bondu/gandu etc etc. and I thought you might help me lose my virginity and you did.‚Äù
Well, all I did was cry for like whole ninth and tenth grade till I became too involved in my studies that I didn‚Äôt had time to think.
I don‚Äôt still have an answer to my question ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù but this time it‚Äôs not for him, this question is for someone deep within me.
I just loved someone without knowing what love was. For me it was special and I was honest. 
Off all those years of being all alone, being commented on, being tormented on, being insulted all I wanted was someone who could just stand by me and say ‚ÄúI am his friend and I am proud of him‚Äù.
All I wanted was to love and be loved.
I lost my virtue when I was 14 years old (13‚Äô July‚Äô 2004)

"Hey queers, are there any movies/tv shows in which queer ladies and queer gentlemen are actually buddies? I feel like almost everything I've seen has either been about gay men OR gay women.","So I've recently discovered and fallen in love with the web series Kelsey (www.congestedcat.com/kelsey--check it out if you haven't, but don't read the description on the site, it doesn't do justice), and part of what I like about it is that it's super refreshing to see a show about a close group of friends of different sexual orientations (and races). There are some things I don't like about the show too, and there are plenty of movies about just queer men or just queer women I like, but since watching Kelsey I've sort of had an itch to watch something not specifically about gay men or gay women, but about, well, queers. And I've found that itch difficult to scratch.

I dunno. I'm a lesbian and I have friends all over the spectra of of sexuality and gender. I'm also a writer, and kind of a nerd about stuff like the role of narratives in shaping our identities etc., and I think there's a lot of power in seeing one's experience rendered in art and/or popular culture. And I guess what I'm saying is, I'd like to see this particular aspect of my experience rendered. 

So: queer buddy movies? Movies in which queer men and queer women (and if possible queer non-binary people, although that might be setting the bar a little high for pop culture) don't live in separate worlds, but in fact play important roles in each other's lives? The only one I'm really thinking of is But I'm A Cheerleader. Anything else? Am I missing something obvious?",queer

Leave a voicemail to participate in making ART about GENDER.,"CALL TO PARTICIPATE IN MAKING ART! I am a queer artist making a video art piece on the gender binary. So:

If you have EVER felt like your gender and your biological sex were not in harmony, or if you have ever crossed gender boundaries; if you ever thought gender ""rules"" were standing in the way of you doing what you wanted to do; if you have ever played with taboo regarding gender, I'm interested in getting a voicemail from you. Here's what I'm looking for: please think of a statement you think is powerful regarding your gender. The tone can be funny, grave, intellectual, provocative, whatever you'd like. It should be one to three sentences long, and start with the phrase ""I don't..."" Then call the Google Voice mailbox for this project at (617) 356-8092, and leave me your message. When you call it will first ask you your name. Then it will ring a few times and the voicemail will pick up.

Your messages will be used as part of an audio collage laid over video of ""The Pink Aisle"" (the aisle of pink toys ""for girls"" in Walmart, Toys R Us, etc.). Even though the images will be of the Pink Isle, I'm very interested in including people of ALL genders and sexes. It's also worth pointing out that I'm interested in hearing from you regardless of whether you identify as straight, queer, cis, or trans. All people have experiences of gender roles confining them, and all degrees of that experience are valid.

NOTE: Feel free to submit anonymously OR give your name. If you provide a name, be sure to spell it for me. Anyone who would like to provide their name will be credited in the video, and I will share it when it's done (probably around April 2014) on my new Vimeo channel, which is user24340142.

Most of you probably already know that LGBT rights are under attack, what many do not realise is that they are citing the laws as they were originally proposed. Before being passed the language in those laws has been changed to make them more encompassing. Current laws do not speak of ""gay propaganda"", they outlaw any propaganda that states that any ""non-traditional"" sexuality or gender identity is normal.

Of course, LGBT community is currently the first one that feels the force of these laws, and it is great that international LGBT community realises the importance of working across the state borders. However, throughout this struggle it would be helpful to seek more alliances then divisions.",queer

I am completing a PhD in Psychology looking at the factors that relate to self-perceived sexual attractiveness. 

I am looking for men and women over the age of 18 to complete an anonymous online questionnaire. I have had a great overall response in other subreddits but would like a larger homosexual and bisexual representation in my sample.

The questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and may be carried out in your own time and in your own environment. 

I imagine the results from my study will be interesting to most of you and as a thank you I will post a document detailing my results (when I have them) to Reddit.

I hope you enjoy the study and maybe learn a little about yourself through completing it!

What does queer mean to you?,"I think most of us find the label ""queer"" empowering because of its versatility, and it means a lot of different things to different people. One of my favorite uses is it can be an umbrella term to include anyone in the LGBT community that doesn't identify as L-G-B-or-T (but don't consider themselves straight).

But I also identify as queer specifically, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. So tell me, queerit, what does ""queer"" mean to you? I'll start:

* Queer for me means I don't experience categorical attraction. Gay people are attracted to the same gender, categorically. Straight people to the opposite gender. Bi people are categorically attracted to both, while pan people are categorically (or hypothetically) attracted to anyone across the gender spectrum. NOTE: this does not mean they're attracted to EVERYONE, but simply that they view the opposite/same/any gender as a category to which they are attracted, while individuals may or may not conform to their standards of attractiveness for that category.
* I don't experience this. I'm attracted to people on a much more case-by-case basis, and I have trouble finding ways to describe the kinds of people I'm attracted to in categorical terms.
* At the same time, I'm not attracted to all points on the gender spectrum, as a rule, which is why I'm uncomfortable with pansexual. So one thing queer does is let me distinguish myself from pan. It also lets me distinguish myself from straight, which I get mislabeled as a lot (I'm male who has been dating a woman for more than a year; most people misinterpret my heterosexual behavior as definitive of my sexual identity).
* If I had to pin down my sexuality, I would say I'm attracted to a) women who perform as masculine, b) women who perform as feminine, and c) men who perform as feminine. But as I say that I'm thinking of exceptions and realizing that this is an artificial imposition, although it does help me understand myself a bit better.


So there you have it. Obviously I've thought about this a lot, so I welcome your thoughts and your personal stories, if you're willing to share.

The Queer Movement is so important...but its language excludes people with limited education.,"Please, please, for the love of what's good, can we move past post-modernistic language?

A quote from a link previously submitted: ""It is within our aesthetic and subjective multiplicity that I feel firmly confident describing ourselves as part of a queer moment, a moment that refuses singularlity, a recombinant moment, a complex collision of discreet historical moments embodied by variegated aesthetics.""

I am a college-educated person, and I have no idea what this means.  The people who really stand to benefit the most from the support and information of the queer community (think a young high schooler living in a rural area) probably have no idea what it means.

But, you say, these are complicated ideas and they need complex language.  No, they don't.  If Howard Zinn can explain the wrongdoings of the US throughout its history at a high school reading level, so can you.

There's something almost classist about writing this way.  Feminism is starting to abandon it, and the Queer movement should, too.

Aside from that however I also have had urges to look at gay porn and straight porn alike, When I walk around campus my eye's only do double takes for girls and I never catch myself thinking about wanting to be with a guy. But I will still get urges to look at gay porn even if only a day earlier I looked at straight porn. I keep going back and forth with what I think my sexuality is and its driving me insane. Please help does this sound like I'm gay , bi , or straight

Do you ever just feel sorry for straight people?,"To most of them, their sexuality is as cut and dry as being straight. Their sex life is vanilla and cisgendered, though they're unaware of those terms. They're spoonfed their sexuality while in the meantime we're out here exploring it, and we've very often found it's not as cut and dry as that we're gay. I think of queerness as a healthy ideal for all humanity to strive for, moving away from heteronormativity. But instead, the ""*gay* rights"" movement has led to the development of homonormativity, to appease people who look down at sex and gender as nothing more than incidental things you shouldn't have to think about ever. This frustrates and saddens me.

How can we as a community encourage straight people to join us as more than just allies?",queer

I can't tell if I'm gay ... I need help :(,"For a couple months now I've realized my feelings for guys, but the problem I'm dealing with is I still have feelings for girls. There is this one guy who every time I see, I smile, I'm giddy, it's as if I have a crush on him. I can't tell whether or not it's because he is so positive and upfront about his sexuality and I'm just attracted to that, because I'm told by my friends that when I'm not in a relationship that I'm an asshole and depressed.

/r/Queer Logos,"Since this group is now starting to get more active, I thought it'd be nice to have a custom logo.  You can [see them here](http://lgbterrific.imgur.com/queer_logos).  I wasn't really sure what type of logo to design.  There really isn't much of a queer symbol or flag- only the rainbow glbt flag.  As mentioned by Rebel (mod of this group) when we were discussing this, the rainbow's a bit overdone.

I tried working from [LGBT Symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_symbols) at Wikipedia, but nothing really helped.  There is, however, a flag for the [anarcho-queer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-queer) movement, consisting of pink and black.  I was hesitant to use that, since this group isn't an anarchy group (although there is that perspective present).  It does make for a good background, however.

I've also been working on different logo ideas for [/r/bisexual](http://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual).  Some of those logos, or ideas from them, can also be used for the logo here.  Feel free to [check them out](http://lgbterrific.imgur.com/bisexual_logos).

Are queers radical?,"After reading through some of the 5th edition of [The Pink and Black](http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/from-the-pink-and-black-attack-collective/) e-zine, and seeing the [Austin Queerbomb pride event](http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=106663), I began to wonder if ""queer"" is a radical term (as used by Bash Back News).

It's an umbrella term that's all-inclusive for the LGBTABC community (or any non-normative sexual/gender identification).  Does the term imply a more radical thought about nonconformity, or is it a normalized umbrella term that nonconformists also happen to use?  Is the word queer implicit in nonconforming, or is it merely a word for inclusive?  

I guess by its very nature, queer individuals accept nonconformity; but do they also accept conformity, even for those who are GLBT (i.e., is conforming necessarily a bad thing)?  Is there an active queer movement to push for ""the odd"" (who aren't necessarily anarchists), and how is it that they wish to not conform (and want to see different)?  Is the movement trying to simply not conform, or are they trying to change society as a whole so there is no conformation at all?

"Usage of the word ""queer""","""Queer"" seems like an odd word.  It has a history of being used as a pejorative (and still can be).  More recently, the word's been used in more positive light (""taken back"").  I think it's moved away from the definition meaning odd/strange, except in a few rare instances.  In many ways, simultaneously used as a pejorative that can be yelled out by homophobes trying to insult and insight fear; and a term of empowerment and inclusiveness of orientations (or genders) that aren't ""normal.""  Some people embrace the term, others dislike it.  Thoughts about it?  Is it a ""bad word?""  Should it be used by the glbt community if so many individuals dislike it?

Today I Realised That I Am the Ultimate (Queer) Heterosexual,"That's right.  Today I realised that I am the ultimate heterosexual...and still queer as hell.  I'm a mid-hormonal transgender woman and was describing how my attractions are to a friend and realised that the only gender I'm NOT generally attracted to are those who identify as trans* women.

My own gender.

I am attracted, however, to cismen, ciswomen, transmen, and genderless folks (and most possibly intersex, though I don't know that I've ever known any).  But just not **my own** gender.  The dictionary definition of heterosexuality is ""a sexual attraction to (or sexual relations with) persons of the opposite sex.""  Well, in a non-binary world (fucking dictionaries), the ""opposite sex"" would be anyone who identifies differently than you.  

Which means I fall under the category of heterosexual.

My mind is still trying to process how absolutely round-about and absurd this is, and I'm pretty sure I made my queer, activist friends' brains all melt out of their ears

I hereby dub this sexuality ""heteroqueer"" and I will love it forever and ever, amen.",queer

If gender were a cherry pie...,"Found this on a message board for androgynes a few years back, thought it was amusing (albeit label heavy, which I'm not too keen on, though it was helpful when I was just learning that there was more to the binary gender world).

If Gender were a cherry pie...

* Cisgender individuals would contentedly eat their designated half.

* Transsexuals would throw away their assigned half, and eat the other half.

* Transgenderists would eat the top half, and pay no mind to the flaky pastry below.

* Crossdressers would eat half, and happily wear the other half.

* Transvestic Fetishists would eat half, and save the other half for the thrill of it.

* Drag Queens would sprinkle the entire pie with sequins, and put it on spotlight display.

* Drag Kings would bind one half and pack the other half, while humming ""Putting on the Ritz"".

* Shemales would insist on top billing in ""How to Have Your Cherry Pie and Eat It Too"".

* Intergender folks would eat the very center, but avoid the outer edges.

* Bigender types would alternately munch on either half.

* Ambigender individuals would alternately eat both halves too, using both hands.

* Third Genders folks would substitute ingredients and bake a brand new type of pie.

* Omnigender individuals would cherish the entire pie, except for the extreme outer crust.

* Neutrois would throw away their alloted half, and do nothing with the other half.

* Pangender folks would complain that there wasn't enough pie for everyone.

* And... Gender Transcendent types would eat chocolate cake and be delighted that everyone else had damn good cherry pie.
