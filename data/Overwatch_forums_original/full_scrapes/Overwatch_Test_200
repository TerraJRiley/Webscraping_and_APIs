"Hi everyone, We've continued to see a heavy influx of conversations revolving around today's hero balance updates impacting Mercy. In an effort to consolidate feedback and create a consistent location for users to share their impressions or opinions, please use this thread. MercyValkyrieNo longer makes Resurrect instantNo longer grants a bonus Resurrect chargeThe speed bonus Guardian Angel receives when activating Valkyrie has been decreased by 50%Duration reduced from 20 seconds to 15 secondsDeveloper Comments: Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her, but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes. Additionally, we’re toning back the amount of mobility Valkyrie provides through Guardian Angel and reducing its duration to overall reduce the power of this ability.We appreciate your feedback, as it will assist us and provide insight on improving your Overwatch experience.

We recognize that people were having fun with the exploit but it caused server instability and negatively impacted other players which is why we have removed it. We really want to bring functionality like this to Overwatch and we’re doing research now into how we can support these custom game settings.

"Hi everyone, We wanted to take some time to explain the recent movement changes in depth (with examples). Hopefully this will help everyone better understand what changed, and what did not.Incline Changes:There were two persistent issues with movement on inclines that we wanted to clean up.First, while moving diagonally on inclines you would end up being slightly strafed left or right even if you were only attempting to move forward. This can be a subtle source of aiming issues for many people, and now the player will properly move forward in this situation.  Second, movement up and down inclines had inconsistent speed as compared to the ground. Running both up and down an incline would be faster than walking on flat ground.  However faster movement (e.g. McCree’s Combat Roll) would be slower when going up and down inclines. Having consistent character movement speed is important for many reasons, the biggest of which is it allows you to be able to reliably know how to aim your hitscan shots or lead your projectile fire.Acceleration changes:The characters in Overwatch have a fixed acceleration (how fast they can change their movement velocity) depending on if they are in the air or on the ground.  Previously, this amount would get reduced if you were attempting to change your direction by 90 degrees or less, and was more pronounced if you were going faster than normal (e.g. Winston’s Jump Pack or Doomfist’s Rocket Punch). One of the consequences of this was that if you were in the air travelling forward and wanted to move directly right, you could reach full speed to the right faster if you accelerated backwards to a full stop and then moved to the right, as opposed to simply pressing to the right. Having to do a non-intuitive movement to reach your desired direction as fast as possible is less than ideal, so we made a change to allow you to more consistently use the air acceleration you already had to reach the direction you'd like to be moving in.The new acceleration can feel like momentum is no longer conserved like before, but the forward velocity is just more efficiently being converted into sideways velocity. The direction is changing faster but your overall speed isn’t being slowed down.  Examples: If you're flying as Pharah, you can now just press forward and you will properly accelerate moving forward, instead of having to counter accelerate to stop sideways drift. If you’re leaping as Winston, you can more effectively redirect your velocity around corners. Prior to this rework it was possible to achieve similar mid-air turns by always facing your current velocity while strafing, but this was also unintuitive.You can now press forward and right directional inputs after a Winston leap and you will actually move some to the right, whereas previously you would have to only hold right if you wanted to get any acceleration to the right.It does mean getting used to the new strafing power. No longer do you have to hold strafe for a long time to get a small adjustment to your movement, you can simply short hold or tap it as needed, and pressing forward with a left or right command will do smaller adjustments than if pressing left or right alone.This does not substantially affect movement when trying to change movement direction by >90 degrees.Additionally, left and right strafing on the ground and air will be the same along with attempting to accelerate against a knockback will be the same.We’re keeping an eye on these changes to make sure everything is working correctly. Any feedback would be appreciated, and would be especially helpful with any screenshots or videos.","

"Hmm, so it doesn't sound like it's too impactful for heroes just jumping up and down to avoid being shot, which is good. Don't think people would accept a Genji buff, as he primarily goes left-right-left-right during battles, and that's >90.","

Possibly if players wished to do something other than 2/2/2 they could select other options like 1/3/2.This system seems to work in other role/class based games and I feel like it would greatly decrease toxicity and encourage players to play other roles (DPS would probably have a slightly longer que).Im posting this idea to receave feedback and possibly be noticed.","

"- His play style favors pushing a team around them, her's is about making a   blockade around her.  I.E. He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.  Orisa shield 900 health, CD.Both have their purposes and usage, so I see both as interchangeable depending on the team needs and situations.","

"i stopped playing Comp when your SR effects your QP match making. I noticed that smurff accounts with almost NO gametime are winding up on QP, with an SR rating similar to mine. I made the motion to STOP climbing with my SR because of my direct feelings of Discrimination in Comp. Comp is very ""grey"" in color with no diversity. I thought this game was about diversity, comp does NOT reflect these same values that blizzard states they are about. I watched on youtube,  their Director of game design and their voice actor hiring person talk about diversity in this game and how important it was to blizzard. However since Comp does not respect this business model. I have silently protested this season for this reason.The other reason is, we are given SR only based upon w/L, which means are outcome has been pre-determined by blizzard, BEFORE we started the game. I should be awarded for efforts, NOT win/Loss. I don't know of ANY game out there, other than overwatch that does this.For example: Blizzard determines the best team for you to match with, the player skill rating for them is good. However 2 or 3 of these randomly at will, these players decide that spending 90% of the time T-bagging someone in the comp-match is a better use of their time. Guess what, you just lost the game and not because you chose to. No matter how hard you played, those 2 or 3 players that are bagging around, have costed you, your game! ""so report them"". Yeah thats great, they get banned, I still get the loss and the penalty.","

That being said, it's not always easy to get others online to play with you as everyone has different schedules and ect. There's apps and stuff online that you can use to find others to play with as a team. If that's not up your alley though, then just try the best your can.

"02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonHi, I'm here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a player can have: Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little, and it seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Throughout the entire Christmas Event, I kept trying to get some new skins that I liked (Like Hanzos and Soldiers) but in the end, I got ALL the Voicelines, sprays, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes (Except Orisas). No new skins at all.02/20/2018 10:58 AMPosted by beryonit seems like it's not worth it, and you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.Same happened in the Summer Games ;-;","

"02/20/2018 10:08 AMPosted by Akigokubut isnt it the flankers job to kill the supports??More like deal with supports; not be easy kills.Why I prefer the Medic from TF2. His weapon wasn't the strongest, BUT could still punish bad plays on people trying to flank (Mostly Scout)This game, the flanker characters have so many escapes and tools to make the fight THEIRS that it's insane to me to think that any support should have such weak self defense tools.If you engage on a Moira in an enclosed space, you should die.If you engage on an Ana with both cooldowns up, you should die. But that isn't the case in this game. Support characters should feel powerful and impactful; they're the ones who HAVE to hold the team up. The Medic felt that way; while not a huge killing machine, he was both a game changer AND able to defend himself when needed. The Übercharge was the most powerful ability in the game, it defined the competitive meta.Soon as a support is deemed too meta defining, they're nerfed and nerfed.Yeah, some of the nerfs WERE needed (Ana's Grenade, Mercy's res issues) but then are left weaker and unfun until the next Witch Hunt begins.Where's the Witch Hunt for Tracer? She has almost always been the BEST pick for DPS unless of a cheesy strat (Bayblade or Pirate Ship) or another DPS was just buffed too much (Mei's ult charge, 76's 20 damage, McSniper, etc.). She is in almost every single competitive game, and in 79% of OWL. I get it, high skill high reward; except what about Ana? She has arguably a much higher skill floor than Tracer, yet has been the worst support since March 21st of last year.","

"Not having fun playing against this heroe because:A)	His normal attack has too much range and his ball does too much damage.B)	His mines in combination with his ball attack does too much burst damage.C)	His Ult Riptire has too much HP and his Ult in general can be performed with little harm to the player.  Just hide.For point A. I think that he should be good at primarily close quarter damage.  I don’t see the need for him to be able to spam his ball attacks from super far away.  Furthermore, I think the ball attack must make contact with the enemy before doing any type of damage, so no splash damage.  For point B. there is not much you can do if Junkrat got you with one hit, his mines will finish you off.  My suggestion would be to change the effects of his mines from doing damage to doing movement displacement like Pharas knockback rocket. For point C. Not every hero can take out the Riptire on their own, it requires incredible reaction and precision for what this ult can do.  Furthermore, it has very small weaknesses that a good player can remove with proper positioning and movement.  I would suggest reducing the HP of the Riptire and making it so that is slows down after each second time spend running.   Alternatively, the Riptire can be made to follow a straight path like Hanzo’s ult and be detonated at the users request.These are my opinions, I know I am not high ranked and I don’t know everything about this game. I just proving my feedback from my ranks perspective.  It is not fun for me and my friends to play against a player that know how to abuse this hero’s abilities. It takes too much effort to take him out from certain hero’s perspectives.   Thank you for reading and have a nice day.","

"Generally, fighting and losing against enemy isn't fun. Though from what you describe, its more on your tanks needing to switch to D.Va to create space for them to move about and deal with Junkrat or adopting their methods in response to Junkrat.Though on the opposite side, I'm also pretty darn sick of seeing Winston/Zarya and D.Va combo whenever I run Junkrat simply because of how well they can shut a Junkrat down. I can also tell you that I absolutely despise tracer, genji, winston and D.va simply because of how little you can do against that comp.Junkrat has weaknesses, its really up to you and your team to adopt against it. If you want to win(If that's how you have fun.), then either you or your friend has to step up.","

That is not Junkrat's fault however. It's just that he can get a lot more value when people just let him do his thing. Wich at our rank is the case way to often.It's a shame that blizzard doesn't reward people for counter picking, and doesn't punish getting destroyed by one of your counters in some way.

"Edit: Since Symmetra has now been addressed, I have updated the section about QoL adjustments with discussion within the megathread to make it easier for the developer team to read.This is extremely long, but I want to illustrate Symmetras problems and how to fix them, hopefully to enlighten the devs on how to fix her. There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&utm_medium=search&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Overwatch&utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]Discussion consolidated:These are the biggest things that needed to be addressed according to the megathread.Defensive assists for shield gen, as well as the ultimate voiceline ""flashing"" the ultimate location and radius to teammates for 5 seconds.More assists in general for Symmetra, perception of teamplay is just as big of an issue as how much is within her kit. Offensive assists could possibly be added to teleporter (while the visual effect is active on teammates) as well as turrets.Photon barrier is a handicapped supportive utility compared to other support utility that is meant to protect. Most things will spawn past it when you use it (roadhog hooks, flashbang) and you can't really aim it on teammates. Please look at improving it.Her ultimates incentivize her to play alone and practice nesting rather than play with her team, please give her more options for teamplay in the actual kit. Her killing potential is strong, so this should be a minor utility that can compete with healing without being as strong as healing as to not raise her winrate but make her ""feel"" better in a team game. People have suggested everything from an opposite of discord, to decaying shields, to reworking photon barrier so that it can supply decaying shields to teammates with a lower cooldown (either passing through, or activation like orisas ultimate)Teamplay is her biggest issue, by far. Her killing potential is decent for a dps offsupport. Number adjustments may make her too strong at lower tiers where she is considered better balanced.","

"(reserving this post to edit in other suggestions from the community, not the point of this thread, but here to voice any suggestions)FIRST OFF: I want to caution that reworking ideas are not the point behind this thread. More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools.","

"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact.","

"To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs.","
							 (Edited)

"Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect.","

"Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team.","

"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die.","

"Seriously, you guys need to lay off the Symm change ideas.. especially a lot of this complete reworks.  Symm is near perfect the way she is.. it is the community toxicity and the lack of use in the pro scene that holds her back.The pros don’t use her because she take a lot of practice and committment to the hero and lets face it.. the top pros would rather practice on skills that are easily transferable to other heroes, then practice a hero (like mercy who before she became a reworked OP mess— remember she was NU in pro play before her rework) who has a unique playstyle to use at a high level.  She could use some tweeks to help at higher level.. like making her ult silent.. or turret deployment improvements.. but anything else would make her way too dominate at the lower levels.","

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest.","

"https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754867190#post-1I made a post about this in May and trying to bring it back now.Saying sym is a no skill hero is fukin stupid if people dont play her. People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad.","

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :(","

"I feel like for her Photon Barrier, it could get the Orisa treatment, just make it curvier to the sides so it can help block damage.Just curious OP, what do you think of this? Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility.","

Finally, she has a reload time.

So apparently players of my skill level are players with SR 200 or more above me, always on the enemy team. My team are actual similar skill level and often times lower. Yeah sure you could just say ""get gud"" I'd love to but it's really hard to ""get gud"" when these games are so one sided there's no way for me to possibly improve when my team is just rolled over every time. And in the rare case that I get all the high skill level players on my team, there's again no way for me to improve when my team just rolls over the enemy with little to no effort.I don't mind one tricks, I can deal with smurfs, but when I'm losing because the game itself has terrible matchmaking pitting one low to average skill team against a high skill team, it really demotivates me from playing.I used to say ""I don't think I'll ever want to stop playing this game."" I mean heck look at my level I'm level 1294 currently almost at my second gold star. I clearly put a lot of time into this game and loved it. But recently this matchmaking has been getting worse and worse, and I'm finding myself playing this game much less than half the time that I used to. I miss having good and even games, having close games that go into overtime, and awesome team fights. But now it seems that games just last 1-2 minutes because one team just rolls over the other. Or max time because one team can't even push past the first choke. Sorry for this ranty post, you can ignore it, downvote it or whatever, I just needed to vent about this. I'm probably still going to play the game but likely just stick around for just events, and very few times in between. Until matchmaking actually makes fair games, I just can't have fun with this game anymore.","

"Because I'm genuinely getting sick of being backfilled into games that are already on the results screen and not even getting that tiny amount of backfill XP for it.https://i.imgur.com/iKePUfK.jpgI soloq a lot, so the matchmaker seems to prioritize me for backfill. Don't get me wrong, I understand why the matchmaker needs to do this, but so many games, I'll join and instantly be faced with a DEFEAT screen before I've even had a chance to lock in my hero.I understand the very nature of the matchmaker will stop this issue from ever being 100% solved, but here's a few simple changes I propose to reduce the impact and make matchmaking far less stressful:1) Do not allow backfill during overtime, unless it's an ad hoc connection (a player actively choosing to join that specific game from the menu) or the player is already spectating and waiting for a slot. Let's be real, the odds of you being able to change anything in a 5v6 overtime are slim to none, about as high as the odds of you backfilling onto the winning team during that time.2) Give me more than a few hundred extra XP. I don't know what, maybe you could double my base XP during my next game, then maybe I won't get as frustrated when I do end up in these games.3) Put a cooldown between how frequently an individual can be backfilled. The amount of time I spend in queue jumping from endscreen to endscreen because the matchmaker repeatedly backfills me into impossible scenarios is directly impacting the amount of time I'm able to play. It would be nice if whenever I finish a backfill match, there was say, an hour during which time the game would lower or completely eliminate my odds of being backfilled.I'm not asking for a matchmaker overhaul, I'm asking to be able to play the game without getting salty before I've had a chance to play.","

"Mercy 1.0 was fun, but actually only a little less underpowered then she is now.  The reason why: Mercy had no abilities in her base kit that let her actively participate in the fight.  This railroaded Mercy players into basing their entire playstyle around the only active ability Mercy had: her ult, mass rez.Adressing hide n rez: this tactic came down to two sources - SR abusers and people who went waaay out of their way to hide in buildings, rooms below the point, and generally areas that took a while to get to (but was still in range of rez, since it didn't require LoS).  The SR abuse problem has been retroactiely solved with the removal of preformance based SR in diamond and above, and a LoS restriction would force Mercy to put herself out in the open to rez (giving enemies a chance to cc/kill her and eliminating the hide-and-seek minigame).  And one last thing: most Mercy players hated doing hide and rez - it was THEIR TEAMMATES who demanded it, and got toxic if the Mercy didn't.  The standard playstyle of Mercy is to stay with your team as long as possible, only ducking into cover if your team is taking more damage than you can heal/if you see an ult wipe incoming.I don't want to go back to a version of Mercy that doesn't have the GA bunnyhop, but I also hate rez on E with a passion and don't even consider Valkyrie to be an ultimate.  The best solution (to me) seems to be putting a balanced version of Mass Rez on Q, and figuring out an E ability that incentivises Mercy to stay with her team and use it to directly participate in the fight.","

Hide-and-go-Res wasn't LoS abuse.  Far, far from it.  It was where unskilled Mercy players would basically only play with their teams until they got ult, then they would hide away in some corner of the map far away from the teamfight.  They would probably instruct their team to all die on point, then wait for everyone to die before swooping in virtually uncontested for a huge res.  They did this to boost themselves into high ranks, because Performace SR rewarded players who performed more huge reses.I'm well aware of the predominant Mercy strategy to hide when enemy ults come.  The best Mercies I played with Tempo-resed all of the time.  But that doesn't change that poor Mercies were abusing SR gain from huge res by hiding regardless of the situation.And no, it wasn't retroactively solved by only removing performance-based SR in the highest ranks.  It will need to be removed across all ranks for Hide-and-Res to become less of an issue.  Want to know why?

"OH i enjoyed Mass Rez, except when the enemy teams' mercy popped out of nowhere on a Team kill and screamed her infamous lines in German, for resurrecting the whole team on the Payload and having them finish the fight. It did make mercy the wildcard in the game, because if you didn't kill mercy or find her in time, she re-started the fight. I look at this from both aspects: Positive and negative. I think the fight dynamics were most interesting before the single target rez and Valkyrie.Valkyrie though, has opened up a box of snakes. It encourages battle mercy. The community HATES this, but battle mercy IS fun this way. I just hit Valkyrie, yes the team is spamming I am ""Prick thrower"" for not healing. but I just mowed down the entire enemy team with a pistol. As for Widow VS Valkyrie mercy, its gg for widow. Even with well-placed headshots, mercy is still going strong. Valkyrie allows for Revenge kills with mercy, she can fly around anywhere and go after the player she has a grudge against.","

I only hope Blizzard would actually succeed and fix it.And this is coming from a big fan of new heroes. While new heroes do affect the rest of the game like change the meta, the broken/bad stuff we currently have is ruining the fun.A few things I can remember right now is when you disconnect 1 second before the match ends, even if you win you will receive a defeat and -50 SR. If the server dies and you get kicked, defeat and -50 SR. Disconnect, come back 10 seconds after and win the match? Defeat and -50 SR.  It takes months and months to make a simple change to a hero. Took 2 years to fix a Mei bug. Competitive is a mess, it's random, a lot of the times you can't play what you want unless you disregard what the team needs, and lots of people who play Competitive completely disregarding what the team needs.It's not fun when 95% of effort gets put into new content and 5% into existing content.","

"For one, even a decent Widowmaker requires a lot of mechanical skill, which is rather noteworthy. Someone who can track well with a sniper is most likely going to be a major asset to the team and cripple the enemy when played right.Also, Widowmaker has a lot of weaknesses in close quarters, hence her need to stay away from the brunt of the fight. I get that it sucks to be one-shot (a legitimate one-shot, not just multiple damage sources in short time-frame), but there are strengths and weaknesses to each character. Do remember that she is a Defense hero: she specializes in zoning areas. Having the possibility of being one-shot or losing a major amount of health is usually enough to encourage shields, strafing, or just outright avoiding the area.You gotta choose your battles.","

"The best course of action is to be mindful of the info you're given. Once the match starts you can check to see who's on the opposing team, and there will be audio queues from your character and/teammates letting you know there's a sniper. If you do get killed, watch the kill cam. It'll let you know where they're hiding, and you can plan accordingly.","

"Stream Sniping:  It's an intentional act to try to queue and get placed in the same game/match as the Streamer with the intention of ruining the Streamer's game/stream.  For example, Timthetatman was targeted by that stream sniper who would either get on his team, and throw.  Or be on the enemy team and would target Timthetatman over everyone else.

Not to mention another ape-based hero would be SOOOO underwhelming. I can hear the giant sigh of disappointment in the player base already. Every character that has been introduced is always different than the last. I expect the trend to continue.","

02/20/2018 11:04 AMPosted by Meowcenaryhttps://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Jetpack_CatLikely never gonna happen tho unfortunately. The idea was scrappedSuch a missed opportunity if they dont make it so. The reasons Jeff gave just dont sell it to me. He said the idea of a flying cat was too outlandish even for Overwatch but we have a talking scientist gorilla...he also said they ran into trouble designing the paws to work with the jetpack controls but I feel D Va's in-mech view is exactly this. So...why the difficulty? He said it was a scrapped idea but I would not be surprised if it was a hint of things to come. I just dont see it not being feasible and another animal hero would be a pretty bad !@# addition to the roster.,"

"Ok I was thinking a while back: What if jetpack cat was in the game. How would you make a cat with a jetpack a fighter? This is my take on it:Name: JetCat (because jetpack cat may be to long for the character select screen)Class: DefensePrimary Fire: 50 Damage ScratchSecondary Fire: Opens Up a Scope, Shots do 90 Damage a hit. Scope has a laser sight showing where the shots will go. Special frequency of light that only cat eyes can see.Ability 1:Tangle: Places A hairball on the ground in front of them. Anyone who walks through them will be slowed to 50% speed and mobility abilities are reduced by 50%. Can have 5 out at a time, must wait 5 seconds before placing another one. Does not stack with other hairball.Second Ability: Prowl: Jetpack Cat Becomes invisible all except for its eyes, similiar to a cat in the dark, for 5 seconds. Can shoot while invisible. 8 Second cooldown.Ultimate: Flight: JetCat's jetpack flies off and can either attach to an ally, who then gains control and can use it however, or can attach to an enemy and carry cool down.Thoughts?","

"Coming up with ideas of how it would work is the easy part. He/she could be a flying character similar to Pharah but without as much up-time (somewhere in between DVa's boosters and Pharah's hover). Maybe a hit-scan flyer but with slow mobility while airborne but when on the ground much faster however a different weapon, ability is used.","

"D.Va's accuracy is really not that important. For lots of heroes it isn't since there are a ton of factors that can inflate/deflate it. My D.Va accuracy probably hovers around 20%. She has lots of spread and a lot of her time shooting is spent just poking at enemies, so you cannot expect it to be too high. As for tips, try to find a nice medium between offensive and defensive with her. Only peel off for enemies who are all alone and you know you can get without your mech being destroyed. By and large you want to stay with your team. D.Va is not indestructable and her biggest weakness is how easy it is to melt her mech, so you must work around this weakness. D.Va's mobility and tankiness isn't to charge into the enemy team and try to assassinate an enemy while their entire team is around. You have to punish out of position enemies and go pick off the flankers. Having a high sensitivity isn't important and you need to find the sens you are most comfortable with. Sensitivity is all about preference so if you're having a hard time tracking enemies, I'd consider lowering it! Mine on console is just 65/65 and I find it works great for me tbh.","

I try to emulate the Dvas who get kills by launching it into the air but can never seem to get anyone with them unless they are stunned by other ults.For the bombs I would suggest working on sliding the bombs off of walls/objects. Those will be the sneakiest bombs since they get caught on the wall for a second until they slide out into the open and explode. Shooting the bomb off into the air at an angle also works well for me. I have little luck shooting it straight up into the air (it's just so predictable and differing sky boxes means where the bomb ends up detonating isn't consistent since it may hit the sky box or may not) and I would suggest you never ult to salvage your mech except for in the rare cases you /know/ your team can still win the fight and having you will help. Your best bet is to go into custom games and check out the best walls to slide your bomb off of (watch out because it can get stuck on some!)","

					",,,,,,,
One of D.Va's biggest asset is her mobility. Jump in and out of fights and punish when you see opportunities. When your team is pushing use her to create space. When you're under fire always try to show your back to minimize damage. Mastering this will make your DVa a lot more durable. Mix that with your DM too ofc.Always focus on the high priority targets or the ones that D.Va easily kills in a single rush missile combo.,"

"Tips for Dva, her DM should be saved for eating orbs and enemy ults.  You really shouldn't be using it to ""tank"".  Its more of gobble ults and occasionally protect allies out of position or allies pulled by hog.  You can also use DM when you are diving in on the enemy.  Dva is meant to be played aggressively, when you see an opportunity to dive on an enemy support do so.  Dive at them rocket in their face while shooting them and then melee.  They are typically dead with this combo.","

"This would cause more problems than it solves. People would click the category with the shortest wait time then play what they want anyways (invalidating the entire system). If you force them to play the role they select then DPS would have insane wait times. You'd also open the doors for throwers to pick support and just troll DPS players who waited ten minutes for a match (And giving a fast-lane for griefers). You'd also run into the issue of DPS players unable to hit Pharah due to no experience on Hitscan. But if you have supports who can, the system wont let them swap mid game. That is of course you allow a system to bypass the initial system... which then defeats the purpose of the role select system from the get go.","

I solo que.Not to mention I CAN play other heroes and so could most people on my team. Being a one trick is playing one sole HERO not one sole role. It's just that we all had all of OUR hours on support except for me and the tank guy. Also I'm a tank AND support main. -_-I just call myself a support main because people call me that even though I play more hours on tank than I want to.And last I checked you don't have to be great at every hero in the game. There are a ton of players that climbed with only 3 to 4 heroes (I can play 7 hereos comfortably). Plus I dont like being dps, I like having large health pools and being able to heal myself before anyone else.  I could go into detail on why I don't like playing most dps heroes in Overwatch but it's really just down to none of them have a playstyle that I've liked so far. Oh I can play dps. I'm just not consistent. Sometimes I do really well and other times I'm just there to feed the enemy. Not to mention in every game people instalock dps. And I only play comp. If I were to play dps in comp people would report me for throwing because they see my hours aren't on dps. I can't play quick play because it's boring to me. I guess I could Smurf and instalock dps on a second account, otherwise it really wouldn't be wise for me to practice in comp. Plus don't forget the fact that I would be hella bored playing characters I don't want to play. I didn't have this problem playing Paladins. At least in that game there were about 3 champions in every role that I liked and was really good at. Tyra, Viktor, Lian...Ruckus, Fernando, Torvald...Seris, Ying, Jenos...Can't wait for a ""then go back to Paladins"" comment.I don't know why I'm so different in Overwatch. I guess no matter how similar the characters seemed on paper, in actuality they play very differently.","

At least when a genji or tracer steals my kills they have to be somewhat aware of the situation unfolding and have the cognitive ability to either aim their cursor or press swift strike and most importantly of all the person they are killing is actually on their screen. Moira on the other hand doesn't even need to be at their keyboard and that isn't an exaggeration. You can fire the orb in a random direction,get up and go get a drink and come back to multiple kills.","

"One, five-stacks become impossible.Two, this leads to extremely long queue times and higher chances of imbalanced matches for anyone not solo queueing. In fact, as of now, there's quite a few people who regularly play in groups that think there's a bias against them, which is that the matchmaker will assume groups are stronger, and find more skilled solo-queue opponents to make up for the assumed difference if it can't find a more equally sized and skilled group.And this is longer queue times for everyone, mind you, regardless if it's solo queue or not.Unless a whole new competitive system is introduced (hi, guild system?), this just can't feasibly happen for every single match. Solo queuers are the easiest to get into games and fill into matches, removing them and putting them into their own queue just can't work without ruining the experience of the other half. Right now, you just have to enter the games knowing you're always at the risk of being placed into or against stacked teams -- but the matchmaker considers that already, so, you know, this just feels like one more excuse to say ""the game made me lose, change the game for me."" No offense.","

"Agree / Signed.1. Solo (1/1/1/1/1/1)2. Mix It Up (2/2/2 or 4/2 or 3/3)3. Full (6)No 5/1 unless you check ""will fill"" which would allow any of the current combos. If you are in a duo and check ""allow fill"" you can be teamed with solos. Otherwise, you're with other small groups.The ""versus"" would have a different metric, similar to what it is now. Solos won't go against 6-stacks, but might go up against Mixed Stacks. You don't get to choose your opponents.This, along with an ""avoid joining team with this player"" will affect your queue time. That's OK if that's what you want.For 6 stacks, allow an alternate player in the case of disconnects. This player must be in the group (which means that groups can actually be larger than 6) and the team sorts out who is in the game during the load time. If you don't choose in time, it's random. The 7th player spectates. He can't be ""tagged in"" though... if someone leaves, they can't come back, and they get the leaving penalty. This could only be done for groups though. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't sign up for a fill unless I really trusted my team. And if you allow a troll on your team who comes in and throws, that's on you, and only affects people who willingly grouped up together.","

"What has been one or some of your funniest moments in Overwatch so far, whether it be in Training, Skirmish, Competitive, Quick Play, or Custom? One funny moment I had, I think I was 76. We were attacking in Hollywood, and the defending team was spawn-killing us and the match was 3/4 over and we were losing. Somehow I managed to dash past everybody by going through the building on the left outside the attack spawn point (ran down the stairs, through the archway past their Reinhardt, and went behind the building next to the point), and was literally just crouching behind the car on the point the whole time, captured about 90% before they figured out someone was on point and they all came after me and killed me. That was amusing. We did win in the end, because of that. ;)Another funny moment was during the Army of One brawl, in Skirmish.

Instead I landed in this little crevice in the rocks. I couldn’t get back up without someone to fly to with Guardian Angel. I couldn’t climb or jump over the rocks to fall, die and respawn. So I’m in this stupid friggin’ grotto on Illios, and all I hear from my team is “I NEED HEALING!”So (having no mic) I start spamming the text chat.  “Help! I’m stuck down a hole! I can’t get out!”  And I take Mercy’s pistol and start shooting into the sky, in bursts of three, the universal signal for “I’m in the sh*t” in gun language, hoping to lead one of my teammates to me.So I hear footsteps above me, and soon friendly Widowmaker falls past me and dies, bless her heart for trying. Another minute goes by and I hear Sombra’s “Hello!”  And I finally look up, and there’s my friendly Sombra looking over the edge down at me, waving hello.So I was finally able to use her to GA out of the hole, and she and I both died about 2 seconds later by enemy Roadhog.

I think they were just as shocked as me that no death blossom was forethcoming as we all know what it means when you see a Reaper jump down behind your team. I couldn't figure out what happened until I saw my Ultimate guage with the number 98%.Time slowed down and we must have stared for at least a few seconds. Then we remembered that we were playing Overwatch and on different teams.

It will be like Reddit and how they can control things. So basically if you get down voted a ton of times your going to have a higher restriction on how many times you post and what your post are allowdd to have.Posted a few times on a subreddit for hunters x hunter and the reddittors downvoted it to hell(I forget what post I was probably oblivious to information) I have a 10 minute restriction for post.

"I truly and honestly believe Blizzard is getting their act together. They revamped the report system., They made the rules clear, they've made a point out of 2 popular streams for false reporting one tricks, and Jeff himself has said on the forums that throwing is reportable and one tricking is not, and that reporting one tricks is bannable.While there's definitely room for this implementation of silenced users not being able to post on the forums to be dangerous, account silences are never permanent the first time. So if it happens once you will most definitely get to speak up when the chat ban runs out. if it happens again, well.... Idk man I can only say it's most likely your own fault.And there's always blizzard customer support (like actually contacting them instead of just responding with a ticket)","

I'm glad Blizzard has the pro games. It makes it easier to spot the cheaters. I'm just supposed to believe that 1 out ever 100 players just happens to be better than any pro I've ever seen. And they all happen to play quick play instead of competitive? (only saw one super absurd aim player in comp). Blizzard needs to do a better job of finding and banning these players. It's not enjoyable to both play against and with these people.,"

"(WARNING: LONG RANT) So I’m having a nice game in Junkertown on Quickplay right? Minding my own business as Tracer, and our team is really dominating. Like we managed to push it from the beginning to the second point without being stopped. So in my head I’m thinking, “Yes! I might actually get a bunch of free XP!” since it’s really hard to get when solo queuing like I’m left to do 99% of the time I play Overwatch. Then suddenly I see a Reinstancing sign at the top of the screen because 3 enemy teammates left. And just like that I’m kicked from the match I was in. WHY? Just because my team was winning and some salty players left? I get it, they left and gave the enemy team a disadvantage. But that’s why you’re already forcing people to be backfills for games like these. So why, why do I and the rest of my teammates have to get cheated out for our hard work? It’s just so frustrating to have to lose XP like that, especially when it means I’m closer to another Lunar Event Loot Box. Sorry for the long rant.","

"Honestly there's probably some fun psychology behind what types of personalities gravitate towards particular hero types.But in general, I'd imagine tanks really want team play, so they're people who often want to succeed and enjoy multiplayer games the most.By contrast, and I'm not !@#$ting on DPS, a lot of FPS games do not require any teamwork and you can just lone-ranger your way through it. Some people just want all the kills, all the damage, and don't want to protect healers, tanks, divers.

Absolutely. I play Zenyatta a lot. I rely mostly on tanks for survivability in the game. Especially barrier tanks since I usually got no means of escaping. I've had Zarya's saving me from getting pinned by Reinhardt also hog not getting that shot after hooks.  Sometimes I've had hogs hooking enemy Mccrees after using their flashbang on me or even completely shielding me while taking a breather (thanks to this 50% damage reduction buff). These kinds of players truly understand the awareness of the games. Also being a big hitbox hero also makes you vulnerable.,"

Not to mention a lot of ""healer mains"" are not healers by choice, but because nobody wants to take the role.DPS mains... well, are Dps mains, If they are under-performing or just being countered, they start pointing fingers at each other for not healing or not doing whatever rather than picking another hero or try a different approach. Tanks on the other hand, are somewhat dependent on their team, but can still carry regardless of what the rest of their team are doing. they have the mentality of a support, they know they require their team to be of any use, but are still capable of getting kills themselves, and so, they don't get as frustrated as other players.

"It's because tanks get the least amount of crap from their teammates. Most of the player base has no idea what they do and they aren't willing to do it better so you get less flame for playing tank. Playing on a tank only account VS my main where I play DPS, I get a crazy amount of flame playing DPS. Even if I'm playing poorly on tank, no one will say anything or blame DPS/support.If you consistently treat someone badly, they will act badly. This is why Hanzo mains have the stereotype of being sour, they get flamed on the daily.","

because alot of people who lack aiming skill are playing supports like mercy and moira and if ana becomes balanced (not op or anything just balanced) they would be wrekt therefore blizzard keeps ana underpowered and mercy and moira overpowered.,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"Ana's value is about staying aliveAs the only support without a clear way to stay alive (Healing passive, high damage, or high mobility) she struggles in that sense.Ana's BEST tool is her Grenade; it is also her ONLY tool to heal herself. If you take a stray rocket or explosion for 120 damage, you use your grenade to heal. Yet it leaves you STILL under full health meaning you need to leave the fight for a health pack OR take focus from your other support.Ana is a character that thrives in slower, closer games BUT with how the game has been mobility creeped (Doomfist, Sombra, Moira, Mercy, Widowmaker, Junkrat, new Hanzo*tm*) and how much faster the game is played, Ana doesn't really have a leg to stand on anymore.She has ONE tool that has a 0.5 second delay before it is shot off to defend herself. It has a 12 second cooldown. Every single movement ability has a lower cooldown than that.Ana's ONLY self healing has a 10 second cooldown. Every support has one that is faster and more consistent that CAN'T be blocked. Even Moira, if she can't life steal has her biotic orb that has the same cooldown BUT heals for MORE (Not to mention fade)Ana needs at LEAST a form of healing passive at this point. Buffing her Sleep Dart or BioGrenade are VERY dangerous; they have the potential to be VERY overbearing if they're not kept in check with their restrictions.","
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"It's dumb. You have heroes like Widow, Soldier, McCree who become really powerful if you have the aim. A skilled Ana should absolutely be outperforming other supports.  Moira is at the power level a practised Ana should be at. Moira should be a robust anti-flanker healer who sacrifices output. The balance decisions in this game drive me wild.","

"She has the tools to be the most powerful healer (sleep dart is obviously good if you have the aim for it, and her nade is criminally underrated) what she currently lacks are the passives to take her that step further. She needs a better way to get health back other than wasting her nade on herself, and it's ridiculous that a sniper-healer is best rewarded for basically sticking her rifle up her tanks behinds - she needs to be able to get to better vantage spots faster than walking around up stairs forever. Other than that the current meta just doesn't favor her. Winston is brutal on her with both his attack and his shield, and Tracer annihilates Ana within seconds unless she gets a lucky sleep on her. If we get a tank-heavier meta that relies more on death-ball you will see her more.","

You're trying to tell me she doesn't ?Not at close range. Not at shieldbreak or mobility or self-sustain. She can kill people faster and from farther away, which is huge, but she crumples pretty fast in a brawl and can be pretty hard countered.[Ed: My point, in case it isn't clear, is that even if Ana is buffed (and I think she probably should be), she will always have some drawbacks compared to the ""easier"" supports as a tradeoff for her hugely valuable utility]","

"Low survivability causes heroes to hide before ulting. Why does Reaper hide before ulting? Well, ironically, he can't use shadow step in a fight and not expect to die. Same for Mercy, if Guardian Angel was reliable enough, which it isn't, she hid as an unhealthy exploit, and used res as her ""hehe sorry but I'm back"" button.Same reason McCree is encouraged to hide before using his slow-movement ult? Same reason Pharah has to sneak in Barrage.I GENUINELY don't understand whats confusing.","

"What you fail to understand, is that NOT having a support present, to heal people was the reason for people dying. Back when mercy had mas res, you had 2 options.Either you picked ana or a mercy.If you had ana, she could have kept your team alive, be a part of it and contribute.For mercy, She would hide somewhere. Not heal anyone during that time. Cause everyone to die only for the possibility of mas res which most of the time, was immediately shut down by higher level players. Which is why mercy never saw even the slightest bit of usefulness for grandmaster lvl and above. At least now she's more engaging. She contributes during fights and she doesn't hide somewhere and is actually more viable than before.","

"Yeah, I LOVE the generalization that many, not all, of the DPS mains put out about Mercy. The BAD Mercy players played ""Hide and Rez"", the GOOD ones didn't. Not ALL of the videos on YouTube show Mercy doing Hide and Rez do they?No, they do not. Yet that is what we are ALWAYS accused of. But the Original Post DOES have a point! 1) Reaper, McCree, and often Soldier 76 and Junkrat would hide then pull their Ult to maximize damage to the enemy team.2) Hanzo just shoots through walls with HIS Ult, basically hiding but not quite.3) Tracer can ZIP in, drop her mine, then ZIP back out quickly.4) D.Va can turbo her Meka in for her Ult.I could go on, but you get the general idea. Yet Mercy, due to a few bad players, had her Ult removed and replaced, then nerfed into the ground.Just saying that if any DPS hero had been treated THIS harshly, do to a few rotten apples in the bunch, the game would have already folded up tent and no one would be playing anymore. Yet do this to a Healer, and YEAH we can still kill stuff and play...Ready for the down-votes...","

That is just the way Death Blossom and Shadow Step are designed. Even if Reaper had good mobility (which he doesn't have), you would still hide if you want to pull off a successful Death Blossom.","

I would imagine having 0 hours played as her you wouldn't know how she was used. I had a quintuple rez as Mercy once, defending point A of Temple of Anubis. I heard about two or three Ultimate callouts from the enemy team, so I knew there were going to be a few deaths whether I was trying to heal them or not. So I did the smart thing and hid on the other side of the arch. Sure enough, a couple more enemy Ultimates were sent in and they wiped all five of my teammates, and again, it would not have made a difference if I had been trying to heal them, I just would have died as well.So I waited for all that mess to clear up, swooped in and got the easy 5-rez. We hard held point A because they had burned every single Ultimate they had. It was extra sweet because the team had asked me to swap off Mercy at the start of the round. Boy did they feel stupid.","

Especially given the utter lack of counterplay of 1.0.Lets see, counter-plays to Mercy 1.0 HUmmmmmm? This was BEFORE she was given temporary invulnerability because more than half the time she would die pulling Rez in the first place.1) as always KILL the Mercy by:...A) in the ult ...B) before you pull ult...C) while she is flying in (Widowmaker/Hanzo mains)2) AFTER she pulls her Ult by:... Saving 1 ult to take care of a recently Rezed team. BUT, this took coordination an with one person pulling their Ult, and the other DPS not wanting to be outdone, the other DPS/Tanks would pull their Ults doing all that Showboating.... ummm.. I mean ""Hard work"" to get the POG.You blow 3-5 Ults at the same time, not saving any Ults JUST IN CASE of a Rez, then it is YOUR OWN DANG FAULT and your team should be punished for it.I had this one game, running back from spawn for about the 5th time because my DPS couldn't be bothered to take out the flankers that were targeting me. I come back to where they all are, after 3 people on the enemy team had pulled there Ults at the same time to take out my team. I fly in to the middle of them and pull an absolutely PERFECT 5 man Rez, it was BEAUTIFUL!!! Anyway, everyone knows how small a Tracer bomb is right? This one VERY smart Tracer threw her bomb into the middle of us and my 5 man Rez turned into a 6 man wipe. QUITE DESERVINGLY, the Tracer got PoG. So don't you DARE say there were ""No Counters to Mercy Rez"" because there sure were before, during, AND AFTER.","

I did not say Hiding from your Ult, because getting clear or being clear of it is not hiding. Now you, and other HEAVY killing Ults have one less defense against them. An, quite honestly, many of Mercy 1.0 Rezes were Tempo Rezes of 1 to 3 Heroes, not Huge Rezes of 4-5 Heroes.

"I don't think he's bad but he's such a niche dps compared to the others. Even as a tank buster Bastion is usually just a better pick cause he shreds them faster, can do it from a distance and can break shields. His abilities are also kinda lack luster. Teleport is way to slow, leaves him vulnerable for 2 seconds (also kinda buggy sometimes) and is very map dependent to get value out of, wraith form is okay but kinda one note and easy to play around.Again I don't think he's bad but he could stand to see a little love, maybe make wraith form a bit faster, let him teleport whilst in wraith form, re-work teleport into something a bit more practical.","

Only that people attempted to use it to do that.I avoided a player the day the Overwatch servers went live. In the two months before it was removed I played games against the player I avoided maybe a dozen or so times. I would chat in ALL chat with them before the match started. The person I was playing against did not know I placed them on Avoid Player, and I did so because of game philosophy disagreement, I play to win this person did not. I know each and every time I was against them it was the same person I avoided, and I confirmed that they were still on my list to make sure I had not removed them.The avoid player feature was removed because Blizzard figured out before it was too late, that some players were becoming so bothersome other people did not want to play with them. Eventually these individuals would not find a game in a timely manner. Blizzard admitted that the system was working as intended. I am guessing they just didn't know how well it would intend on working, or how fast it would remove the unwanted from the player pools.","

And tbh, with this restriction why should anyone avoid some awesome player from being on your team at all?2.1) Set the avoid player function on a list of ~30-50 player.This way you can't just avoid anyone for eternity because if there is someone else you want to avoid and your list is full, well then you just remove someone from your list you haven't seen for ages.OR2.2) Set the avoid player list unlimited but remove players automatically after a while (72hrs/1week/1month/1season ) this way you will be able to avoid certain players for a while but they will be ""unavoided"" after the time frame you put them on your list is gone.","

In 13 years playing Blizzard games, and the same amount of time following topics on the forums as well as Blizzard design philosophy. Blizzard has never made a change in any game ever based on the experience of one player. Blizzard has always made decisions based upon how inclusive a change can be. ""Avoid Player"" was an exclusionary option. It allowed you to not have to play with people you did not want to play with. This pretty much goes against everything I have ever seen Blizzard do.I will still defend my opinion. ""Avoid Player"", even with a minor glitch of increasing the queue time of some people unintentionally, was working exactly like it should have. The only people who do not want an Avoid feature are people who would be avoided, and probably are in every facet not just Overwatch.","

I have used controllers before so not super alien to me but for some reason no matter what settings I do on Overwatch the controller just feels bad. I feel like the controller has ""mouse acceleration"" It sometimes moves slow then sometimes moves too fast, and motion blur that can't be disabled makes it even harder. Does anyone know the best optimal settings for Overwatch on PS4 or is it just something I gotta get use too? (Also if there is a way to disable motion blur?

Maybe the motion blur is caused by your tv/monitor? I don't know much about that, so maybe try tweaking the tv's picture settings.","

"Which one do you use most often? Left click:Pros:Better dps at 0.4 sec between shots (2.5 shots per second)You can spam chokes and the battle field to contribute to team damageCons:You stay in line of sightLow burst damage (so you might not get kills)Right click:Pros:You can tuck behind a corner and stay safeBurst damage potential to one shot people and don't allow them to get awayCons:Worse dps at 0.6 sec for each charge (1.666 shots per second)Lower spam potentialBut here's the question: I have been using primarily the left click because of higher DPS. Basically, unless I am being chased or I have a particular target that I want to burst down, I use left click. Typically, I stand a safe distance away discord, harmony and just spam the battle field with left-click, at the head level (okay, I try to predictive but it is hard and I don't think I have the exact mechanical or timing skills for mastery).But I am wondering if this is the best way to do it. So my question is, assume, you are playing Zen at a safe distance and nobody is jumping on you and there is a fight going on in front of you. Do you use left clicks or right clicks?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"left click in the fight. right click for shooting at span, a genji jumping over you, a tracer, anything where you think you can burst someone. some pros have compared right click to scatter(i dont think) but right click is def more powerful than left click, its just left is more consistnt so you have to use it more","

"IMO it depends on how important transcendence is.  If the enemy is running grav-dragon or some other wipe combo, I usually prefer left-clicking their tanks in the fight to build ult faster.  If trance isn't that important, I'm more likely to go for r-click snipes.","

"Interesting opinions. The trans angle is definitely a good point. Left click has higher DPS potential and it is easier to charge up using tanks but even if I have trans, I prominently used to use left clicks. But is the sniping potential of right click that makes it better or the safety offered by being able to charge behind cover? Assume there are no snipers, otherwise, I agree charge shots are definitely better.","

"Left-click for fighting mobile targets.  Also, it's faster to stop shooting to assign Healing and Discord Orbs.Right-click for corner-peek shots, spamming corridors, smashing high HP targets.  Fully charged Right-click corner-peek shots are also good for destroying Torbjorn turrets which can generally shoot Zenyatta down faster than he can destroy it.  But avoid charging shots all the time as Zenyatta is locked in his animation and can't assign his orbs while doing so.","

If you can't kill Moira and she kills you over the course of four seconds, yes, you got outplayed.For reference, Tracer at maximum range can potentially unload 240 damage into a Moira, making the self-heal worthless. While I admit you need near perfect aim to do this, it's not unrealistic given Tracer can negate most of Moira's damage by using 'E', thus potentially prolonging the fight to 10 seconds, giving a much larger margin of error for Tracer's aim.","

More damage, though? That's not true at all. Zenyatta and Symmetra outdamage her by about a mile and a half, and even Mercy can do better damage than her if you can land headshots. And she's no tank, either. She's just as susceptible to burst damage as the other supports are.

She’s best against weak but sustained damage(Sombra, Soldier) but helpless against burst. Can’t outheal a Tracer’s clip to the head, since her pistols fire so fast. Also, all tanks have armor(not Roadhog, but he gets about half his health back when he uses TaB, so there’s that) and Moira doesn’t. I also forgot when exactly they gave her a large tank-sized health pool. She has the best consistent damage, but not the best overall. Zen and Sym melt poorly coordinated teams like butter in an oven, and Mercy’s pistol does more if you can consistently land headshots.","

The lowest dps in the game. If she has her damage orb on a target long enough, she can do 100 dps. Which only puts her above Ana in the support dps department. She then matches Mercy. However, the balancing point then comes between Moira’s soft-lock beam which can’t crit but is consistent and Mercy’s ability to crit which takes more aim. Lucio and Zenyatta our dps Moira. I will say if Moira is flanking to play dps and take out low health heroes - the other team must be makjng some really poor choices.","

"Below are some ideas that the community or myself have requested to the devs, but have never been added to the game. The following changes are sensible and well thought out, be sure to comment your opinions and suggestions as I will be updating this a lot.ChangesSombra Translocator Cancel; Ever been waiting around ages or have to use the teleporter when you could just simply hold E (or another key) to cancel it?In-game Alerts; Picture this, every time you get yourself caught in junkrat's trap, the enemy team gets notified that someone has been trapped- rather than only the junkrat being notified. This makes it so you don't have to shout it out on voice chat, and allows players who don't use voice chat or text to communicate what is happening. This doesn't just stop here; as you can be notified say if- Torb's turret was destroyed. I know that most characters have voice lines which say that something has happend; but for the competitive side it's much more convinent for the average player. This change will allow players to be more cooperative and work as a team to perform combos.Symmetra Shield Health GUI; In a recent patch Winston was given the ability to view his shield's health with a small GUI. This is a nice touch and suits the game as other characters like Reinhardt can view their shield's health. So why is Symmetra left out on this?! OK, sure- maybe it's not as important as Winston's, but it really isn't anything too hard to do and can help in some situations.Heal/Damage Numbers; This could be a toggle on/off option which allows you to show how much healing/damage you are doing. This may be useful for people who want to test stats or change settings in a Custom Game.Extended Sombra Invisiblity; If you read the title, you probably already understand my message im giving you- why does she only get a limited amount of time? You go to chase someone and.. it runs out? Or you become visible when you didn't want to? She's a stealth Hero! Not a visible Hero!More Custom Game Options; And you wonder why no one chooses the Custom Browser which you put on the main page of the gamemodes, if there isn't any settings to change within the game- then its just boring. Sure you added some settings like no gravity, but us creative players we want more options or we can't create that perfect huge roadhog boss battle that we all wanted to make!Clans; Wouldn't it be cool if we could all create a clan, lets say if you have a lot of expirence with the game you can! So like once you reach level 50 or so, or maybe a star (level 101) you can create a clan with a custom profile picture and start adding your friends to it. Sort of like a very minature village.Torbjorn's Hitbox; Nuff said.Detailed Scoreboard; Right now people just say ""4 gold m9 lol im doing GREAT im so pro"", but imagine if you could give players detailed information on how awful they are playing. (im just joking this will lead to more toxic behaviour but it would be cool to view more detailed stats).Changeable Weapons and Skins; Look ok, we all know we want Widow's Cote D'azur skin but at the same time having her Nova Skin's Gun.Updated Hero Information Screen; This hasn't change since the game launched for the old heroes, so this means that new players who follow the video instructions learning how to play Symmetra will try and give people shields by using the E key (second ability).New Training Zone; We all know it hasn't changed since.. well.. the game launched- at all. Look i'm sure Symmetra can use hard light to craft a new Training Zone.Higher Skill Cap To Play Competitive; Tired of getting matched with a guy that only knows how to place a turret as Torbjorn?","

I don't think Sombra needs extended invisibility but tanslocator cancel would be great. Sometime I throw trans to a bad spot it takes forever to get it back,"
						Feb 17
					",,,,,,,
"The Translocator cancel isn't relevant unless you always put it on a health pack and expect to teleport back to it. Just save your Translocator for when you need it and then throw it, so you can stay in the vicinity of the fight, and don't have to run back and forth while abandoning your team.This is basically the same thing as the Translocator example. You're just using it without considering what you want to use it for.  Set yourself a goal, such as you have to use Stealth to flank around and kill the healer, or you have to use it to chase down Genji trying to go for a health pack. Using Stealth this way means that time won't be a problem at all, because you won't be running aimlessly all over the map.It seems to me like Blizzard is adding new options to custom games with every other update. I really don't see why this is a complaint other then players being impatient.Yes, a guild system is the most requested change in the game. I don't see how anyone can disagree with this.There needs to be a disadvantage to always running around in crouch. A taller target is always going to be easier to hit then a smaller one. Torbjorn can practically hide behind is turret.I don't see this ever happening. The weapon skins are a part of the skins as a whole. The ability to change color scheme on your weapon skin would be more realistic.I don't think a training zone is a big priority for Blizzard, even though it would be nice to have for the hardcore wannabe pros, so they can spend hours shooting dots.Blizzard are improving on the grouping system all the time, they have said this often. It will never be perfect.","

She feels like a Generalist in a Specialists body. She has a lot of different abilities and they don't feel like they line up together with each other. She's a support but really only supports by using her shield SOMETIMES and using her ultimate. (Which in my book isn't enough. You could make Widowmaker a Support for the same reasons. Venom Mine reveals a target that's affected and her ultimate reveals all targets.)She's called a defensive hero because she has the DPS for it AND she has defensive capabilities.I know you said the roles were ""guidelines"" but I truly wanna know what direction you aim to take Symmetra in.","

She is a jack if all trades, and that's not a bad thing.Sym can fill in the gaps in poor team comps e.g. Low of tanks? Sym can block damage and create space. Low on healing?

"I agree with ShinyPants, she actually has a lot of utility, it's a shame that people don't realize that. I play symmetra quite a bit, and I'd say she is actually a viable pick in many cases, both on attack and defense. She is a high risk though, when played good she can delete whole teams and carry the game, but also when properly countered she can be completely useless.The biggest problem with symmetra is that people don't know what to do with her and how to use her. She has a very odd design, unlike any FPS character, and in the meantime has developed a reputation of being somewhat of a troll pick. I get regularly harassed for playing her in comp before we even leave the spawn room. It's a shame, I really find her fun to play, precisely because she's not you typical CoD character. It was this fact, that OW is not like every other shooter out there, that has drawn me to it in the first place.","

"The game is balanced and designed for PC more than console, as well as receiving updates at the same time or faster as console, in addition to having the PTR.Also, from what I know at the high ranks on console most players use a mouse and keyboard instead of a controller with a special adapter, which gives them an unfair advantage on console while being standard on PC.So I'd recommend moving to PC if you can make the transition (like DSP Stanky did) but if console is your thing where all your friends are you should probably stay there.","

"Usually, the tactic is simple. When looking for a first pick to snowball from, the healer is your best target. The first team to kill the opposing healer has the greatest advantage for the team fight. Moira, however, is a new beast in that regard. She is not just a simple pick. She is ruthless by design. She opposes the aging tactical staple of “kill the healer first.” Instead, she is a close range healer that encourages high health pools and tight knit groups. With multiple teammates to guard her and a high sustainability she is not going to be that simple pick. That “Overwatch Old” strategy falls apart. This means tactics from this character must change and adaptation is finding new life in my favorite game. Since Moira encourages tight knit formations, the strategy changes from “kill the healer” to “divide and conquer.”  Moira, being a close range healer, needs to be separated from the majority of her team to disable her healing. If she is too far away, she cannot speed boost, Guardian angel or snipe to heal her mates. Instead, she will be forced to use her fade. If she does this, she becomes much more predictable and easier to focus down. If she does not, she will only have her healing orb to provide aid to distant allies, which is far better for the opposing team than a healing orb combined with primary fire. To me, Moira also enables Mei for the team that opposes her. Mei is equipped specifically for separating the opposing team and sometimes isolating singular characters at a time. Roadhog is also adept at separating characters from their teams. Roadhog is better at bringing Moira down than most, but hooking anyone removes them from healing range and, of course, into range of a face full of rusty bits.Junkrat. He punishes clustered enemies. Pharah. Punishes clustered enemies and can force them apart with Concussive Blast.I hope more characters of varying specialties are given to us in the future. I always love to see a game evolve past it’s own cliches.","

"Mercy and Lucio also have similar survivability to Moira, as you pointed out Moira's is worse as once she uses fade she becomes a sitting duck.Moira's real strength and the one that comes up most often in complaints is her ability to duel. No one cares that Mercy flies around the battlefield because she doesn't really hit back. No one cares that a good Lucio who can wallride and hit his shots is both hard to hit and hard hitting. Moira does basically what a good Lucio does and outheals your damage and hits you back hard. She has low dps but the almost guaranteed nature of it means it's a 4 or 2 second time for her kill squishy characters.

The survivability itself isn’t new, but she is admittedly easy to learn. On the flip side, the two most popular flankers to take down the main healer are Tracer and Genji. Lucio is not the main healer and his value from speedboost is arguably better than his healing song and also easy to grab value from as is his viability near ledges on certain maps. That said, I know Lucio needs a little buff love. Moira is easy to play with low average damage because there isn’t much else that can counter the popular flankers and still be so close to balanced as a healer. She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.","

She can get it done, but the high skill ceiling of Tracer and Genji means she can still be taken out(I know that it’s difficult). If she didn’t have pretty much exactly her kit, she would not have changed the game the way she has. If she had no soft lock on her primary, Tracer would be mowing her down still and very little would have changed.I don't think her kit should be changed. I think Ana, Mercy and Lucio need some buffs(in that order for priority). If they're not Blizzard needs to decide what they consider a balanced support is. If it's Moira then other people needs buffs, if it's Zen that Moira may need some slight number tweaks and she's head and shoulders in a higher tier than all the other supports.I can agree with that.","

Massive heals and damage.That comparison is very shallow. Allowing a similar team composition does not mean they both are countered in the same way(or not at all). Moira can be separated and her healing is diminished. Ana can snipe heal. Ana wasn’t an anti flanker. Ana had no resource meter. Ana had a better ultimate.,"

"There is another side of it too.For most of match making, this is the first time there's been a viable healer that actually has the raw healing to sustain a teammate through nearly anything a single hero can throw at them.  I mean seriously... if you stack Moira's left click and heal ball, you are looking at 155 HPS.  That's a bit insane.  Most heroes can't chop through that alone without ridiculously good aim.Suddenly... you can't handle Moira with the two ways you'd normally handle healers... Those being either kill them as you mentioned or simply land way more damage than they can heal.  Instead you need to either shoot something that Moira isn't healing, force Moira to bail, force Moira and her healing target apart, or insta gib one of them.  This is causing problems for a lot of people because I've noticed that especially around my level... they are pretty bad at target priority and if you go lower I imagine it gets worse.","

"Here's just one idea...FPS exploded in popularity (at least on consoles) after games like Goldeneye/Perfect dark... which were then followed by the huge hits like Halo1, Halo2, and then of course Halo3, which is about the time the Call of Duty games showed up and started eating halo's market share.Since then, FPS games (again, at least as far as consoles are concerned) kinda peaked... and haven't much evolved.  We've all heard of the CoD/halo clones and how generic they are.In all of those^ games, it was all about GLORY.  How many kills can you secure?  I still remember when Halo2 dropped and it was the first time I'd heard of a ""K/D"" spread... after that... it's like all my friends and I cared about were how many kills we got.  And even then, those kills didn't matter if we were dying a lot.  So anyway, shooters peaked, and companies are looking for ways to switch up the formula.  One of those ways is to introduce game play that forces cooperation and focus on objectives, rather that just going and out securing kills each. and. every. game. like the last 50 FPS titles we've played over the earlier years.I know I mentioned consoles even though OW is a PC game... but my point is... I wouldnt have touched OW if I hadn't first played those other FPS's on consoles.  Those earlier games gave me the confidence to just try in the first place, because I knew aiming with a mouse/keyboard would take some getting used to.At any rate... gamers need to adapt to OW, and those that refuse, well... they're gonna have a bad a time.","

He just kept returning to curse at me even more. I went to spectator and just repeatedly kicked him until he gave up joining, but not after a few players left, and Match chat received some of his choice P*/D*/F* words.Can we please have more control over blocking abusive players?

"As stated, Blizzard has stated that we already know or have ""met"" Hero 27. That stated, a barrage of who that may be has gone rampant with everyone grabbing at even the slightest mention of a throwaway character. This is my personal opinion of the best possible choices for a new Hero and the worst:=-=BESTBrigette Lindholm (Dragon Slayer Comic, Reflections Comic, Honor and Glory Short, Character Interactions)=One of the few characters with the most mentions and connections to other current Heroes, she is definitely a show in, especially after Blizzard created a character model for her in the Honor and Glory Short. As far as her role, I see her as a Defense character like her dad, maybe being able to fix or reinforce characters' machines/ shields, etc. Liao (First Strike Novel [CANCELED], Hero Document Hints [Ana])=As much as they redacted the First Strike comic, they still mention Liao on the Atlas News Articles as well as the documents hinting at Ana being the first new character. Be an interesting new dynamic if Liao was a duo with his/her robot companion, like the Ice Climbers or other similar duos from video games. Athena (Reflections Comic, Recall Short, In-Game Announcer)=Many people have been clamoring for Athena to be a Hero ever since they released the first concept pieces and even the cinematic trailer with a white feminine-looking robot that bears her logo. She has a big presence in Overwatch and to have a character that is an AI versus the likes of other current Omnic heroes would be interesting.Queen of Junkertown (Wasted Land Comic, In-Game Junkertown Announcer)=Another fan favorite, shows a lot of personality. Not only she has a character design as shown on posters all over Junkertown, it'd be cool to have a ""royalty"" character and have other characters mockingly referring to her as ""Your MajestyHammond (Map Document Hints [Horizon Lunar Colony])= A story arc introduced but never continued after the release of Horizon Lunar Colony, be interesting to see another animal creature butt heads against our main party animal, Winston.Olympia Shaw (Recall Short, Atlas News Articles)=She has a voice actor and character model, and she could be a news reporter turned field journalist. Concept art for her have drone cameras flying around so be a cool ability to have on the Overwatch battlefields=-==-=WORSTEmily (Reflections Comic)=Tracer's Girlfriend. She doesn't really have any shown traits and abilities, let alone enough lines to convey some kind of personality. She seem rather plain Jane and is meant to be someone in Tracer's life.Sanjay Korpal (A Better World Comic, Masquerade Comic)=Like Emily, Sanjay was just meant to be another Vishkar operative alongside Symmetra. He seems like an average Joe and doesn't even seem to possess the same powers as Symmetra does.Maximilien (Masquerade Comic)=Doesn't seem like the fighting type and his design would be similar to Zenyatta in a suit. A character that, while has a specific personality and role, is best kept in outside media, not in gameSam (Reflections Comic)=Pharah's dad. As much as I'd like a family dynamic, we barely have any info of him. We have more information of Hammond than we do of ""Sam"". Like Emily,he's just meant to be someone who is connected to a character outside of the gameKatya Volskaya (Searching Comic, Infiltration Short)=Highly doubtful she'd exists as a character within the game than a major plot point for Zarya and Sombra in Overwatch mediaThe Meddling Kids (Cinematic Trailer)=They're kids. Pretty sure Blizzard frowns upon killing kids in the battlefield, least if they want to keep that T for Teen rating. While people have been clamoring for them too, the most unlikely to happen. Sure Blizzard could age them but the timeline is messed enough to have the character retain their ages.Alejandra (Searching Comic, Hero Short)=Again, she's a child. Same reason for the above.Hakim (Old Soldiers Comic)=I've seen some posts about him but he seems more like a throwaway character than anything elseHarold Winston (Recall Short)=He's dead. As much as Blizzard and Overwatch characters love pulling the ""I'm dead but not really"" (Ana, Soldier 76, Reaper), Winston must have had some time on the Moon after the other subjects on base killed the scientists before escaping. That meaning he saw them murder Dr. Harold Winston. Gerard Lacroix (Reflections Comic, In-Game Mentions)=He's dead, like above. Widowmaker visits his grave in the Reflections comic which means there was a dead body to bury unlike the Return from the Dead trio who were assumed dead since their bodies were never recovered. Unlikely that Overwatch would pull a Zombie character on us.Mayor Nandah (Uprising Origin Short)=No.Guillermo Portero (Sombra ARG, Castillo Arena Map)=No.Lynx Seventeen (Searching Comic)=While a cool snarky character, his design is very similar to Zenyatta's and we already have a Hacker character=-==-=Let me know of your personal opinions or if there were any other characters that I have missed to mention. Of course, if you feel like someone should be or shouldn't be a hero let me know why!","

"Sanjay Korpal is one of the worst? Nope, he is probably one of the best. In Moira’s origin story, you can see him sitting on the far left of the Talon leaders’ table (and that is very clearly him). In Masquerade you can also see him at the Talon leaders’ table next to Doomfist (albeit not as similar). Why would a ‘background’ character appear in three different pieces of media?

Especially when in Asia it's a last name first bases.  Since people seem to be Liking what I've been speculating, it if is Liao, I'm going to add this as my speculation as to what his kit could be. 12/29/2017 08:33 PMPosted by TidalWavesI've been batting ideas around since the summer and i posted this in another thread and people seemed to like it, so I'll add onto it. I'll also admit that I'm writing things on AO3 involving both characters mentioned on AO3. Ideas for speculated Hero: Fan design WIP based off a pannel of the first strike panel, the blue visor guy from the recall short AND a hero concept : https://tidalwavesstudio.deviantart.com/art/The-missing-founding-Member-Blackwatch-Liao-WIP-707836001Name: Lee LiaoCallsign(s): Phantom, Lotus, Helio, Rey Leon(Lion King) Age: 48 approxGender: maleBirthplace: SingaporeLanguages: English (fluent), Mandarin Chinese (fluent), Malay, ocassionally uses ""Singlish"", Usually when annoyed and most often under his breath, Omnicode/ Omnic Script (Due to his implants). Rank: Captain/ Blackwatch Second in commandAffiliation: Singapore Armed forces & Lion force/ Overwatch and BlackwatchLocation: Went MIA prior to the Zurich event (Hiding in safehouses in Asia and South East Asia. Rarely visits Singapore unless Talon activity is observed)Specialization: Tech/Robotics ExpertClass: Tank or Def HeroHealth: 200 or more depending on classWeapon type: Modified SAR model rifle.Primary fire- Pulse Fire:Clip size of 15-20 with an average to slow reload time (again depending on class)Secondary fire -Plasma shot:Clip of 3-5 that does more damage but with a 20-30 second cool down timer.*Other Abilities: see bottom notes.Ult: 愿狮子保护我 / ""May the lions protect me""An ult in where he calls two lion mechs/ robots to his side, the male Jiù zhǔ (Savior) casts a small shield from his right shoulder while the female Yōulíng (Spectre) does something more offensive maybe, like a damage over time weapon like a flamethrower?Backstory: Liao's Pre Overwatch Life is known to few, but those who do know know that the man was a genius who had earned several degrees (in Biotech -implants for domestic and militaristic use, and prosthetics- and Robotics engineering) and opened his own company before 18. In that time he created two miniature Lion drones to preform simple scouting tasks.When he turned (**)16, he and several friends joined the SAF as reservists where they trained and eventually fought on the front lines, helping to holding down half of the island nation while trying to reclaim the other half from the Omnics. During that time he would go on to lead and form a small special forces group called ""Lion Force"", which remained operational after the Omnic Crisis. After the liberation of Singapore, Liao was sought out and asked to become a founding member of Overwatch despite being the youngest member at 18 years. His quick wit, stealth and drive to finish a mission using any means possible earned him the respect of Reyes who later asked him to help form the covert ops group Blackwatch.Sometime the golden age of Overwatch he worked Closely with Mei, eventually earning her ire and distrust when he stole Cyrogenics research in an attempt to weaponize it. This began to further go down hill with the eventual departure of both McCree and Genji. As Tensions grew in Overwatch, Reyes was deemed to be unfit to continue leading Blackwatch, but when Liao went to relieve him of his duty, a fight broke out with Reyes taunting and threating Liao, which only caused the Singaporean to stab the older man and start a fight.Both men escaped with their lives, but Reyes was greatly wounded while Liao had lost his left eye and was partially blind in his right eye after the older man had shattered his visor.Luckily he had been developing a new kind of implant/ cybernetic prosthetic to help those who had lost their sight trough various means, as well as to help the military by providing them with an ocular lense that included a Combat HUD. With the help of Mercy he became the sole test subject of his new occular implants and spent years improving and updating the combat software and rotating around safehouses while making ""hit and run"" raids against Talon. Eventually he managed to track down Ana and helped her recover as well, disapointed that she did not accept his offer for an ocular implant like himself. After recovering in Singapore, he left, returning only once durring the ""Bras Basah"" incident in late 2076 where he took down a small taskforce of Talon agents with his Lions. The only knowledge of Liao's status at that time was the two large gold Lion mechs. After the incident, Singapore's security tightened even further, making life much more difficult for Talon.In mid to late 2077 Liao was once again sighted in Lijang China, and recognized when his accent slipped while he left out a string of ""Singlish"" as he fought. His identity was confirmed when a Talon operative pulled his visor up off his face. Luckily Mei was able to step in and aid in Liao's escape.Once again his whereabouts are unknown, but based on his actions against Talon he is willing to answer the recall. It's speculated that he's close to 50 years of age.Due to his implants, he can read Omnicode, something that only augmented humans can read and understand. He's known to be somewhat shy and flustered around cute women but there are rumors that he and Mei were once involved and she helped him to largely overcome his shyness towards women. He can be spontaneous, and is a self proclaimed ""savage, Sarcastic, $#!t giving @$$#073."" He likes to keep busy and keep things interesting as he'll ""go crazy"" otherwise. Outside of a charm his mother gave him as a child, and a dragon bracelet givent to him by Mei, he wears no jewelry outside of his SAF and Overwatch dogtags. While unmarried, he wears a ring on his dogtags and gets rather moody when asked about it.It's extremely rare to see him outside of his uniform or in a short sleeved shirt. On his right arm he has a tattoo of two chinese Lions and a dragon in black white and red -basically a tattoo with no color and basic shading- that runs from his shoulder to his elbow, a sign of drunken dubachary with is Lion force Squad during the Omnic crisis.*Now As i said this is just something I've been screwing with for the last few months and I have little idea of balancing I have no idea which of his abilities would be overpowered a friend and i were discussing things and we agreed that maybe instead of both Lions maybe he could switch between Lions like Sym does with her ult, or he could command the Lions separately to more minor effect as an ability or something. It could also be possible to cancel his ult maybe if you take out one of his lions putting them on any abilities using them on a cooldown? the thread I previously posted this in liked the idea of two lions and there seems to gen a small group who want a hero that uses a flamethrower. Some people Like the idea that Liao could use his lions independently -outside of an ult- and destroying one could roleblack him or prevent him from using his ult until the Lion's cooldown ends.Again I have no idea what character balancing is, and i'm just messing about with ideas.**Long story short, Singapore has mandatory enlistment, so that they're ready in any situation. some countries allow you to join the army Reserves at 16 whereas in Singapore minimum age to enlist as a reservist is 16 and a half. In the omnic Crisis they likely dropped the minimum age to 16. i posted more in a thread titled ""whatever happened to Liao"" Trust me, I've really expanded on the possibilities of Liao's backstory, abilities and such, but I tried to keep things brief in this post.","

"I don’t know how some of these things happen but any of you die in super unlucky ways that can almost seem to unlikely. Or just so dumb ?Most of these happened when I was invis with Sombra. I was running behind a Winston and he turns around and turns on his Tesla gun instantly making me visible and then started to kill me. In the death cam it shows him try destroying his own widows poison trap and continue to try shooting it then I run by and his gun auto shoots me . Another time I almost felt like this was too impossible, but we are on Anubis and defending, their team is outside the point A enterance and I was invis going to run outside to hack the health packs. The team had no Hanzo or widow to uncover me yet a Roadhog manages to hook me. I was completely invisible since it takes a second to go invis and on the replay shows the hog just randomly hooking into the air, then grabs me, like was he just testing out his hook at the air or was he expecting someone to just come through the enterance... What are some unlucky or dumb ways you have died?","

"One of the main problems with CTF in Overwatch is that there is 2 objectives: defend your flag or capture the enemy flag. In a team based game where staying together is key, this doesn't work so well. Here are my ideas to add a version of CTF that would work even better for Overwatch.Players have to take the neutral flag which spawns in the center of the map to the enemy base, which converts it to that team's flag and can now be captured at your base. Once the flag is converted, it is basically CTF like how we have now except only with one flag.Neautral flag spawns at the center of the mapScore by taking the flag to the enemy base to convert the flag, then take the flag back to your baseUsing any ability while carrying the flag will drop the flagCannot pick up the flag while any ability is activeNo flag returns when the flag is neutralOnce your team has converted the flag, the enemy team can return the flag, which sets it back to the center of the map and makes the flag neutral againFlag pickup time: instantFlag dropped lock time: 3 secondsFlag return time: 3 secondsWhen the flag is captured, it resets to the center and is locked for 10 seconds2 roundsFirst round time: 6 minutesFirst round ends early if a team scores 3 flagsSecond round time: same as first round6 flag captures to winOvertime bar should not freeze if the currently winning team is the team holding the flag at the end of the second roundSudden death on draw","

"Massive downvotes inc as this forum love low skill ceiling heroes being able to have massive impact, like Mercy& Junkrat.First, I want you to watch this video in the time I linked it, so you truly understand the context, the engagement, and how does it feel to fight a Moira, incase you don't play DPS at all, you won't really know how it feels.https://youtu.be/lgL0Er3UAQg?t=382That video comes from Kragie, a proffesional player currently in London's Spitfire academy team, which will be playing Contenders, a league below OWL, consistently top10 tracer player, Rank1 multiple times, incase you say ""bad dps""Here we go, this is gonna be explained with plenty of details1- The first argument people say when trying to defend Moira is :""DPS players are just mad because finally a support can fight back""Wrong, it's not the fact that Moira can fight back, it's the fact that Moira has ALL the advantages and her kit sets her to win the fight vs the majority of the DPS RosterAna can fight back, she can land 3 shots on you and you're dead, or 2 and a Nade, or land the skillshot known as Sleep Dart and kill you.Zenyatta can fight back, he discords you, rightclick you instantly oneshotting you, or simply left click headshot you once and bodyshotting onceZenyattas in the OWL have massive impact, even getting 3-4 kills per fight and carrying, as shown by JJonak vs Seoul Dynasty.Zenyattas in the OWL take the 1v1 duels against Tracer and they do win them with a decent percentage, Rawkus shut down SBB during World Cup plenty of times.Lucio can fight back, he's incredibly hard to kill and since his projectile speed increase he can land headshots on you and take you down.What's the difference, all those require SKILL to win against a DPS.Moira doesn't have to aim, she has a 6s CD on one of the best mobility abilities in the game, she has insane HP drain, range, and 100% accuracy damage, an orb to fully top her if she's under pressure.A support is not meant to have THE EDGE when engaging a DPS in a fight, he should be able to defend himself and win if he is the better player, like a good zenyatta does.2- Stats, Moira has completely replaced Mercy in the top1 hero across ALL ranks.She is oficially the most picked hero in the game as of right nowHaving 11% pickrate in GM and 55.72% winrate, she's really not that far off Mercy that used to have 15%+- pickrate.Having 11% pickrate means she is close to be in almost every game, and still manages to have almost 56% winrate, as she will be in both teams the winrate can't be much higher as one has to lose.3- Excels at TOO many things and has no weaknessesAna: used to have the best healing potential, a high impact ability in sleep dart, and a high potential to make plays with Nade.0 mobility, no sustain apart from nade which is a long CDZen: very good utility with discord, crazy damage potential, best support ultimate0 mobility, gigantic hitbox, no sustain as regen doesn't work in combat, low healing outside of TransLucio: good utility with speed and boops, good mobility, good sustain.Low healing outside E, people have to be grouped up to make his healing effective, sub par ultimate as there's too much damage in the game and Trans is much better, low damage compared to other supports, slow building ultimateMoira?Best heals in the game, fastest charging ultimate, best survability in the support category, 2nd best moblity among supports, very useful ultimate specially if combined with a good tank frontline, ability to completely zone out flankers, ability to win the fight against the majority of the DPS roster, ability to finish off kills with ease, ability to put pressure with damage orb, ability to combo healing+ healing orb doing insane amounts of healingWhat's the tradeoff? basically nothing, with ana you trade amazing heals and utility for poor mobility, with zen you trade amazing damage potential and best support ult with poor mobility, a giant hitbox and low healing4- Skill needed to be impactfulZen is technically OP by looking at his winrates, pickrates, tournament play and overall utility in the gameHow many people do really complain about Zen? How many ""Genji mains"" complain about zen?Transendence completely nullifies dragonblade's impact, making it useless.Do you see any outcry of genji mains crying about it and making countless posts about it? I don'tWhy? Trans is a slow building ultimate, more or less, unless you are one of the best zens in the world and get headshots nonstop every fight, which doesn't happen and if it does, it still doesnt build as fast as Moira's.Zen trades off 0 mobility, a gigantic hitbox and low healing for the best ultimate in the support category.Zen has the highest kill potential out of any support, do you see people complaining about getting killed by Zen? I don't, why?Zen takes a lot of skill to land the shots, so does Ana with sleep darts, hence they deserve to have such impact.Moira has no real mechanical requirement, her beam doesn't require aim, just looking at the general direction of the enemy, her healing isn't exactly very mechanically demanding either, her orbs also take next to no skill, and she has a 6s CD skill that gets her out of danger and allows her to gain range to keep distance and drain HP back.5- What can be done to make her balanced?Reducing the amount of HP drain per second with the damage beam ( Most important change needed )Increasing Fade cooldown to 8 seconds from 6.Increasing the points needed to get ultimate, making it slower to charge.What does this mean?Moira will still be able to zone out/kill flankers/DPS, as she still retains her range, and damage.However Moira will not be able to duel DPS heroes mindlessly knowing she will win, as the HP drain is reduced and they could OUTDPS in an easier fashionHer ult charge would be on par with the rest of the heroes, specially support heroes.Players would need to think when is the right time to fade, instead of spamming fade as soon as there's any danger as it will be back very fast.This is basically it, now I know people are gonna comment the typical arguments, haha tracer/genji main, moira is not OP because... I have fun with her! and the rest of the poor arguments that they bringGo on, I really don't care about your poor arguments, this post will be checked by the people that matter, I'm pretty sure they're aware of the issue anyways.I wrote this as Im bored with the current ranked situation, it's pretty much a joke with the onetricks ruining games. unbalanced MM, trolls and throwers, I gained elo today and didn't even feel good about it as the quality of games was horrible.I expect Moira nerfs soon, cheers!","

"Many of DOTA 2's heroes are considered low skill, especially support heroes. Some supports like Rubick (a squishy mage who can stun and steal enemy abilities) are harder to use than, for instance, Omniknight (a straightforward, tanky support with an AOE heal and the ability to turn his entire team invincible). Funnily enough, most of them have about the same impact. Some more than others, but not always. They bring different things to a team. Rubick can copy and repeat gamechanging ultimates, while Omniknight can grant invincibility to pretty much all forms of damage. It's good. Maybe if Blizzard were good at balance, there wouldn't be threads like these made on the daily because every support (and, indeed, a good deal of heroes) would be balanced.Too bad.","

"I'll play Devil's advocate and say I agree with you (I do for some of this and agree she is a bit too versatile but overall find it to be rubbish) the nerfs you suggested are ridiculous. The only reasonable one is making her ult require more points since she really does get it every team fight. If she were to get nerfed, it'd be making her HP drain only give her 20 or 30 hps a second. This way she demands for people with proper positioning to do dmg and recharge her resource over getting careless and flanking all the time. She'd be easier to kill for DPS but she wouldn't be overnerfed. Either way, she has her healing orb or a second healer to help keep her up. But aside from that and her ult charge, she's perfectly fine and is in a good spot.","

A hero based around dodging, movement and mobility (alongside Genji) is picked in a scene where people are incredibly good at aiming, with sharp reflexes. Wonder why that could be. Guess their aim's just !@#$.I think Moira's heals shouldn't cleave an entire team (she has the reverse Ana problem- instead of being able to heal a single tank up to full, she has the ability to heal multiple tanks rapidly), probably should be limited to two heroes maximum (or require more juice for healing more heroes). I also think her ult charges too fast. That's it.","

"I think people hate him because it's easy to be on the defence, pick a Bastion, and have people almost instinctively pick Reinhardt and/or Mercy to complement the pick. From there, the plan is easy, defend the Bastion while he defends the point.When you're on the attack however, coordination seems a bit more scattered. It's difficult to rally everyone or utilize counter picks to dislodge the defence.That said, he is fairly weak. I have a lot of trouble with him, personally, but I've seen better players deal with him with ease...","

"Bastion is a really good counter pick when you're in the middle of the match and lacking a good defence against tank-heavy or flank reliant comps. Most players don't see him coming, and by the time they adjust their strategy he already has his ult up and support backing him up. I've changed the course of many payload games by pulling out Bastion and he can absolutely decimate teams when unsuspected.The problem many people have is with the low skill ceiling involved when playing Bastion, because he hits like a tank. However I disagree with many people when they say he's a complete face-roll,  I believe he takes a certain amount of map awareness and decision making to be decent. A good Bastion will never go turret mode in the same place repeatedly, he will always be running around and setting up in different places constantly to catch enemies off guard.Basically to summarise, he guns down your tanks, catches your flankers by surprise, and forces you to re-think your strategy a lot of the time.","

To reach somebody for a rez that died on a roof or something that I can't reach.

"Even after the nerfs to Mercy I find myself now forced to play Moira :cI know Moira is balanced, and Mercy has the stigma attached to her still, but there's one other character who I ADORE and wish I could play. Ana.Probably one of my favourite characters EVER. I adore her story, and I love her character. Protecting the ones you love really fits with who I try to be as a person, and I love how the devs even managed to get that feeling across with her ABILITIES. Something really special that they totally nailed on the head here.Though I wish I could actually play her again WITHOUT being a liability to my team :/Ana is STILL struggling to find a place in the game after all the nerfs, even the MUCH needed damage buff wasn't enough to really bring her back. The game has just changed and evolved so much since she was last really in favour. I would like her to be a viable pick along with Moira and Mercy.So for that I offer TWO buff ideas;Increase her Ammo count to 15; make it less punishing for Ana to miss, defend herself, or healing targets where 75 hp would be a ""waste"". Ana is still the only support with as much downtime on healing. Moira's regenerates passive AND is refilled by helping attack; Ana's is used up for healing and attacking. Reloading is Ana's BIGGEST weakness for healing that gives her these weird periods of not being able to do anything to really help the team in a meaningful way. It wasn't as bad when her Grenade gave 100% heal bonus and she did 80 damage because the risk of missing and reloading were rewarded with more power. (Though they did need to be nerfed, there needed to be compensation somewhere else in her kit to make up for the 50% and 20% nerf)ANDGive Ana a healing passive based on her theme of being a ""mother"" and ""protector"" where she heals hp based on the health of the target she is HEALING using only her rifle (Grenade doesn't count) so she isn't better in 1v1 duels BUT can at least heal up chip damage and stay in fights30 hp for healing 200 or less hp targets20 hp for healing 250 to 300 hp targets10 hp for healing targets with more than 400This way it rewards skill hitting smaller targets, giving you more health AND spamming into tanks doesn't make your health regenerate super fast spamming into them. Plus it will only work healing MISSING health, not just standing there spamming into a Sentry Mode Bastion to get your health back.I think that would help sort her biggest issues of survivability and consistancy; which every support has 0 issues with. They can still be killed, but they're not just free ult like an Ana is currently.Hopefully someone up there in the sky sees this and chimes in, but I really do miss playing Ana without being threatened every comp game","

You'd think with Moira and her massive aoe healing Ana's nade could rule supreme, but with it only lasting 4 seconds now and it's long cooldown, I don't think it will be enough. Her sleep dart is simply not reliable enough to rely on it to make an impact, and her ult is lacking to say the least. Ana needs help!Make Ana great again!#maga","

(I'm also not saying Moira is overpowered, Ana and arguably Mercy lost too much impact)The problem with buffing Ana to heal tanks more is that she's already SO good at it. It's healing the lower health, and smaller characters she struggles more with that Mercy and Moira don't with their lack of aim requirements.Moira can spray and use her orb, and Mercy can triage forever. Every time you shoot as Ana you're getting closer to loading and downtime so it's MUCH harder to keep up more than 2 people even WITH her grenade in the current way the game has been balanced.And your English is spot on :P","

Ana was the only support who could keep up a lot of high health targets, now Moira can do that with less effort. Ana's ult struggles as well with mobility since it's easier now to escape from the boosted target, and when Discord is a guarantee to give someone a 30% damage reduction, why bring an ULT that is only a touch better.If they came out and said; we're waiting to see what happens to Ana after the Mercy nerfs settle, I would be okay. However it is still a sad though that Ana was SO bad for almost a YEAR before she even got her damage buffed to 70 :/I kinda get this sad feeling they're SCARED to really buff Ana because of how salty people got when she was good, without realsing that the game is 100% different from then to now. Lucio, Mercy, andBastion have been reworked, Roadhog and D.va aren't the same characters, Zarya and 76 were nerfed, Reaper, Sombra, Junkrat, and Orisa were buffed, and Doomfist and Moira were added to the game.You nerfed Ana in the perfect spot when you took the heal bonus down, and the duration of the Grenade. Now please fix her core issues so I don't get screamed at for not playing the current best support. I want to know my pick has a 50/50 chance of winning, not knowing that most games end with Ana being on the losing side 40/60","

"02/08/2018 07:20 AMPosted by GollyWizif they give her a better rate of fire and her nade can heal over time like moria she should be fine. also maybe a faster reload or a slightly bigger clipHer rate of fire keeps her healing balanced; Her current healing is 90 hps, the highest in the game. Buffing that would put her a touch too goodHer grenade is perfect the way it is; it got the much needed nerfs, and doesn't feel like a total ""Oh I win"" button like it used to. Plus can't say no to that 100 bust health. Plus I don't want every support to overlap, I like how they each have their own ways of bringing something to the table; why I want Ana's passive healing to be tied to her healing done, no other support has that effect.The faster reload or bigger clip are what she REALLY needs. Either less downtime on her healing OR to be less punishing for ""over heals"" and defending yourself.","

Unless you quick scope as Ana, because her unscoped primary is a projectile, the hitbox on it is JUST big enough that it will tend to hit a barrier rather than a friendly or enemy target","

"02/17/2018 11:33 PMPosted by Tophershe can 1 shot tracer and 2 shot any 200 hp hero and he pellets are rather large.1. only in close range and only if you headshot twice and only if the target does get healed or shielded. On a range of 55m you need 5 headshots or 9 body shots to kill a target. By 0.8 sec per shot it would you take atleast 4 sec, if you only hit headshots on that distance. And if we now also think about accuracy on that distance. Yeah. there is no way you gonna kill someone.Hanzo can 1 shot every hero 200 hp hero. Is he a good dps? Take away his scatter arrow. Is he still good?""Yeah Mei is not a sniper you idiot!"" Yeah. So you have to be pretty close to an enemy, less than 26m to deal full damage or less than 10m to freeze someone. While having no escape ability, no movement ability and the worst selfheal ability in the game.Soldier heals in a area of 5m 40 health per sec for 5 sec. Can still shot, move, ult etc. (15 sec cd)Bastion heals himself for 75 health per sec. Can still move. (no cd)Tracer can heal herself back to full health and get out of the fight/ sticky situations. (12 sec cd)Roadhog heals himself for 300 health in 1 sec and still move while taking 50% less damage. (8 sec cd)Ana can heal herself instant for 100 hp. (10 sec cd)Moira can heal herself for 75 health per sec using orb (10 sec cd) or 105 health per sec using orb and secondary.Mei only heal herself for 37.5 health per sec in a duration of 4 sec. sure she cant take damage while doing this, but she also cant move or do anything. 4 sec not doing anything and just gets 150 health back.","

"So for clarification, I wanted to emphasize beforehand that I am using Zarya in this situation. I am getting so tired of getting yelled at by my team for holding my ult. It's not because I don't want to use it, but rather when I spam ""group up"" and ""ult ready"" together, only maybe one person ever shows up (usually a healer). I had a Genji today who got furious at me for holding my ult practically the whole game, even after I tried to explain that I had repeatedly messaged that I wanted the group over a period of about 5 minutes. Only ever did Ana show up. I never knew where he was and didn't want to squander my ult. The same goes for the rest of the team I had in that situation. Everyone except Ana kept just kept doing their own solo thing. Same thing yesterday. Only my friend (playing Moira, mind you), ever really wanted to capitalize on my ultimate. I don't want to waste my ult-- because Zarya's is amazing when used correctly. But if it's wasted, it takes quite some time to get her ult back. So am I in the wrong? Should I do something else?","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If you keep finding yourself waiting for a moment that never comes, yeah, you're wasting your ult by not using it. There's not much you can do to make your teammates group up better. So work with what you've got. A few two or three-man gravs is better than one that gets four.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"I mean, in most cases, just having at least one other person that can follow up on your ult effectively is enough to turn a game.

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
Yes and no. Its right to save ult but after awhile you might as well use it since in the time you hold it you could have built another. Dont be afraid if you see the chance to grav 4-6 ppl. Plus you can capitalize on grav by yourself if you are 80+ charge. And in most cases people here a zarya ult and look to find it. So just get into the mentality of I can build this back up so as long as i can use it to kill at least 2 or so its good. Dont waste it on solo though. Imo,"

						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"Most flanking dps (especially Genjis and Tracers who benefit from Zarya's ult) cannot join the tank because of their positioning. They are flankers, and if you are playing with an aggressive player, they might not be able to make it to your tank's position safely.In short, it is too much to expect your entire team to group up behind you if you are not playing a Reinhardt and running a deathball comp.Instead, when you call out your ult, your Genji/Tracer should call out their ult in response and tell you if they have it (or what %). You can then coordinate your ults that way. Assuming you're not using voice and can't type to ask for someone to tell you their ult status, that's about the best you can expect.If they're not responding, hit tab and view your team's status. It will display their ult status as a checkmark below their name. You can track ults that way and hope they are paying attention to your ult line.","
						Feb 19
					",,,,,,,
"If nobody is coordinating with you, then figure out a plan B. If you can't orchestrate a big teamwipe (or even a couple of guaranteed kills), can you solo ult/kill a high value target? Can you pull people off of an objective or off of an advantageous location? Can you save your supports by locking down the flanker who's trying to kill them?Basically I find for me that it's helpful to not just know what your ideal circumstance is for getting max value out of your ult, but also having some options for working around unhelpful teammates. Hopefully you won't need to call on that option too often, but in solo queue you're probably gonna need it now and again.","

"1100 hours on Mercy (almost all those hours are from comp on PS4) taking a break from the game for a few reasons.1) I haven’t asked for a revert on Mercy. I thought she was OP with her double insta res during ult and needed tweaking. However, I find her so unfun and underwhelming to play now. At least with old Mercy when you pulled off a sweet res you got to feel like a badass. She’s more balanced now and still a great healbot, but there’s no longer a moment to really shine. 2) The toxicity in game is another reason I’m leaving. It is terrible on PS4. I find it amusing that people get instantly banned for a week on the forums for saying something silly like “so dumb” (no joke), yet I report someone in game for telling a 13 year old to go kill themself and nothing happens. With all the Mercy hate lately it’s been even worse. I dropped from high masters to mid-diamond, I’m female, and I have a platinum boarder...you can only imagine the crap I’ve had to endure.3) The smurf problem on PS4 is the last reason. I’ve posted extensively about this, but according to Jeff, smurfs aren’t as big an issue as we make them out to be, Mercy is fine now, and toxicity has improved...and unfortunately from my perspective, I disagree. I still enjoy watching OWL and will continue to do so, but for now I will enjoy being just a spectator.","

"02/10/2018 02:54 PMPosted by EquinoxIf only 25 other heroes and a mute button existedI like playing Mercy (obviously), and I do mute and block people. It still ruins the experience when it happens as often as it does. That isn’t Blizzard’s fault - it’s crappy human beings. I was in skirmish the other day waiting to get in a comp match and some guy asked if I was a girl then said oh you sound like a whale. That happens all the time. Sure I mute them and chug along, but the damage is already done.","

I would love to come back if Mercy gets the changes she deserves (and I agree that is not a revert), but I don’t see that being any time soon based on what Jeff has said and historical evidence.I would also like to add that OW really needs an evidence-based report system. I used to take the time to make Twitch highlights of throwers after games and include the link in my reports. It was pretty frustrating to find out no one reads the reports and punishment is based off of # of reports.","

"Hello, I'm Robo. My favorite hero in Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support is Tracer, Hanzo, D.Va, and ZenyattaMy main is TracerMy favorite ability is Pulse Bomb, its so satisfying to stick :DFavorite skin is a tie between Cadet Oxton for Tracer and Soldier's Alpine. I would like to learn Widowmaker.My tip for playing Tracer would be to never be under 120 HP. Ever. 125 if they have Hanzo. I think having a meta is okay, but I would rather it not be there. It doesn't have as much of an impact in the matches as people think. My favorite OWL team is probably NYXLI watch KarQ and Erstadan, KarQ is my favoriteI think people play tank the least. I think people don't play tanks as much because there's not too much feedback, like with DPS you get the elims and with support you get the healing, utility, and saves, but with Tanks (not D.Va, Hog) it just feels like doing nothing half the time in my opinion.

Sanzang (i think thats how you spell it) for ZenyattaWhat hero would you like to learn? Moira or WidowmakerIf you could give someone a tip to playing your main what would it be? Please for the love of God remember to use Fortify. It can stop a lot of things and if I remember correctly it cuts down the damage you take.What type of hero would you like hero 27 to be? I'm guessing a tank that screws up the dive meta. Right now the only tanks that do that are in the dive meta themselves.Do you think having a Meta is a good thing? Kinda of i suppose, I mean I don't like how some treat the meta as a sacred text that must be followed.What is your favorite Overwatch League team?

"Favourite hero in each category: Sombra, Mei, Dva, Mercy Main: Mercy favourite ability: EMP least favorite ability: Tactical visor Favourite skin: Zhuque (think it’s spelt like that) for MercyWhat hero would you like to learn: AnaTip for main: Never Rez during Valkyrie, it’s a waste of time when you could be healing and you get melted. Hero 27: Defence who could be a solid counter to high mobility heroes e.g tracer, Sombra and Genji Is meta good: yes becasue it helps you win and no because it excludes a lot of heroes Favourite OWL team: London spitfire and Houston OutlawsDo you watch Overwatch Youtubers: Bro you wack and Guzzo Least played role: support and tankWhy: Supports are constantly nerfed or ‘changed’ to the pontiff where they are either underpowered or unfun to play and tanks don’t feel rewarding to play as well as they don’t have a objective other than stand and bloack damage which is dull when’s you could play dps I met a girl called Kayleigh and we are now pretty much best friends, we play overwatch together and we play other games with eachother, I met her in Comp and she added me becasue she’s liked how I played mercy and how nice and chill I was in comms. I made most of my monumental changes on overwatch with her; climbed to diamond with her And I climbed to masters with her. Got through every mercy nerf patch with her and she’s reassured me it was okay to play and she’s was still playable. We made even more friends playing together such a a girl called molly who was the nicest reaper main I had ever seen. And we’d met jake (unfortunately no longer talks to us as he doesn’t like us) but he was the most amazing dps/ tank player ever. Soon we added Ed to the list the dva main who climbed from silver to platinum. We met Gabe the most amazing Mei player ever with god Wallasey that would change the fight and save us all. I have made these friends and we are close as close could be and I woudlnt change it for the world. We grew together as players and as friends even though living in different parts of the world. Belgium, Sweden and the UK. I thank the overwatch team greatly because I would never have met these people without this game and I cant imagine life without them. We pick eachother up when we are down and even though we aren’t as close we all know when it comes to the weekend it’s ps4 party and overwatch time. We have the greatest times and Kayleigh’s laugh is contagious, jake’s jokes left us all in stitches, gabe’s sarcastic and evil comment he’d make when murdering the enemy team as Mei, Ed’s killer tunes that would pump us up for the fight, molly creativity and strategies that would get us cheesy victories and finally me, I don’t know what I did for us but they say I’m the glue that keep saying us together, I resolve disputes and make sure everyone isn’t on and has op haopy  what they are doing. And I made them laugh with my panic screeches walking back from spawn trying to get back in time to Rez or heal or something. They changes my life and it’s because of this game. I sincerely thank the overwatch team, the community for everything’s as I wouldn’t be here today as the confident and strong person I am now. I hope you all find friends and make the best memories on Thisbe game because I know I have and I wish people could to.","

"The big hooplah mostly come from one (or more):- Mercy's ult feels like it is does not have any impact in any way. Apart from flying and being able to chain within 10m, it's the exact same thing that Mercy does for the rest of her kit all the time and it cannot save a team if they're losing a fight unless it's a very very close fight.- Mercy's ult is boring to use. Same reasons above: it's just basically her normally, but flying. - Rez feels wonky to use. It makes you feel like you're moving through sludge when every other part of your kit is designed for mobility, you can't heal while using it, and you can't use it in the middle of a fight unless the person you're trying to rez died in the very back far away from the fight or they died behind a wall.Almost none of her kit requires any thought or planning now. Any. Whatsoever. It took away what little bit of decision making Mercy once had. Are you starting a team fight and a few people have low health? Okay, use Valk and stay in the skybox for 15secs. Is someone dead, no one on your team is in need of healing, and the enemy can't see you? Okay, use rez.","

She now has a niche and its not always useful.Which is bad, because everyone mained mercy because she was always viable with and aggaints every comp, she rewarded good players and punishes those who didn't know how to play her (except for the sr exploit).Now she lost that and its sad to see how she is useless in ult form.","

There are multiple heroes who can shield you while you res. I've seen it done before with my very own eyes, shielding Mercy while she res's. Teamwork!

They'll be targeted even while glowing, and they won't be able to react on time once they can move.-RIP Tire. Hide somewhere safe, then go for the kill.-Rocket Barrage. Normally a suicide button, against a team that's standing still and can't react on time, you have the element of surprise.-Self Destruct.

"Correction, only her standard kit is in a good place (e.g. healing, damage boosting, pistol usage although very rare, guardian angel with bunny hop) but her ultimate is no where near in a good place. It's simply a spectating ability and must be one of the most boring and least impactful ultimates in the game at the moment. It doesn't even deserve to be called an ultimate. Resurrect as a standard ability, in its current state, is pretty much a suicide button if your team doesn't defend you near a fight.","

"Let's look at it like this: do you ever dread having to use recall? Deflect? Defense Matrix? Boop? Because that's how a lot of people feel about rez; it incapacitates you to the point that you spend 2 seconds wondering will I survive this? The only ones I know who feel anything similar are Hog and Pharah mains who uses their ult, and those players often avoid using it because of the vulnerability. However, the risk of them comes with the potential to more or less team-wipe, and they still do damage and can somewhat defend themselves. Mercy players lose all agency when they rez, and the reward isn't even that great since if the Mercy dies immediately after the rez is completed the rezzed person often dies as well. And, unlike a Pharah or Hog that doesn't use their ults, Mercy players are often subjected to hate when they decide it's not safe to rez and get called throwers. Nobody should have to fear using something that the devs apparently envisioned as part of her regular kit. If something has to be put on such a long cooldown and have so many restrictions it's just not meant to be an ability, period.","

"#1. We should have Save (overwrite) and Save As as separate options.It's great that we can save configs now. However, I find it really weird and awkward that when I need to edit a config, the only option I have is 'Save as' (even though it's called Save), meaning that when I edit a config and save it, I'm offered to save it as a new one.90% of the time I just need to edit an existing config, not to have a new one. It's only natural that we should have separate Save (overwrite) and Save As options, because Save and overwrite would be used much more often.#2. When I edit a config and choose Save As, the suggested name for the config should be based on its current name, it shouldn't be my nickname.In addition to that, I find it very awkward that when I edit a config and then save it as a new one, the default name for the config is my nickname. When I'm saving from an existing config, it would make much more sense if the default name would be derived from the name of the config I'm editing. I.e. if I'm editing ""FFA Random Heroes"" config and choose Save as, the suggested name should be ""FFA Random Heroes (1)"", not ""Jekyll"".#3. Do not allow to have several configs with the same name.The game should NOT allow to have several configs with the same name! It only creates mess (especially since without save/overwrite option and with the default name being your nickname you're bound to accidentally create configs with the same name). The game should always offer a different name and should not allow the same name.I know it all might seem like minor things but when you often practice or have fun in custom games alone or with friends you often have to introduce small adjustments into your configs, and the current system makes it really awkward.","

"02/18/2018 04:42 AMPosted by RaymondWhen you save an edit of a config in custom games there is an option to make a new save or to override it to an existing one.No. There's an option to select and apply a saved config that will overwrite the currently selected settings only (which essentially isn't even an overwrite, it just applies the settings from the selected config), but the saved configurations are not altered in this process whatsoever. To alter configurations you have to use the Save button on the right. Which functions as a Save As button. When you press it, you indeed get a menu that lets me select a config to be overwritten, but it's an exceptionally weird and awkward way to do that. Why would I need to manually select a config I want to overwrite, then manually enter a name for it (because it suggests my nickname) instead of just having a ""Save"" option that doesn't ask me anything?In other words, all three of my suggestions seem valid for me.","

"Sombra isn't being buffed against Reinhardt, so this is just about her being in more games, right?Well, if she does show up more often, she'll be replacing a DPS. That DPS may be the Junkrat or Bastion who's been shredding your barrier recently. Or it may be the Tracer or Genji who's attacking your backline, ignoring your barrier entirely.Sombra can only hack one hero at a time, so if your barrier does get hacked, your off-tank can step in with their abilities. You can also body-block damage with your large, heavily armored health pool. Sombra's weapon has not had its damage buffed, merely had its spread reduced, so it isn't any stronger against tanks. Her rounds are also in just the right range for your armor to mitigate its damage. Most likely whoever she's replacing on your enemy team would have had much higher DPS than she does.To be honest, if I were tanking against a Sombra, I'd rather be a Reinhardt than an Orisa. A smart Sombra (dumb Sombras won't get much done) will hack Orisa right when her barrier needs to be refreshed; this leaves her with a barrier that's about to break, a smaller health pool than you, no Fortify, and a primary fire which is less suited to shooting agile heroes at close range and which slows her down when she's using it. I think you're going to be more effective hacked than she is. And a hacked Winston is a giant, lumbering hitbox with a tickle gun.","

"02/18/2018 03:29 AMPosted by LafMy real issue is that he can’t heal tanks well at allWell yeah, that's kinda his big weakness.But to be fair, what other weakness does he really have ?He's faster then Tracer, more mobile then Genji, has crazy good self sustain if you know when to amp up, and if he has all of his team around him - he out HPS Ana or Mercy without even needing to Amp up.Even his damage is decent now - a full hit of headshots + melee + boop can burst down a 200 HP hero.He's not really a good pick for a solo healer if your team is Tank Heavy, that's true - but on a team that is less heal intensive (I.E, you've got a Hog as a tank) you're gonna do fine more or less.","

"I started playing him too last night and he is a blast to play.Yes, I was having issues at first with maybe 3K match heals but towards the end of the night I was getting 6-7K'ish(of coarse length of match plays a role).  Maybe with more practice I'll get higher.I noticed the tank healing issue at times.  One thought is that his heals could be based off of a proximity box.  Stick to the tank like glue and he heals a lot quicker?  Outside that proximity box and things heal as normal.","

"The issue is more with the map design of Junkertown as opposed to Bastion. People try the pirateship here and there on other maps, but it is easy to break with a smart engagement (e.g. on Route 66 first point defense), thanks to the map allowing for it. If you get the Bastion off the cart literally once, you've beaten it. If they try to force it when the cart has rolled up far enough already - they are essentially throwing. (Since the walk from spawn to cart will be too long).I have had good success on Junkertown playing a Hog on defense. I've gone on a flank and hooked the Bastion (or Mercy) from the right side house, before they have set up (but not showing myself too early), and getting that initial kill while still having the access to the cover of that house if need be. Their team will sit on the payload and push it for a little bit before they are taken out in the teamfight, which ideally makes their subsequent setup really hard since the travel to the cart is longer and your team can play corners better without them pushing the cart.Of course there's other ways, but yeah.","

I can see where it may seem unbeatable. But it isn't. It's a team effort to do it. It takes more than YOLO trickling to break it.

"Hero experience and proficiency aren't taken into account when the matchmaker assembles teams, and this is a big problem.  We might have a single SR/MMR score but the unfortunate fact is we don't play all heroes at the same level.BTC does a great job of summing up the biggest issue in matchmakinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtMr1IjQ_E4&t=345s (go to 2:18)I don't quite agree with his proposed solution as it seems too complex for this game and would require overhauling the player experience.What I think instead should happen is, when the system is putting a team together it looks at the heroes each player can play at or near their level.  It then filters out problematic team compositions based on this and doesn't let them form in the first place.  The matchmaker system needs to ask itself one simple question before it commits players to a match, ""Can these guys put together a workable team?""Is it about to put 2 Mercy one-tricks in a team?  NOPE, pull one out and swap in someone else.  5 DPS-only players?  Pull 3 of them out and put them back into the pool.  (You could at least swap them for one of those Mercy one-tricks from the other game!)Tired of playing your hero, want to switch and don't want the system to assume you're permanently a D.Va main?  Play alternate heroes in quickplay and improve your stats on them.  Then when you queue up for a competitive game, the system knows you're good on heroes X, Y and Z, and takes all of them into consideration when it puts teams together.","

A good example is, How often are you in a game and someone clearly is not good at what they are playing but wont switch? I would love to see an option to OPT OUT of games that will have grouped people in it.

"I really feel that instead of changing RP entirely, all they need to do is look at DF as a combo character, instead of a one-shot character. Somewhat like this:-Rocket Punch: wall damage changed from 50-150 (depending on charge) to 25-50. When hitting a wall, the enemy is stunned from 0.5s to 1.25s depending on charge.-New addition to his passive: when hitting an enemy with an ability, the cooldown of the other basic abilities is reduced by 1s / 1.5s.With this changes, he becomes a character that is able to use more his abilities and combo them. He would also have more survivability, because of the extra mobility and shields he would get. He wouldn't one-shot people anymore (except Tracer), but he would have the reward that is stunning the enemy and being able to finish him off with his gun or other ability. The fact that he wouldn't one-shot ppl would also make it easier to increase a little bit the hitbox on the punch without causing an uproar on the crying babies of this community. Much better overall, more fun and less frustrating to play against. In addition to this, if he happened to be too strong, just reducing the damage on his Uppercut or SS slightly would be enough. Also, his ultimate should reset the CD on his basic abilities, or atleast activate the passive.","

The problem is, it gives a small push, its and ultimate that doesn't really do much. You yell I WILL WATCH OVER YOU and then you watch as your team dies if even one enemy uses an ult.-It lasts too long so it can't be buffed without becoming over powered.-It automatizes her teams hp management -Its healing is substandard for an ultWhat I'd like to see is either1. Reset cooldown on res, no other changes to res, no lowered cast time, no double charge, only reset the cooldown on res.or2. Increase healing/damage boost the closer she is to an ally.

Remember Platinum is still above average.Obviously further nerfs is something we all want to avoid. If she were to revert, I'd want to keep a lot of the positives of the rework with her, and try and avoid a full revert. I don't want to bring back the days of hide and seek Mercy, ""Kill her 1rst or kill her 11th"", and the old rezzing an entire team from the next room over.I propose:Ultimate (Rez) gets a cast time and a LoS requirement.New ability is Valkyrie, granting Mercy the ability to fly on her own and increasing the speed of her guardian angel.OR Valkyrie could chain heal or damage boost. When healing, the first target is healed for a higher HPS.Even if my ideas end up being bad or poorly balanced, I'm still afraid I have to side with the people that want her reverted. You can't balance a 30s rez without nerfing her into the dirt, and I don't think that's a situation anyone wants.","

She would still have the extended beam and GA-reach, but she would have to actually fly to the bodies to rez them, making ""hide n rez"" impossible and easily countered by either focus fire or an ult like Tac-Visor or High Noon.Her new E could be a high jump (similar to Pharah's rocket jump, but slower) with a small knockback that Mercy could use to get to high places (and boop unfortunates off cliffs), while split beams are put on her reload key and on a fairly high cooldown (15 seconds or more).

Enabling her to heal allies in danger even faster while potentially damaging the enemy going after them at the same time.Valkyrie though? It just gives you the ability to fly and make your general gameplay have a chain effect. It lacks the focus other ults have which results in everything being diluted.

						Feb 18
					",,,,,,,
"I'm not a Mei main, but i've put a lot of time into her over the past couple months. A big thing is working on those headshots with alt fire. Anyone can hit a frozen target, but if you can land one on someone pushing the supports, they're gonna back off. Tracer especially will have to be careful around you, because you can 1-shot her.If you're gonna ult, stack your freeze from your primary on Zarya first (So she cant save anyone else), then worry about heroes with Mobility. If you can stack it on Orisa then great, but if she's got fortify then there's really no point in trying. Make a habit of breaking walls quickly when using them to get to higher places, as if you die they're stuck there the full duration of the wall.Oh, and you can wall off Torb Turrets and Super chargers (as in placing the wall directly on them, not just in front of them) to stop them from functioning. (You can just use your primary fire to freeze a turret, but the wall is faster and safer, especially during molten core)One more thing: As far as I know, Mei's wall does NOT block her ultimate's LoS. So you can surprise people by throwing your ult at your wall where it cant be eaten by a defense matrix.Edit: As of right now, Moira orbs still do go through Mei walls, so just be aware of that when you wall yourself in somewhere on low HP. A Moira orb may just materialize and kill you if you don't have cryo-freeze available","

"I had put some time on mei too although im a Dva main. I can give some suggestion about habit.1.) Always use icicle as primary damage rather than secondary, because i saw a lot of mei player try to use freeze spray to chase down enemy but got themselve kill instead.2.)Wall is ur most important skill during war#teamfight. Walling off tank and other during choke point, while walling dont aim for ground but aim for side or top of door it will reduce mistake of walling too far or too close.3)Wall can cancel junkrat trap so always try to use it when trapped.I got more minor tips on mei's habit if you wish to discuss with me. you are welcome to add me.","

"<--- Top 50 Mei player w/ 200+ hours in MeiMei is a hero that needs her team to play around her, much like other niche heroes. She works best in deathball compositions (deathball meaning you have a 2 2 2 including Reinhardt and Lucio).First and foremost, do not be trigger-happy with your Ice Wall. People will try to sneak round corners and then quickly pull back in order to bait it out of you, which you do not want.On certain maps such as the Numbani point A upstairs choke point, you can get the enemy suck in the ceiling, which is actually ideal, because they're completely immobilised before you've even frozen them.If you feel that you're too far away from the enemy to get a good Ice Wall in, then save it. There's nothing worse than a wasted Ice Wall.Your cryo-freeze should mainly be used to bait out CC abilities such as Roadhog's hook, McCree's flashbang, etc when you find yourself in a 1v1 scenario. There is however a bug which causes Mei to sometimes be pulled out of cryo-freeze by these CC abilities, which gives you an even smaller window of time to predict when they're going to try and stun you.Mei's ultimate is best used for zoning, since it can cover entire objectives. It takes 3 seconds to freeze people, but can be sped up slightly by stacking with your primary fire. Try to steer away from using your ultimate when your Ice Wall is on cooldown. You can wall off the side of the ultimate that the enemy is closest to, to minimise their chances of escaping.It's possible to achieve a 10 second freeeze by freezing someone, and then dropping your ultimate straight to the floor as soon as they're frozen. With the Mei buffs on the PTR, you no longer have to completely freeze the target with your primary fire to achieve this.When you eventually find yourself against another Mei, it mainly comes down to who is more accurate with the primary fire, and who starts freezing the other first. If you start freezing first, you will force out their cryo-freeze. You can use this time to reload, as they have to remain inside their cryo-freeze long enough for the slow effect of your gun to wear off. Before they come out of their cryo-freeze, start using your primary fire on them. By doing this, you will be the first to start landing the primary fire again, giving you the advantage. When you headshot her, make sure to melee immediately afterwards to finish her off, since Mei has 250HP. The same applies to Reaper.","

I'm not proud of it. But the dumbest reason for someone to throw comes from yours truly. I dont know why i threw this game...maybe Because it happened multiple times in the last few months on comp.The reason I threw was because my team refused to communicate. Hold up I make it bad.Every game I joined someone had a mic (I know how lucky) But they never used it. Unless someone on my team also had a mic. I did but it chose when it wanted to work. This kept pissing me off game after game if we win they said nothing. But they complained if we lost.One game someone had a mic but they weren't using it. Even though there was six people in the chat. Then a miracle happened. My mic started working so i could communicate with them. They communicated back. Then my entire team put in there nice and started doing callouts. I dunno why I got triggered but I did and left them to 5v6. They apparently lost thanks to a message from a teammate.I feel bad about it and this is the only match that I have thrown. Please don't ban me:(,"

"Anchor Tank is the official definition for Reinhardt and Orisa, which partially corresponds to what we call ""main"" tanks. Together with Winston, a dive tank, we have only 3 primary tanks (4 if you want to count D.Va), which makes the situation a little stagnant. Winston in particular is by far the preferred choice in the current meta. Regardless of the next hero's identity, be it Junkertown Queen, Hammond, Liao or Mama Hong, I seriously hope it's going to be an Anchor tank with an anti-dive AoE knockup of sorts. After all he / she is rumored to be meta-changing, so it has to be a Winston / D.Va counter.","

Some people want a defense character just because we haven't had a new one since release, but true defense characters are hard to balance. Look at Bastion, Mei, and Torbjorn. Hanzo, Junkrat, and Widow are more offensive than Doomfist even is.But basically it boils down to their being about 16 dps and only 6 tanks, and 5 healers. We could always use more tanks and healers, the more there are, the more tank and healer mains there should be which is good for the game.","

"Before you start trying to attack me, it is not the reason you think. The reason I do not ship Tracer and Widow is because of one small headcanon I have: Tracer knew Widow before Talon got to her. Now you may be saying what does that have to do with anything? Well sit down my friends while I tell you a story.According to the Wiki Lena (Tracer) joined Overwatch in its early days and the age of 25 or 26 to be a test pilot for them. Then all the stuff with the supersonic Jet happened and Lena became - quite literally - a woman out of time.Now before we go any farther, let’s look at Amélie (Widow). Her bio says she is 33 but it isn’t that hard to assume that whatever is keeping her heart from doing its job may have also have stopped her from aging. We also don’t know when she was kidnapped but I suspect it was within 10 years Overwatch being founded. To be honest I have nothing to back this theory up other than that my gut tells me it was when the world still viewed Overwatch as amazing.So, with Tracer being established as one of the central agents and her proclivity for getting in people’s faces, it isn’t that hard to imagine that there would be a connection there.Now, if you don’t know Widow’s lore this is the short version: she gets kidnapped, brainwashed, “rescued” by Overwatch agents, and then murders her husband two weeks later. Overwatch thinks that the story is Talon came and murdered her husband and kidnapped Amelie again and has no idea where she is.Since I’m done with the lengthy backstory, let’s get into it.  Any good young adult knows the best food is free food. Tracer, I believe would be no exception to this. So with the wonky side effects from being disassociated with time, I believe she would probably hang out with / mooch off of her co-workers. And who better to mooch off of than a young married couple in their early thirties who are sympathetic to Lena’s case? No one that’s who. So years later, when Lena is practically another member of the Lacroix family, Amélie gets kidnapped and you know what happens after. After seeing the death and disappearance of the two family members, Lena begins to hate all forms of death and vows to do her best to never take a life. (Remember the game is non-canonical. Also if pay attention to both the Alive and Museum trailers, Tracer is never trying to actually hit. In Alive especially, it is obvious she is buying time.) You can see the anger on her face when Widow succeeds in hitting her mark.However, why does it turn to horror? Is it because of the fact that  it is a really unsettling laugh? Maybe so. But then why didn’t she fight back at all? Was Widow to fast for the girl who controls time?I think it was something more.I think in that moment her face changed to one of horror because she knew that face. Lena remembered the smell of pizza and the sound of laughter echoing through a small apartment. Of countless games of monopoly. Of Uno, poker, any game really. And of a young woman who loved her husband enough to deal with the chance of him never returning from the fight but knowing that he was doing it to make a better world for everyone including her. A young woman who make the best pastries Lena had ever tasted. A woman who was always super competitive and had an evil chuckle that both Lena and Gérard loved to imitate. A young woman who never failed to send Lena off with a breezy “Adieu, chérie”. A young woman Lena had spends months of sleepless nights searching for. A young woman who she finally found. A young woman who pretended it was business as usual. And the young woman who disappeared again.The young woman who would be Tracer’s biggest regret is staring her in the face and Lena hasn’t even recognized her. Remember the line from towards the beginning of the Alive trailer? Tracer says something to the effect of “Here to crash another party love?” This isn’t the first time they’ve met. I’m sure that even with Overwatch gone Tracer is still trying to prevent what she can. Since Widow likes to go around ventilating heads, I’m sure she’d be high on the priority list. And now she figures out that the woman who she has been trying to find any trace of is here in front of her but completely different.So I don’t think that Lena and Amélie would at any point form a romantic relationship. They might become friends again but that is unlikely because of how distorted Amélie has become and how much pain and guilt Tracer would go though just seeing her again. Also - though I haven’t confirmed this myself - Widow remembers enough of Gérard to call for him occasionally when rezed by Mercy. IN CONCLUSION:	Do I have any evidence for my theory/headcanon? Not for the bulk of it.	Do you have to like what I say? Nope.	Do I read way too much into the lore of this game? Most definitely yes,	Do I think I’m right? I very much hope so. But more than anything else I want to think that Tracer had a family. Maybe not by blood. But I want to think that she was the annoying younger sister to a group of people who loved her. Because I’m sure she had a terrible bout of PTSD after all she went through. 	So a young couple invited her over for pizza and Monopoly.Nothing was the same again.Welp that’s enough of that. Sorry for the long read and any feels this might have caused. I’m gonna go hang out in the corner now with the rest of my headcanons. Feel free to ignore me completely.","

"Damn, I've been uploading a chapter by chapter fanfic (no erotic contents) about the events leading upto the Slipstream failure and Amelie being kidnapped, and it's based on the exact same premise as yours. Here's the link and  summary: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12081678/1/Slipping-Through-The-FingersGerard Lacroix is heading an investigation that may lead to Talon, a mysterious terrorist organisation. Overwatch command has placed young Lena Oxton in the care of the Lacroix couple, and the three soon develop a family like bonding. Lena, a dull lonely girl, starts to regard the Lacroix couple as brother and sister and learns to enjoy her life day by day. One of the founding member of Overwatch, Gabriel Reyes, believes Jack Morrison is taking Overwatch in a wrong direction. In the meantime the Slipstream, a very expensive and highly publicized project, approaches its milestone.There's an error with your age calculation, though.The game is set 5 years after Overwatch disbanded. Lena Oxton is 26 presently which means she was 21 when OW disbanded.At 21 she was already a gun totting field agent with the time thingy on her chest. The OW HQ was blown up when she was 20 and I don't think any organisation would run a project the scale of Slipstream when their HQ is blown up. So Slipstream incident must have already happened when Tracer was younger than 20 years old. Again, I assume OW would not let a minor to testpilot a prototype time travelling airplane, so we can guess that Tracer was picked by the Slipstream project when she was 18 or 19. I'd go with 18 because it gives enough time for her to pilot the Slipstream, get lost in space and time, come back, have the thingy on her chest installed, and operate as a field agent. A lot of life changing !@#$s happening within 2 years.","

"Something else I would like to add. The reason some people don't mind back filling is probably because they don't experience it often. If this change were added, then the number of matches people who didn't have back fill disabled on, would see an increase in the number of matches they get back filled into, since other people have  now avoided it.","

That implies that backfilling really is something no one likes to do?Also there is the xp penalty system as mentioned previously, which works in deterring most people from leaving too many games.I don't mind backfilling from time to time, but I would like to mostly be able to play games from the beginning, y'know? I'd like my arcade time to look like something other than queuing for a minute to lose a game after 30 seconds.That's why I said some players mind it and some don't. Those who don't mind it could have this option turned on, those who do mind it could turn it off. Would you suggest something else to prevent this backfilling issue, like increasing the xp penalties or adding some other type of penalty for consecutively leaving games?

"The worst part about backfill is that it normally happens 10 seconds before the end of the match, and the enemy team has a huge snowball going. You've definitely lost.What then happens is the whole of your team will leave at the end of the match, and you'll most likely be forced to requeue.","

"While I do agree that backfill currently is extremely terrible, I don't think it should be disabled. If that happened then when someone ragequits you might as well too, because nobody is coming to fill that empty slot. I think the bonus should be granted based on time. If you backfill a match at the start of a game, then you get a small backfill bonus + match XP. However, if you join into an embarrassing stomp with 10 seconds left, then you get a massive backfill bonus. Maybe even give the backfiller the XP of the quitter.","

"I don't play much Reaper, but from what I can tell he's about as underpowered as Mei, and they are giving Mei minor buffs so Idk why Reaper wouldn't get any. -Increase his speed in wraith form by a bitWhy? Because it is incredibly easy to just chase him down if he doesn't get any healing. An increase in speed could allow him an escape or a better chance to find either some healing or his teammates.-Decrease the time it takes him to teleportWhy? When he teleports there are 2 seperate moments where he becomes a sitting duck and can easily be headshot by a number of weapons. Decreasing the time it would take for him to teleport would decrease the total time he is a sitting duck and the likelihood of him getting killed or very damaged. Its not an amazing ability in the first place so it probably shouldn't be countered so easily.They could put this on the PTR and see how it plays out. I'll try to imagine a number of reasons as to why they have not done this yet:A. They are still brainstorming ways to buff Reaper and they aren't quite ready to share them yetB. Their focus is on other heroes right now, Reaper is farther down the listC. They don't think Reaper is really underpowered, just that the meta doesn't favor himD. Their data implies that Reaper is fine how he is, so they would need more community feedback to sway them to look at potentially buffing himE. Something else entirely. Its most likely E or a mix of different things, but it was fun to think up these scenarios lol","

I really hate all the arcade gimmicks. I just want to play the regular game. So naturally weekly lootboxes are only rewarded for winning arcade games....This is really ruining the game for me. After I suffer through all the arcade matches I am just burnt out on the whole game and don't even want to touch it until I have to do it again next week.This needs to stop. Either make it so I can get the lootboxes in quickplay and comp or make it so both wins AND losses count so I am not stuck doing this BS all day long if my luck is bad.This seriously needs to be fixed,"

"There's no rush. You get a week to do them. Play your QP and comp games first, and then hit a few arcade games before you log off. Leave the arcade games until the end of your play time to avoid the burn out. Do the same thing everyday and you'll eventually get all the wins way before the week is done. I do 1 arcade game to 3 QP games. So if I play for an hour or two, I'll usually get 2-3 arcade wins per day.","

It had a huge pay off- yes. But it’s capacity to work was largely on darchig people out of place, or placers with slow reactions. The thing with rocket punch is nearly EVERY hero doomfist can KO with rocket punch- has a direct means to avoid dodge disrupt block interrupt or otherwise ruin rocket punch over and make it not work. And these are all things they can do AFTER doomfist begins his wind upThings important to keep in mind about rocket punch:It takes a minimum second to full charge the ability. It’s range and damage are based on that charge time. It slows doomfist to a crawl while charging and holding the ability.While altering his posture, lowering his head making it easier to land critical shots against him And makes him glow like a Christmas tree. And he screams like an autistic child in the middle of a REEE moment- it’s one of the loudest abilities in the game that lets you HEAR not only that he’s charging the ability, but let’s you know EXACTLY where he is while doing it. The majority of its damage requires him to knock you into terrain Specific terrain- as not all surfaces with work. And at specific angles. Because if it’s too wide of a shot, it also won’t work. And if the day happens to be a day that end in a “Y”, the doomfist player is required to roll a D20 against a picked at random skill check value to get the bonus damage. And the ability can not be aimed on a vertical axis Instead doomfist can only fire it on the horizontal.All coupled to the largest DPS hero in the game. With absolutely the most hard counters. So even when the hit box WAS generous- the ability was not not that powerful. Slam and uppercut combos to secure take downs were still the best bets- with RP best suited for escapes. The “problem” for RP- is its one of those things that frustrates poor play, and suffers against good play (like stealth characters in MOST games).  RP could “quickly” KO a player who didn’t know how to react to it. But against good players who DID? Game sense went (and still goes) a long way against doomfist. Being aware of your surroundings, and simple positioning with your team and it’s tanks are the biggest. Heroes run at 5-6 mps From the time he starts winding up. You have a literal 10-12 meter bubble of mobility you can use to reposition and break LoS. Be it terrain, or a team mate. Even hog suddenly makes a great meat bag nody blocking tank.If you can’t get around that- use your abilities. Seriously everyone has one short of like zen, even ones that seem odd. There’s obvious ones like reaper going into shadow form, Mei blocking or walling. But even odd ones- junk rat (who is also a hard DF counter, largely because of this), can toss a trap when he hears the sound. That trap will place and arm before DF can fire- and it’ll catch him. This is true for all hero’s who place things, I’ve literally seen symmetras drop a turret on the ground- and DF plowed into that. Emphasizing again these are all things they can do reactively. Rocket punch should NOT be difficult to land. It ALREADY has more draw backs than ANY other ability in the game for the most part. That’s NOT to say it needs to be the size of a freight train, but for the most part of you get hit by RP, even at launch- it was largely your fault. Doomfist is omen of those heroes (ok, like most) where if you have trouble with him you’d be benefit BIG time from playing as him to see and learn how to play against himThis wasn’t largely why I picked him up originally. It’s the same for many heroes on my list- such as tracer and Genji. I found I liked his kit so he’s me most played now overall, but I still have more hours OFF him than on him. These are all things I do often to ruin his day when I play against him. So take it with a grain of salt.","

"Rocket Punch is:Mobility, allowing Doomfist to quickly travel 20+ meters on a short cooldownA stun that goes through barriers, useful for interrupting enemy abilities and ultimatesA potential one-shot, if you can line it up with terrain A combo tool, letting you get a quick 50 damage out at close range and setting the enemy up for an easy finisher with your Seismic Slam + Uppercut combo.It isn't as buggy as people think it is.

Similiar to last year, but this time it takes 1 second or less and can take damage during pick up. My reasoning is this will make it more of a team effort to pick up the flag instead of someone swooping in grabbing it during the chaos of the defense fighting off the offense when they go for the flag. You have to work together to get it. The only time this isn't applied is in sudden death.Just my thoughts on the matter.","

I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers.

"02/18/2018 02:27 AMPosted by DløadMy friends were really curious about overwatch because of my stories. They joined this free weekend to try it out. They were not amused by the toxic community. As I played with them every game (after the first two) had a (genij) smurf wrecking my newb friends and after winning they started provoking. My friends did not enjoyed the overwatch experience. I tried to convince them that these were smurfs, but that would not hold back their decision for leaving the game. I just want to put this out here, the free weekend is more of a bad marketing than a good one. As I see more of these kinda topic's. Overwatch will stop to exist if they dont acquire new customers. As the matchmaking queue takes an average of 4 minutes(including skirimish), which is long if you compare it to other games.Oh well, I guess your friends will just have to play some other FPS game where there is no such thing as smurfs...you know...as soon as a game like that actually exists.I would also wager a bet that not all those ""smurfs"" your friends were tearing up about were actual smurfs. You know...Overwatch isn't really a hard game to pick up. Some people, have been playing games like this since the original Quake son.","

"Just to let you know, I have posted this idea before.  But for some reason, I couldn't delete my post on a certain thread.  So this will be the second time I posted the same thing.I thought of a very rough concept a a while back on how Symmetra can increase her and her team's survivability with shields. But I didn't think it would really fair well enough on PTR. Even if it was tweaked a bit. So I thought that I should lay my rough concept here and see what you guys think. Remember Symmetra's old ability Photon Shield? How about bringing that back but rework it as a Passive Ability? Let's say for now it's called Photon Field. In short, have Symmetra technically act as a mini Shield Generator. It still works like the old, but less of a chore. Speaking of which, I'm certain that one of her utilities needs a change, but the one that I see that needs one for the time being is:Photon ProjectorFor starters, her Photon Projector may need a nerf but not by decreasing the beam's length. Rather, when the beam is out of range, decrease its extended time by half or more....And that's basically it from my point of view. Now describing the Photon Field. Have it work in conjunction with the Photon Projector and her Ultimates. What I mean by that will sound very complicated. But I still like to here your thoughts on it:Photon FieldWith Photon Projector: Within 5 meters from Symmetra, when the Photon Projecter reach maximum, her team gains 25 shield health.With Teleporter: Only when her Photon Projector is at maximum, all allied hero that passes through Symmetra's Teleporter gains 50 shield health. With Shield Generator: If Symmetra is alive when the Shield Generator is destroyed, all allied heroes within 10 meters gains 25 shield health.Pros: Unlike Photon Shield, Symmetra doesn't have to continuously give her team shields one at a time. Unlike her Shield Generator, the meter rule does not apply to Photon Field.Cons: In general, Symmetra needs to be alive for her team gain shield health bonuses.Photon Field does not stack with Ultimates.That's what I had in mind a while back. But again, it is a very complicated concept that I don't think it could work in the PTR. But I would like to hear what you guys think about this.","

"Given that she has been slowed down, lost 3 rez charges in total these past months, beaten, witch hunted, nerfed, reworked, gutted and the lot, would it be so bad if her now only 1 rez was instantly casted?For me, the main thing that makes Mercy unfun to play as at this point is her lack of feeling like you make an impact, and the consistent interruption of fluid gameplay that is her staple-to-the-floor resurrect. Making her resurrection instant at the least makes for smoother gameplay, and I don't feel it would make her much better pickrate wise because A), she still lacks utility and offers minimal contributions besides healing, and B) her ultimate is still lackluster compared to other Support heroes.And with this, it would even return to the 1.0 times of continued movement, crossing the battlefield countless times, topping off players, micro-managing your team and all without having to stop and risk your life by being sniper candy every 30 seconds. This would be warmly welcomed by most, I'm sure.

Right now, with Mercy being slowed and having a cast time, there's much greater opportunities for interplay between Mercy and her foes.

And if they are so out of position and picked, rezzing them again would only get them killed again+puts Mercy in a bad spot momentarily.If that was the case, why was this not consistently happening when Mercy had instant resses? People complained a lot about how Rein could just charge in recklessly, die, Mercy would GA to his corpse, instantly revive him, and now there's another 500 HP tank in the middle of their team who, very likely, was able to secure a kill with his own death.Even if it doesn't work, the mechanics encouraged it. Res people as soon as they're dead because Mercy can regularly get back out. This also lead to frustrating situations where Mercy would res anyone, including people who will just die, and hey, not surprisingly, people don't like to die, wait to respawn, get ressed, and then die immediately again for another respawn. Forcing Mercy to consider the weight of ressing someone avoids a lot of these incentives, either because the res won't be worth it, or she'll die in the process of bringing someone back.Resurrect is perfectly balanced where it's at. Mercy now requires coordination and positioning -- key skills, mind you -- to bring someone back from the dead, much like the killer of that ally had to work to bring that enemy down. Instant res just isn't healthy, and there's a very good reason why no other video game of this genre has instant revives. It almost always requires one player to be disabled and vulnerable for a brief period while bringing the teammate back. That system works for a very good reason and it's only natural Overwatch would adopt that for Mercy.","

They only take -5 damage against armor.Increasing his damage by 10% on bodyshots only doesn't affect TTK or HTK, so it's also a useless buff quantity.Buffing McCree is probably down to his mobility more than anything about his gun.  He's just so damn slow, and this can be really punishing if he's caught out of position by a fast moving comp.On the other hand, increasing his mobility means he needs to take a damage penalty, because he can't 1v6 a la Pine or Linkzr and be able to combat roll everywhere like he's praising the sun 24/7.","

Personally id give him roll with 2 charges and have his ult be able to be cancelled without losing ult charge but give it a 10 sec -15 sec internal cd if its cancelled so you don't get spammed with *its high noon* ALSO you only get 1 free bluff so it must be consumed on the next use.I would not buff him,"

The AoE damaging abilities of Rip-Tire, Self-Destruct and Meteor Strike just work off of exponential graphs where the exponent itself dips below 0 in order to actually hit 0, and the cutoff point for damage dealing isn't aligned properly, which could likely be due to the system rounding. That in turn produces a negative number and in turn heals instead of damages.","

"Here's a few reasons why:1) Everyone likes and respects him.

He is the literal embodiment of knightly values.5) He has the most amazing hair. Sigh.

"He is inspired by Don Quijote, likely had PTSD or at least hallucinations, and often overestimates his limits. plus, his kit in his world wouldn't always be very applicable. Ana had a thing for everyone she was an empowered woman and got her a piece of whoever she wanted. While he is the embodiment of knightly values, that plays into his unrealistic view on the world. His size is negligible in a game like this, but need I remind you this a game that is about superheroes, with ninjas that can summon a dragon probably made of hardlight and a sick best can make you heal over time.","

"I think if you're going to nerf the ult you should pick one thing about it instead of stacking multiple penalties. I'd fix its gravity, it's weird and floaty. Sure it can get places but it's annoying to control too.Junk's mine bounces its target. It's not even really a boop since they retain air control. Making it difficult to get a kill with the mines gives them even less utility since bouncing your enemies around just gives them free mobility. Maybe if targets couldn't move or use movement abilities while in the air it would be a sane change.Junkrat's trap is even more inconsistent since it requires a blunder on the enemy's part instead of your own ability to hit and the higher an opponent's skill the less likely it is for it to ever work. Forcing junk players to rely more on the trap without buffing its usability and calling that a buff is borderline cruel.","

"100/100 on the exponential ramp curve and 0 aim assist. I tend toward 0 aim assist and maximum sensitivity anyway, because I'm an old git and I was playing these kinds of things long before things like aim assist even existed (so playing with it just feels bizarre to me), but with Pharah you genuinely do want to keep aim assist either low or off entirely. Pharah needs to lead her shots, so having aim assist dragging your aim back to where targets are, and not where they will be once your rocket reaches them, isn't much help.edit: That said, my skills on console have dropped dramatically since I picked the game up on PC; it's really easy to go from console to PC but very hard to go the opposite way. So I acknowledge I may not be the best person to be giving advice on Pharah these days. That said, I used those same settings even when I was strictly only playing on console and tearing it up as Pharah.","

"Hi there! So I was thinking last time about maybe something that would make Valk less boring for us Mercy players and res less annoying to deal with than it is now (aka, feels like a chore/breaks the flow for the Mercy, and negates some important picks for the enemy team). I know a revert won't be happening, and I don't mind that much bc free flight can be fun (just not as it is now), so I tried to think of something that would allow Mercy to earn her reses and feel powerful when she ults, while still leaving plenty of counterplay for those around her. Before you read further, I know I'm no dev so ofc I'm open to critics and suggestions, and I'm fully aware it won't make it into the game, but just bear with me for a lil while lol Here ya go: Normal kit  Remove res from E abilityRes on E is a chore and goes against everything Mercy is designed for (mobility and engagement). It stops the flow, and is more frustrating imo to play against than mass res because Mercy has it every 30 seconds, no matter if you focus her down or not. In defense maps, this single ability can bring back that tank, that Symmetra, that Bastion guarding the gate/choke. Every 30 seconds there’s a free res potentially going off. With old res, if the Mercy had her res every 30 seconds, you knew she was quite something. Now it’s free. Removing E as a base ability rewards Mercies who work better (aka res is earned and not freely given) and doesn’t deny picks so easily. I kinda liked the fact that I had to think for my reses because of the cast time, because it was partly counterbalanced by the free reses I had during Valk. Now, the problem was that the previous version was OP, dragged matches on, but removing the insta res makes res feel like a chore and goes against the primary purpose for the rework (making Mercy engaging and eliminating hide and res)Keep bunny hop GA The mobility adds a layer to Mercy’s skill (and is really fun to use lol). I personally love it. Add either a mobility, utility, or heal burst ability in her E. A lot of good suggestions have been made on the forums: - Vertical hop- Temporary shield - Short aoe healingYou can find them by either reading the Mercy Megathread or searching for Mercy E suggestions. I can suggest for an E something like providing a defensive “angel cloud"" around a selected player to absorb a certain % of damage. Kinda like a reduced armor. The cooldown would be sth like 12 seconds. The cloud shines around the player, who then loses for example only 70% of what they should lose for 1 second. It works like a soft armor in a way that it absorbs 30% of damage. If used on a target not taking damage, there is no effect. Animation could be Mercy swinging her right arm and extending her hand toward the player, thus sending a biotic cloud toward them. Note: the ability can’t be used if there’s no one, and Mercy can’t use it on herself. It targets people like GA or Nano Boost aka you can’t launch it into empty space. (An alternative would be for it to be launchable into empty space, like Ana's nade or Moira's healing, aka the hitbox is generous but you can still waste it somehow) Valkyrie Duration reduced to 10 seconds 15 seconds is fine for the ult as it is now, although it feels boring. But if you add res to Valk, 15 seconds would be too long/OP.Speed nerf is kept Infinite ammo is kept (useful to defend herself while going in for a res or taking down pharah/widow, but it's not all that necessary either) No more constant self-regen (Mercy could have the angel cloud around her for a small period of time if it's not enough) Beam range reduced to 35-38 meters to avoid Mercy sitting in the skybox Chain healing: base target gels full 60 hps; surround teammates have half that value  It encourages prioritizing, rather than just sit and hold left click to heal/bost everyone at the same time Res: sits on the Q buttonThere are as many res charges as there are teammates down when Mercy activates ult (one charge per teammate, usable only once per teammate). If 3 teammates are down, Mercy has 3 charges and not more when she presses Q. No cast time/slow movement, but the range is the same aka 5m + LOS needed. So if 3 people are down, she gets her 3 charges, one for each player, and she has to press Q as if it were her current E. (imagine the number of charges in the middle of her ult while it's activated, like Sym's TP charges). If someone dies during the ult, they are not granted any res charge. That way, you can’t res the same guy 5 times since each teammate has one charge, and if the teammate respawns before Mercy saves them, she loses the charge accordingly. That way, a 5 man-res will be a lot harder to pull off, and if pulled right will show great play from Mercy. No more unkillable moth sitting in spectator mode; you get to have your impact, and you have to stay close to your teammates to work well. Counterplay will be to kill Mercy or keep ults, like for the old res ult. Since Mercy has to dive in and individually res, the res-ed teammates have to fend for themselves in the meantime and can be killed again of focused down. Also, if Mercy is hacked, she can't res, obviously. And she's not invincinble. No self regen -> focus fire on mercy. If she pulls of 2 reses out of 5, kill the last two for free ult charge.Mercy can now choose whether she wants a reactive or proactive res. 5-man-res will be incredibly hard to pull off with focused fire, but tempo-reses will be rewarding, all the while keeping the Valkyrie chain beam setting and encouraging prioritizing and decision-making. It’s more active overall, you don’t just ult and sit in the skybox, and you encourage enemies to save ults instead of blowing them all up → slower, more organized fights, and less “who can blow the most ults” fights with 3 people racing for potg. Typical counterplay would be to either keep D.Va, Mcree, or Soldier ult when Mercy ults, or a good Widowmaker waiting for her to res, or Sombra. Contrarily to old res, you won't have 5 people back at the same time; they'll come back as fast as Mercy can res them. Without the healing she provides during a res (and since the chained beams are only 30 hps), a newly resed teammate can be focused while Mercy goes for a res. If the Mercy pulls it off, she played well, considering she has no regen and doesn't go at the old valk speed. Early picks also won't be denied, and getting that important pick on a tank will feel significant again. Feel free to comment/criticize, as long as you remain polite. I'm not a high level player nor a developper, I'm just wondering about a solution that could potentially satisfy everyone aka feel fun and good and rewarding for Mercy while still not being frustrating for the enemy team. I can understand how old res was frustrating (although keeping a few ults can save the res, or baiting the res, the enemy team was often weakened after the fight) even though I personally loved it. It made me feel heroic, which I rarely feel now with Valkyrie. But I feel like this could work to raise the skill ceiling to Mercy (while still making her accessible, she's not supposed to be a 3 stars hero) and make her fun while still being counterable. Now, it would also mean that ""atmosphere-wise"", it wouldn't be safe to rest if Mercy isn't dead after a teamfight. It would mean that you have to stay on edge for a res like with old res or old valk. But I personally think it could work...Thanks for reading through it and have a nice day guys!

I believe there’s an issue with deflecting orbs if it’s not coming straight at you when you deflect. It happened to me where I tried to deflect it sideways just to see what would happen in a custom game and the animation and sound went off but the orb stayed Moira’s.,"

It famously happened to xQc. It’s a different issue entirely. Reinhardt’s Earthshatter has a lingering hitbox. You need to hold your shield until the hitbox is inactive, and then you can drop it. It feels weird, but you can easily play around it. If you are missing your shield timings, remember that Reinhardt’s shied also has a small startup window where he actually moves his arm for his shield to come up. Earthshatter can’t just go through a stable Reinhardt shield as far as I’m aware of.","

If he got buffed like this it wouldn't allow him to one shot baby dva or tracer and it wouldn't take three to kill a 200 health character. 250 hp characters would still have a chance to get in do damage and get out. Doomfist would have little to worry about with this change and all the tanks would still be able to go toe to toe with him as they currently do. I understand he's suppose to be a defensive tank, but in order to make him viable it would require such a boost to his shield or hp/armor it would probably be more broken than a slight damage increase would be.","

It's not like orisa's shield is that much stronger than rein's shield. I've seen people who block way more with orisa than I have but I've also seen rein's who have blocked like 70k as well. So I feel the shields are very comparable to each other.  If rein got a defensive buff it should be to his life points with more armor being added onto his crusader armor. Seriously in honor and glory those suits take way more than 300 health and 200 armor points worth of damage from the bastion and OR-14 units.","

"the most frustrating thing about rein is his ult, it feels so broken in the way that it either 1.) just somehow doesnt affect anyone in the range on it (basicly negated without any interrupts because of some sort of invisible structure) 2.) in some cases you try to ult, get flown away by a knockback ability, but the ult is still used without affecting anyone either. everything else about reinhardt feels fine (except for the sombra buff maybe). i have mained him for a few seasons and found no problems except at his ult.","

Lucio just does a jump, Zenyatta literally ""does nothing"" and Ana doesnt even have an ult for herselfYeah but during their ult they do something more than what they do outside of their ultimate. Mercy has the same thing except it’s a short AOE chain between everyone. That isn’t fun at all. People are mixing up what people are trying to say. Like initial rework was super fun for Mercy because she did a lot of stuff and she would swoop in and Rez and do all this crazy stuff but it was broken af. Then the fun factor got ripped away and we were left with this weird state where Mercy is punished really hard for using an ability and not punished at all for using her ultimate and it became boring and repetitive because there is no actual thinking of when to use her ultimate as there was with Mercy 1.0. It’s the same thing rinse and repeat every game with Mercy 2.0 and when a heroes kit becomes stale and boring it becomes unfun and people will complain. People will still pick Mercy because she has that really strong solo heal potential still. It’s just she’s not impactful whatsoever. You can see on Overbuff clearly where the difference is for Mercy. Mercy has a high pickrate in low tier because in Plat and below Mercy can successfully solo heal if you have stubborn teammates that won’t want to switch to a second healer. That’s why her pickrate is so high nothing will change that she has a strong consistent heal and she will be picked, it’s when you look at high tier that Mercy’s pickrate has dropped below Ana that her impact is completely gone. So it shows that you can still have consistent healing but your inpactfulness and what you bring is next to nothing. Also you can see that Mercy doesn’t make any huge impact with how pitiful her on fire rate is.","

"Well I only play competitive now because I'm close to my second gold gun and I don't care about winning so it exists.Will clarify though, I am not saying I throw or troll and I do try my best. It's just that there's so many of those people that its hard to care when you lose anymore.","

"I'm also one of those people, but my situation is a little different. I used to be really into playing competitive during the first few seasons but after that I stopped enjoying it because of all the negativity in comp. So for the past several seasons I only play my ten placement games during the last week for the points bundle and to prevent decay since I'm in masters. Don't think this is how competitive is intended to be played, but I know I'm not alone in doing this. I think competitive rewards really need to be reworked so people aren't forced to play a game mode they aren't interested in to get cosmetics for their favorite heroes.Don't get me wrong though, even though I only do placements I still try just as hard to win. I'm a support main and all I want is to keep everyone alive <3","

"This new version would work like this: ►Drastically reduce the time that reaper puts to teleport        ►Pressing ""E"" shows where the reaper will teleport, and releasing that             button teleports to that location.This would allow it to use this ability to escape very quickly or to engage a fightTo cancel just press the right click of the mouse when the ""E"" key is pressedFor example you are in combat and you have to flee quickly, you aim stealthily a height and press the E key which would teleport you almost instently, and if you want to be more precise you only have to leave this key pressedSo basically replace the confirmation of the left click by releasing the ""E"" key and greatly reduce cast time.","

"Moira needs a nerf on either her close-to-unlimited range or her damage. She makes Symmetra a unnecessary character and she does more damage than Doomfist and 1/4 of the roster. Moira should be more focused around healing, but still able to survive and get some kills in. Moira should NOT be based on damage.Moira is not balanced.In my own opinion and this is separate from the subject at hand and has no correlation to her needing a nerf; this is just a personal statement. I think that as a character, being a hybrid is very problematic for her. There will obviously be more future disputes about what her kit should or shouldn't be based around in the future and it will either be changed to be around damage or heals one day.Every hero gets changed over-time by Blizzard and it's only a matter of time.","

Non-issue2) But... she does lol. Who has lower DPS? Tell me. Saying ""everyone who plays Overwatch knows this"" is not a valid point. Mei doesn't count, since she has alt fire and can freeze enemies.3) See point 2. Her damage is already very low--it doesn't need to be lower.4) Unless everyone is standing in a fairly narrow cone, its AOE sucks. She's better when she uses her Biotic Orb to heal, but because of the way the ability works, a lot of the time you're not going to be able to get maximum effectiveness out of it. She's not horrible at it, just not some amazing god-tier healer even when you're basically putting most of your focus on healing.","

"Just a little positive feedback on Mercy currently. When she got reworked back in September I wasn't too enthusiastic about the changes. I tried her for a while and didn't like it but overtime I got used to it and ended up enjoying her again. The problem I faced that prevented me from enjoying her was I could not for the life of me figure out what to do with her ultimate. It never felt like there was a time to use it. Granted she could rez again after the cooldown reset but then I just felt like I was flying around watching my teammates scatter and/or die all over again. When she got the rez nerf to her ultimate I had to figure out a way to make use of her ultimate all over again. I think my main problem was that I relied on using rez too often. She should be built on keeping her allies alive. Her allies themselves should not rely on Mercy for a free get out of jail card. That's also what's been building high toxicity against mercy. Players are hypocrites when it comes to rez. They want rez gone because of the enemy,  but the moment they have mercy on their team, they expect her to rez them at all times and get pissed when they don't. I finally figured out a way to make use of her ultimate after the nerf. When charging into capture points like hanamura or temple of anubis, I pop my ult and keep my allies from dying during the push. I probably should have figured that out a long time ago. Because I don't have to rez anyone anymore during ult or not as often as least, I don't have to swoop in at close range risking myself getting killed and then everyone else dies in the process. I can focus on keeping them alive from the start. The movement nerf during ult I don't even notice. I still move faster than walking so any speed faster than that is still good in my book. I have noticed that ever since the movement changes, she gains a lot of momentum when using guardian angel and then hopping. I love that because it makes me harder to hit when I bounce unexpectedly. Whatever nerfs they throw her way I just need to adapt to. Granted tweaks could be made but as long as they don't nerf her healing output, she should be fine. Bad Mercy players and good Mercy players will be easily distinguishable when you notice their playstyle. I am a hypocrite though. I have on multiple occasions asked for her to be reverted but now that I'm used to her, I don't mind the way she is. Any F tier characters can be made viable based on the creative use of the player. Sometimes it may not work but there are those golden moments that picking this character was the right choice. Stay positive, Overwatch players.","

"IntroductionSo I want to make it clear that I think Overwatch is a great game, and this is not a post to hate on the development team as I know that they put a lot of time and effort into creating the best game and community they possibly can, I apologise in advance if this post comes off as aggressive as I do not mean to offend anyone and I merely want to get my ideas across. As a Torb main it has been becoming increasingly difficult for me to enjoy the game due to the current reporting system, that punishes off meta choices and creative strategies, due to the large amount of mistrust members of the Overwatch community have with one another.Flaws with the current reporting systemIt is to my understanding that the idea behind the current reporting system is to get rid of bad behaviour such as, throwing, being toxic, hacking etc, by having players get banned after they have been reported for these offences a number of times. In my opinion there are major issues with the way that this system is designed. Firstly the current reporting system will miss out a large amount of players that should be banned, but aren't because they do not consistently behave badly. For example if someone obviously threw 1 in 20 games that they played they should be banned, but because only 1 or 2 people might report them in that game and because they do not throw very often, it could take them ages to get banned. In my opinion if you actively throw games you should be banned as quickly as possible, but because a thrower might not throw games consistently it could take them ages to get banned, One tricks on the other hand (playing off meta heroes) are far more likely to get banned than actual offenders, as one tricks will consistently play their hero of choice whereas an offender may only throw 1 in 20 games for example. This means that if you are one tricking a more controversial hero (like Torbjorn or Symetra) because you are consistently playing that hero every game you are likely to receive a lot more fake reports from people that dont trust you, than a thrower receives actual justified reports. There are plenty of examples of players getting unfairly banned because of people abusing the reporting system and whether Blizzard accepts it or not the game is currently a very hostile environment for those who enjoy playing the off meta heroes a lot. In my personal experience I know I have received tonnes of fake reports for playing Torbjorn even though I always try to win every game of competitive that I play. This season I began asking my teammates if they were ok with me playing Torb, to try and avoid getting reported, however even when my team “lets me play Torb” I will still sometimes end up getting notifications saying I have been reported for throwing games / being inactive, which I have never done. I was infuriated by these false reports today when I logged into my game to find a notification saying that I have been reported for inactivity / griefing in my recent games, which is complete garbage because I have been suspended for the past 4 days so I have apparently been inactive or griefing while I haven't even had access to the game. I haven’t always been a Torb main and I never had any issues before I started playing the hero and so it is obvious that I am being reported based on my hero choice. As far as I know it is not Blizzards intention to ban one tricks as it has been stated that it is not a bannable offence here https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761616812#post-2 I do not know if Blizzard is trying to improve their reporting system or not however if they truly want it to be safe to one trick a hero, changes to the reporting system need to be made.Ideas to improve the reporting systemNow I don’t work for Blizzard and I don't know if they have plans for the reporting system or not however I have spent some time coming up with several ideas which I feel would make it far more difficult to abuse the reporting system and yet increase its effectiveness for banning actual offenders at the same time. I think that to avoid people getting falsely reported a “vote to report” system should be added in. This would work as follows. Step 1. Person A is throwing the game and being extremely toxic.Step 2. Person B notices this and decides to report person A and so they click report, chose the category and type in a description of what person A is doing (like the current report system)Step 3. Person B’s teammates get a notification on their screens showing them what person B wrote about person A and can decide whether they agree with person A being reported or not. Step 4. If the majority of the team agrees with the report, person A is reported.I feel that a system like this would prevent toxic players from falsely accusing their teammates of whatever they feel like as they would require the majority of the team to agree with what they said. Sure there would still be ways to abuse this system but it would be far more reliable than the current reporting system today. If you implemented a system like this you could also make it so that a player requires less reports against them to get banned as the reports would be more reliable, and this would make actual offenders of the competitive system get banned faster. Another idea I had would be limiting the amount times you can report someone a day. This would reduce the chances of someone abusing the reporting system and falsely reporting someone as generally people would want to save their reports for actual throwers or griefers. The issue with this idea is that if you used your reports up and there was a thrower you would not be able to report them however coupled with the vote to report system I feel it would work quite well as only one person would have to initiate the report on your team and the chances of everyone on your team using up all their reports would be very low. My final idea to reduce the chances of the reporting system being abused is to introduce a way for players to commend a player of their choice at the end of the game for good teamwork, and this would award the commended player with a certain amount of reputation points. To avoid farming these points you would not be able to commend yourself or people in your group. You could then use these rep points you earn to maybe unlock an exclusive weapon skin or spray and this would incentivise good teamwork and behaviour as players would want to be commended at the end of their games. You could enable people to see how many reputation points someone has earnt on their career profile and this could also help the issue of people not trusting off meta hero picks because if someone is playing an off meta hero but  has a lot of reputation points then you may be more willing to trust them. I feel that by introducing these features if would greatly reduce the cases of false reporting and make the reporting system more reliable as a whole. That is just my opinion though and I don’t know how difficult it would be to introduce features like these. Final thoughtsIn the games current state it is very difficult to one trick an off meta hero without receiving a tonne of hate and reports and I don't think that this is ever going to change, but I do think that it is definitely possible to improve the reporting system and make it better than it is now and I really hope that this is something that is being looked into. This was kind of a long post so congrats if you made it to the end, it would be great to hear what some of you guys think about this.","

"1. No hero stacking. There are 26 heroes in the game, I’m pretty sure it would be a mystery still with 20 other choices AND perhaps raise morale knowing you’re not the 3rd Ana. 2. You change characters if you suicide within 15 seconds of being damaged. This stops tactical suicide to keep your character. 3. Ultimate charge is kept upon death UNLESS the player dies with it in pocket. This mode is entirely too reliant on selfish self preservation more than teamwork and who can cast the most ultimates. These changes should keep the mode fun yet take out the coin flip factor.","

"So, it appears the next patch to the game a few Sombra buffs are going to be introduced. Blizzard's reason for these changes are understandable. Currently Sombra is basically used as an ultimate machine, with a little bit a pick potential as well as a solid tactic to draw the enemy away from their current positioning (which has huge potential). However, The way she builds her EMP has been deemed a little unbalanced as she can rapidly build her ult from teammates getting her hacked healthpack. When a team works with this properly, this can result in an EMP during almost every major fight. Which isn't really fair considering this particular ultimate has almost 0 counter play potential.So during the next patch they are going to  do the following buffs in order to make her more of a dps than an ultmachine-10% spread reduction on gun (let her do a little more consistent damage)-Translocator time duration increase (Let her flanks have a little more time to them so goals can be accomplished)-hack time decreased from .8 seconds to .65 seconds, (This one concerns me a bit as far as counter play goes. Hacking things like Reinhardt's shield is a HUGE deal. Hacking that shield can win a team fight and if there's no time to counterplay the hack (stop it by turning shield) thats a 2000 health barrier gone in under a second.) Hack as it is can be devastating in the mid fight when of the enemy team is focused elsewhere so i can't say im fully behind this particular buff.-Hacked Health packs no longer give Sombra ult charge (this change is to kind of cement her more as that dps role instead of an ult machine)-Finally, Hacking Heroes now disables Passive Abilities. THIS IS THE ONE THAT CONCERNS ME (From one view point, Yeah, now you can finally deal with those pesky Genji, Pharah Flankers a little easier. On the other Hand, THIS WILL DISABLE LUCIO'S current song so no aura will be produced.)As it stands Sombra's ultimate shuts down EVERY SUPPORT ULTIMATE IN THE GAME (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MERCY, BUT THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN THE PATCH HITS BECAUSE SHE WONT BE ABLE TO FLY)Where is the counterplay to this from a Support Perspective? Support ultimates (Moria's, Mercy, Lucio, Symmetra) are disabled if they have been cast. And its already almost suicide to run Zen into Sombra, because her Ultimate, that has almost no counterplay, wipes 75% of zens health to where he can die from a Melee.From a support's Perspective PLEASE DO NOT LET HACK DISABLE PASSIVES, IT WILL COUNTER EVERY SUPPORT IN THE GAME AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

"As a Mercy main I'm super bummed because GA/AD is the only fun thing left in her kit anymore (I'm not saying she's underpowered, just that Valk is a toothpaste ult and GA/AD is the main reason why I love playing Mercy, that incredible mobility).When this buff goes through for Sombra, it will mean that if the enemy team has a competent Sombra, it's going to make playing Mercy even less rewarding. This is entirely from a player engagement perspective though, so I'm not sure what it's going to do to balance.","

I think 0.65 is too fast.   Especially since hack is stronger now.  On the ptr you are almost guaranteed to get hack off now.  I don’t feel sombra should be entitled to a hack the same way I don’t believe mercy should be entitled to a res.   .70 would be more fair. But to be fair lag on the ptr is terrible which is probably contributing to my hack never being interrupted or me never interrupting hack.  I remember the recent junkrat changes feeling terrible on the ptr but much more fluid on live so maybe that’s what is going on,"

I really like the idea of mystery heroes and having a chance to play them all but right now the only mystery in mystery heroes is how much you will stomp or be stomped. You can go all game without a healer while the other team gets double Moira or the dreaded double Mercy and they are keeping their ults charging while yours gets reset every death.this can result in some incredibly frustrating game play where it seems like the better thing to do is just leave and find another game Perhaps could there be a guarantee of your team having at least 1 tank and 1 healer,"

"I think it'd just be better if they made a 1 hero limit. Currently, if the enemy gets 2 bastions, 2 Torbs, a Rein, and Mercy, there's no real chance of you winning.

"Now that you can't suicide and change heroes, they should make it so you keep your Ult charge as you change heroes.Also, I'd consider 1 hero max too.

"Coming from someone who has over 100 hours in competitive play with Moira.   To start, every team needs (or should have) 2 healers. Simply put, a single healer cannot heal 5 people. When there are 2 healers, each healer is then effectively responsible for healing 2-3 people instead of 5 which is more manageable. Every team needs at least one main healer and while I’ve found it not to be mandatory, a defensive ult is something that is desirable. This means a team composition should consist of either Mercy/Moira/Ana + Zen/Lucio. Most people know by now Ana isn’t a good pick for a multitude of reasons that I won’t get into in this thread. This means you are effectively left with a choice of either Mercy or Moira, one of which has just been nerfed. This explains the high pick rate. Prior to the Mercy nerf, if you picked Moira people would definitely tell you to switch to Mercy. People didn’t want Moira on their team. Isn’t it interesting though that 1 month later without receiving any buffs, she is suddenly “OP”? Here’s why she’s not and the constant struggles she faces in every game:   DVA eats your orbs. Your orbs are about half of your power so a single champion alone reduces your effectiveness by that much just with a single right click. If your fade is on CD and DVA decides to pounce on you rockets-a-blazin, you are dead just like any other squishy in the game. Orisa’s shield blocks your grasp. You need the grasp to recharge your heals as they will run out fast without any recharge. You can’t just go behind the shield to get the charge as you will instantly be deleted. Winston will jump on you and cockblock you with his shield too. He usually won’t kill you if he’s jumping in alone, but he will zone you away from your team who will die without your heals. If other people are jumping in with him to target you, you’re done. Tracer deletes you in 1 clip. If Tracer isn’t deleting you, she is at the very least pre-occupying you so you aren’t healing your team. She will however eventually delete you if your team does not turn around to help. Speaking of flankers, Doomfist will also delete you in 1 hit. While he’s not as common, I’ve had plenty of games where my team could not handle an enemy Doomfist as he wrecks the entire backline. Unfortunately you are helpless against him as he can delete you but you cannot delete him. Speaking of deleting, there’s a ton of other champions who will do the deed. Hanzo will delete you in 1 hit. Widowmaker will delete you in 1 hit. Junkrat will delete you in 2 hits with random spam. Roadhog will delete you with a hook. Pretty much everything in the game will delete you actually. Even a Torb Turret will delete you if you aren’t careful of its position. Your DPS is extremely low. It’s so low that you won’t be able to kill anything that is receiving any type of healing at all. Even then, whatever you target can turn around and kill you before you kill them. She’s a support. She’s not a “duelist.” Any champion that is not in the support category can and will beat her in a fight if she engages. The only thing she’s actually good for is cleaning up low HP targets and adding supplementary damage to assist other people on your team. Your primary role is to provide healing, not be a damage dealer. But there are limitations:You cannot heal a dive comp, especially when they dive on to high ground. The best you can do is throw a healing orb at them which will bounce away into the skybox after the first thing it hits. You cannot heal people spread out. Your healing is 15m range and if you use the only movement ability you have to get closer to heal your teammate, you no longer have an escape and you will die to anything that shoots at you. Your pee is hard to aim. People will try to dodge your pee and waste your meter, even when the enemy team isn't present. Your ultimate doesn’t save anybody from enemy ults. In fact, it makes you even more susceptible yourself as you lose your ability to fade away from danger. Even a simple flashbang + headshot/hammer combo will delete you if you are too close or he is flanking. There are a myriad of other dangers that exist once you hit Q. And of course, Genji will come after you first once he gets dragonblade. You will be deleted if you don't have a Zen on your team to save you. If he's nanobladed, you will be deleted anyway. TL:DR: Moira is a support that can easily be killed by everyone and her upside has limitations as well. She is only popular because there’s only two viable choices for a main healer which your team needs, one of which was nerfed heavily.","

"In case this isn't a joke post, here's why:Placements basically have no effect on your SR. After your 10 games, you will be placed at almost exactly where you ended the previous season, give or take maybe 50 SR. Instead of ""placement matches,"" think of them as ""warm-up"" or ""pre-season"" matches.","

What was your previous season?Don't care about your rank. Play to have fun,"
						Feb 15
					",,,,,,,
"It depends on the placement matches you get matched into, and that depends on your hidden MMR which is from quickplay.So you've been playing quickplay, and the game has a MMR rating for you which is roughly where it thinks your skill level is. This is calculated so it can try to match you into even games when you play.When you do placements for the first time, your MMR is used to determine what level of game you get matched into initially. So having gold medals means you outperformed your team on those stats, but if your team are at 600 SR average then your SR will end up slightly above theirs.That's simplifying it a bit, and there's a fair amount of guesswork involved because I don't think Blizzard has ever officially confirmed it, but generally speaking this seems to be the community consensus.Don't feel bad about your rank though, the first season I ever played on my main account I ranked in Silver, not too much SR away from you. I'm now at 2800 SR. It's possible to climb, just work on getting better. Let's face it, most of the fun of competitive is the process of getting better.","

"you're placed based on personal performance vs everyone else playing those heroes, you're also ranked heavily on your hidden MMR, which may be low. Silvers and golds dont necessarily guarantee you're gonna rank high, gold and silver is just your performance against your team , not against everyone. Also some tanks like Dva its expected you get gold/silver elims. It sucks you got ranked where you did, but you can climb, Ive taken two accounts to plat, one from low gold, one from high silver. Just put in the practice and you'll see improvement!","
						Feb 15
					",,,,,,,
"Placements don't actually affect your rating much, it's just a fine tuning thing.All those games you played and did well in would have been against other people of a similar MMR.For example, I've never played comp until season 7.  But before then, I would occasionally look at the SRs of people in my Recent Players and found that I was often matched with people between 2500 and 3000 SR. Sure enough, once I actually did my first placements ever with 5 wins, 1 draw, 4 losses, I was put as I believe 2736, exactly where I expected to be.","

"Dear Overwatch Team, I know it's highly unlikely that you'll ever see this forum, but I have an Idea about how to solve the issue with lost players in competitive matches. (hang tight, this is a long post)I had just played an Assault competitive match in which my team was soundly defeated (wrecked). However, in the second round of the match, there is always a chance to force the game into a draw. But my teammates must have been pissed about the fact that we didn't even reach the first point (we were attacking first) because, by the time the second round had started, they had all left. I was the last man standing.The opposing team was sympathetic about my misfortune, but they still kicked my butt as I at least attempted to stand my ground. It wasn't until the endgame stats had popped up that it hit me. What if you gave players the choice to jump into a competitive match mid-game?Now I know what you're thinking (hopefully), but I believe it could work (hopefully). I propose, that you add the option to be able to join competitive games. You would give players a preference to either search for a Competitive game, or volunteer as a fill-in for those games that have people leave. To hopefully prevent players who simply jump in to get easy rank points from joining the game, players who volunteer as fill-ins will not be rewarded with Rank Points like a regular competitive game. Instead, they will be rewarded with the competitive points used to get the golden skins for weapons. To make the Idea of being a ""Fill-in"" sweeter, you would give a bit more competitive points than the usual amount when fill-in's help competitors win games.To make sure players don't join the games simply to throw them, every loss results in the player losing half or less the number of Rank points regular competitors lose. But fill-ins will still get at least Some competitive points for volunteering. Basically: If fill-ins win, they get extra Competitive points to spend on their next gold gun.If they lose, then they lose a few their Rank points, but still get a few Competitive points as a reward for volunteering.In order to be a Fill-in, players will have to complete their placement matches and get a Rank.Players who volunteer as a fill-in will usually be placed with games containing competitors of similar rank, except for those times in which similarly ranked games needing fill-ins are non-existent. Now, there are a few exploits in this Idea.Problem: Those pesky smurfs could possibly volunteer as fill-ins, and help lesser-ranked competitors win games. Resulting in a vast amount of competitive points for them, an easy win for fellow teammates, and screwing over the opposing competitors.Possible Solution: you could try an make it more appealing to be at a higher Rank when players fill in by adjusting the number of competitive Points rewarded based on their personal rank and the estimated rank of the games they join. (higher ranked fill-in players joining lower ranked matches earn fewer points; lower ranked players joining higher ranked games earn more points)Problem: Smurfs could party up and join lesser ranked games and proceed to completely annihilate opposing lesser skilled competitors.Possible solution: Deny parties as fill-ins, have the option be solo-queue only....those are the only exploits I can see right now, but come on! I want to say goodbye to lost competitive games due to lost players.Doesn't anyone else?","

"DPS really can't carry either.Widowmaker only has 200 HP. Doesn't matter how good your aim is if the enemy widowmaker has an orisa barrier in front of her and you don't. You're still dead eventually.The difference is DPS heroes are punished more for lacking mechanical skill. Whereas tanks and supports are punished more for lacking game sense and awareness. In a sense a team of 6 can have the exact same mechanical skills, game sense, and awareness, and the DPS will always underperform compared to the other two roles. The DPS have to have outstanding mechanics to match the supports' outstanding awareness and the tanks' outstanding game sense. If the tanks and supports are actually braindead, and the enemy's tanks and supports aren't. That's GG. There are times when I have to swap off DPS and show my teammates how to support. Or swap off support and show my teammates how to tank. Not saying that doesn't happen, tanks and supports can be the problem. But it's much more common to get underperforming DPS than underperforming supports and tanks because of that mechanical difference.","

"02/16/2018 02:34 PMPosted by SquidbarrelCan you carry as Tank - Support or not?yes and no.. The game dosn't really allow for a pure carry role when you are near your correct over all SR/MMR. No mater what your role it's going to be possible for a decent team to shut down that ""carry"" level player with better team work. Unless you're playing on say an alt etc a few tier below your current skill set.So what really passes for a carry with your average player is can you impact the game enough to put your team on the edge of winning? Like no mater how cruddy the team can you by you over all game play get them 90% of the way to a win. Now you might still fail as a team but over time a player with more impact in game will win more games. the tricky part about this for tank and support players, is you will get less shots at huge game turning carry level play than a DPS player will get. It's what makes it a bit harder to get your team to the edge of winning any given game if you're support or tank. Tanks and supports also suffer more when the team comp is cruddy. All of that makes it a bit harder.","

"D.Va's added missiles and reduced Matrix time shifted her playstyle focus away from being a burst damage defender who occasionally hunted down low-health runners or out of position opponents. Now D.Va spends less of her time burst shielding her teammates and herself and instead is more of a front-line space maker who dives in and out the barrier granted by her team's shield tank and bursts down low-health, lone, or poorly positioned opponents much more often.Any D.Va that charges in attempting ""the D.Va combo"" (boosters+missiles+guns+melee) greatly imperils herself should she mess up her timing or her intended target sidesteps the missiles or melee attack since she just blew all her cooldowns minus her measly Defense Matrix and lacks immediate escape. The counter window for her doing this is larger now than was pre-rework. Once D.Va stops by meleeing or ends her booster flight, she must wait 5 seconds before she can boost out. She can shoot back, without the protection of her matrix, or use her matrix without dealing damage, but only for up to 2 seconds. This leaves her open with a 3-second downtime with no abilities whatsoever. Previously, D.Va would charge in and shoot, but if she realized she made a mistake, she had up to 4 seconds of matrix to guard her front with while waiting on her 5-second boosters to be ready again, or a 1-second downtime where she would be easily punished.So again, comparing boost+flee D.Va gameplay: old D.Va had a minimum 1-second vulnerability window. New D.Va has a minimum 3-second vulnerability window. Old D.Va gameplay focused on either a ""follow and assist"" mentality (e.g. diving with Winston) or a ""poke, defend, and flee"" mentality. New D.Va gameplay also works with follow and assist, but ""poking"" now must be played riskier and focuses on boosting in, either making chaos for her team or attempt killing something under 200 hp and preferably away from protection, and then escaping back behind her team's shield. Old D.Va had a harder time securing kills on her own but was played safer. New D.Va can secure kills more easily, but it now comes at a cost of having a greater risk of failing. Old D.Va could use her her Defense Matrix more freely to protect her teammates in more situations. New D.Va's defense Matrix is so short, she mostly uses selfishly it to protect herself. Old D.Va had a hard time as the team's solo tank, but could wing it when played very well. New D.Va needs a barrier granted by another shield tank to play around or she's toast against all but the most uncoordinated opponents. In that sense, new D.Va feels more versatile and powerful, but is more limited in the team compositions she is effective in.","

"How exactly does matchmaking work in Quickplay/Arcade?

I've been in games with bronze players queued against master players. The master/gm players noticeably out skill the rest of the players on both teams. I'm not talking a little, I'm talking a complete stomp.I know quickplay/arcade use different matchmaking but it seems entirely unfair to see a bronze/silver player vs a diamond/masters in the same match. This isn't only one match, I've been looking at the ranks nearly every game to see how/why the matchmaker is doing what its doing.tldr;If you are a master or grand master in comp, how is it possible that they are queued with/against me in quickplay/arcade?

Only custom.  In all other modes the game will try to match you with other players at roughly the same skill level.Note that different modes have different MMRs.  So a GM comp player might be a bronze QP and a platinum DM.,"

"Yes, but like your account stats it takes snapshots periodically to update the PTR account close to your live account, so it will be pretty close to your current hidden MMRs for all game modes.","

"Another event, another time my favourite arcade mode (Elimination 3v3) is gone. I really dislike the ""6v6 No limits"" or ""Mayhem"" (and please don't get me started in ""Mystery Heroes""); it's really tedious and cheese-intensive for me. Barring that the intention behind this move is to make the farming of three loot boxes not so appealing (I doubt it is the case), I don't understand why Arcade can't hold more modes, or all of them.So my suggestion is that, more of a petition: Please allow all the game modes in Arcade, at any time. Put the spotlight on the event exclusive ones like Lúcio-Ball or Capture the Flag Competitive, but don't hide the ones that people enjoy in exchange for others that they outright won't play.We have 35 million players, I'm sure we all know that options that keep everybody happy won't split the playerbase in a substantial way.Thanks in advance.","

"Have Torb buffs center around his capability of aiming his gunshots and you get a buff that does not affect lower level play, if thats what they are so afraid of.

No more Genjis and Tracers 1v2 crushing Torb players in higher rank matches, nothing changes in lower level matches since lower level players can't aim.See?

But for 15 seconds. If you worked together as a team you can easily kill the flag bearer with only 60 heals per second but a sound barrier or trans, even though a shorter time, is harder to penetrate. Moira also puts out a lot of healing on the flag bearer but also damages people chasing the flag bearer. Mercy's ult is currently the weakest support ult in the game overall and if Blizzard keep nerfing her they might as well remove her wings and make her as immobile as Ana, make her ult rez herself but just die again straight on the spot because of how immobile she would be.","

"I haven't been able to find a list of all the heroes and what you can do in response to their ultimate ability so I decided to make a list.  Each ultimate has been broken down by shutdown (flat out stops the ultimate), diminish (doesn't stop the ultimate, but negates at least some aspect of it), and end (stops ultimate once started).  The reason there is shutdown and end is for ultimate abilities that have a ""casting period"" and the ultimate effect itself.  Ultimate abilities without end have no ""casting"" period and happen instantaneously.  Some abilities I'm unsure if they have a tiny ""casting"" period or not, like Bastion's or Tracer's in which they could be hacked, for example.  I know from personal experience Mei's can be interrupted in the time between it leaving her hand and hitting the ground.Status is any loss of control ability (stun, sleep, pin, frozen, hooked) but not control impairing abilities (Junkrat trap, Mei's slow if not frozen, Zarya ultimate).  Hack is separate as there seem to be at least a few instances in which a hack and the listed status effects don't work the same way on someone's ultimate.The other terms used are matrix (D.Va's defense matrix), reflect (Genji ability), invulnerability (Mei Cryo Freeze, Reaper Wraith Form, Zenyatta Transcendence, Moira Fade, Mercy's resurrection target), shield (Reinhardt shield, Winston bubble, Zarya bubble, Mei wall, Orisa shield).  I'm unaware of any ultimate abilities other than Moira's that interact with a Mei wall differently than with a tank shield, save for ones like Genji or Winston which they can simply walk around the wall like any other cover.Unless specifically noted cover negates all offensive ultimates.  Zarya's still pulls through walls and I have died to Pharah's with a floor between us (may have been a bug, not sure).  Also, unless specified otherwise, all damaging abilities are diminished by damage reducing effects (Nano boost, Fortify, Configuration: Tank, and Take a Breather).OFFENSEDoomfist:Shutdown - NoneDiminish - Shields, invulnerability,End - NoneGenji:Shutdown - Eliminate, hackDiminish - StatusEnd - Elimination, hackMcCree:Shutdown - Eliminate, hack, statusDiminish - Shields, invulnerability, reflect, matrixNOTE: Does not appear to take damage reduction into account, or healing received after initial lock on.

"For the first time after reading your post I agree with 100% of what you are saying.Here is my issue, and what I feel is an issue many others are facing.If Blizzard completely guts another support, after gutting every other support save Zenyatta, I will lose people to play with.I am a tank player. We require supports to be effective. If everyone I know, who plays supports, will stop playing Overwatch if Moira gets nerfed, then I am against Moira getting nerfed. I don't care why. I don't care if the pro META is 5 tanks and Moira. I do not want to see 4-5 of my friends stop caring about a game when the devs clearly don't care about them.A Moira nerf will be bad on the game simply because of principle. I do not like it, but that's how it is now. Blizzard has nerfed every support in the game. Zenyatta has been buffed, but his buff was for one instance concerning Widowmaker and body shots on a hero with zero mobility. Beyond that Zenyatta has never been a true top tier support. Always playing second fiddle to Ana, Mercy, and Lucio.I guarantee if Moira is nerfed, deserved or not, the player count will drop dramatically. Blizzard has no one to blame but themselves at this point.","

Lucio feels lackluster and only as a secondary healer. Zen works if you've got good aim. Moira is the only support that feels fun and impactful. Nerfing her would be sending the message that supports are not valued heroes in Blizzard's eyes.

"I wonder how Doomfist would do if he had lower damage and couldn't oneshot but had somewhere around 400 HP, focusing more on disrupting the enemy front line with his CC. In essence a squishier, smaller Primal Winston.With all the knockbacks and knockups built into his kit he'd probably excel at that, and with more than 250 HP he might be able to initiate a fight without being extremely reliant on a Zarya bubble.In his current state he is a 250 HP melee hero with a rather massive hitbox, even bigger than McCree, and the list of his counters is quite long. I believe his biggest problems are also tied to his survivability, and making him an off-tank might solve that issue.On an unrelated note, it's quite ironic how they show him in his cinematic as this towering indestructible monster that can tank 10 full clips from Genji and Tracer, and then he's the complete opposite in-game.","

Just curious as to some thoughts people had for a new hero. Played out as this forum concept may be I believe it's always like to see what you all think this game is lacking. I'd personally like to see long range tank to hopefully coax some people away from dps roles & one tricking. Something that can really crank out dps over a long distance perhaps use deflection as a damage absorption toolkit? I envision some sort of grav defense matrix grenade with an effect similar to orisa shield but duration based. Deflection ensures players cannot cross and walk out like dummies in front without just plain ol' suicide. Same result as walking in front of rein shield but perhaps people might actually stay behind it.,"

Just me saying that it would be cool if the characters who needed love were basically buffed so they could contend with the top characters roughly evenly. Again: Best characters are left alone. The rest are buffed to balance with them. I call it balancing upward. Is that negative to people? The first comment was someone telling me they are glad I am not on the balance team. The next from that person was saying I show favoritism. This place is nuts. I can’t have a single conversation with anyone here. I’m out. Good luck with your bickering.,"

"SombraEMPNo longer blocked by small objects (e.g. sign posts)HackNo longer gains ultimate charge from health pack healingCast time reduced from 0.8 seconds to 0.65 secondsNow disables the following abilities:Genji—Cyber-agility (cant doubble jump)Hanzo—Wall Climb Pharah—Hover Jets (if get hacked in air will fall down)Lúcio—Healing Boost and Speed Boost (turns off current song entirely), Wall Ride (can only fire)Mercy—Angelic Descent (will fall from air if hacked even if holding the air same as phara)Machine PistolMachine Pistol spread reduced from 3 to 2.7 OpportunistNow activates when enemies’ health bars are at less than 100%, up from 50% health (sombra vision can now see every target that have lost health.)TranslocatorDuration increased from 15 seconds to 20 secondsDeveloper Comment: The goal of these changes for Sombra is to remove the necessity for her teammates to take damage and heal themselves with her hacked heath packs to try to get her ultimate charged up quickly. Her ultimate will now come up less often, but there are more abilities that are disabled by Hack so it is more effective when used. Previously, Opportunist would only activate when an enemy’s health bar dipped below 50% but now the passive will reveal all damaged enemies which should help Sombra identify targets to pick off. Overall these changes should make her more effective and less reliant on her ultimate.I have earlyer complain that they nerf more then buff, but now it seems like going to right directsion when giveing 5 extra sec on her translocator, that gives sombra time to actully reload and fire some more bullet before escapeing. and that means she can regen more ulti charge, and that will balance the nerf.Also I manage to get into PTR and try her, i cant say that i felt any diffrent with those spread changes, the gun feels the same. but the hack and translocator makes a valid balance for the healthpack nerf.overall i think all those changes on sombra is neither buff or nerf, it's more of a change. she is more usefull in a way and less empbot.if Blizzard plans to change more stuff on her i recomend  them to be minimum changes so she dont end up OP, even tho i would like it since im a sombra main but i think overall the game. never fun with a overpowerd hero.","

The reduction to her spread will do wonders for her and allow her to be more effective at cleaning up kills and actually duelling enemiesHack and EMP being stronger by disabling the abilities shown above as well as Hack being faster and EMP going through signposts are more great changes and will allow Sombra to be more effectiveFinally, the Translocator changes don't seem too big but will easily allow her to be more useful in a fight","

The fact that her healing economy is tied to her ability to actively attack/engage the enemy is a perfect concept for a support hero.

Not just managing her healing economy, but also being sustainable during the mid and late fight makes her extremely fun to play.

They DO have an argument.Most of it is 1) Shes a main healer alongside Mercy and Ana. 1 out of the 3 havent been nerfed while the other 2 is boring to play and the other is UP.2) She has no utility outside of damage and healing to the team. Every other support has utility, Mercy has damage boost mobility, Zen has damage and discord, Lucio has speed boost, Symmetra has turrets and her ult, Ana has grenade (does anti-heal and burst heal) with sleep dart. She has fade for herself and damage/heal orb and spray healing. Thats it.3) She has counters and it is tanks and burst damage heroes.4) 50 DPS, the lowest in the game. Winston is even higher.5) Orbs can be countered by D.va or grouping up or just disengaging from the orb.6) Though her ult charges fast, it doesnt do as much damage as it does but its mostly useful for pushing or sustaining heals for her team for a push.A lot of counter arguments bring do bring up her weakspots, what shes good at and what she isnt. Saying they dont have an argument is saying you dont bother reading or listening to the other side of the argument at all.","

So I was roaming around the forums reading about DPI and Sensitivity other people use and stuff and was rather surprised. I myself use 1600 DPI and 8-9 sens. in game and thought that most people have it. But I keep seeing that people with same DPI use something like 2-5 sens. in game so I decided to check it out since my aim isnt good and I thought maybe low sens will help a little at least. But I just dont get it how people play on such a low sensitivity? I don't really have that much desk space so with sens like 3 or 4 I just cant simply do a proper 360 or even 180 without lifting my mouse. What sensitivity and DPI do you guys use?,"

"Lower sensitivity helps with better tracking. However, you can't just immediately deduct your sens in half and expect results.If you want to reduce it, Do it slowly. My DPI is 800 so i reduce by 0.5 . Yours is 1600 so you can reduce by one. See how it feels. But in the end, it's all preference. People get used to different senses. We got Babybay with 1000 DPI and 9 sens.We got Ryujehong with 1000 DPI and 1.13 Sens. It depends on how you feel. Don't worry about the numbers that much. But if you can't track properly, it's best if you slowly reduce it.","

it has to depend on your mousepad/how much space you have to move around. i used to play on 17.34 sens with a generic mouse with no dpi settings. i believe i have a medium sized mousepad and i now play on 1600 and 3.16 (41 scope) and my aim is way better than it used to be (regardless of what my trash rank tells you i just did placements for the first time in several seasons and havent had time for climbing). when i get good fps i almost always have 70+% accuracy with ana.,"

"If I understand correctly, high DPI/Low sens allows for a much easier window in terms of tracking.  Think of it like moving the mouse 1 inch doing a 180 (higher sense) VS like 45 degrees (lower). In theory, the lower sens player will be able to track targets on screen more consistently ( good for heroes like Zarya or Soldier who have sustained fire). The higher sens will be a bit better for players who are proficient at flick shots (McCree and Widow) because they'll be able to snap over larger distances, assiming their numbers are calibrated so that they won't overshoot on their movements all the time. It also depends on space. I myself don't have room on my desk for a triple-wide mousepad, so arm-aim is out for the most part. I do alright using like 6sens 1600 DPI on a larger-ish mousepad, mostly with wrist movement. My tracking is a bit better, but I can't do snap-180s anymore, so there is a LOT of give and take. I hope at least some of that helps.","

"I made a thread about this earlier today.I recently moved to PC and I've been trying to dial in my sensitivity.From what I've been reading about it, it sounds like the in-game sensitivity is just a modifier for your dpi.  I think in a perfect world you would dial in your dpi to exactly what you want it to be and not have to use the in-game one at all.  But since most mice don't allow you to dial in the exact dpi or maybe you have a cheap walmart mouse, the in-game sensitivity allows you to fine tune it.  The downside would be pixel skipping.I would take this with a grain of salt.  It's just what I've gathered and came up with after googling it all day.I'm currently using 3200 and 1.  It's the same as 800 and 4 but according to this site (https://pyrolistical.github.io/overwatch-dpi-tool/) there would be no pixel skipping at anything above 1080p.  This is kinda what makes me believe that dpi is your primary sensitivity and the in game one is just used to fine tune.","

"1) You get used to it. I used to play at a very high sensitivity and now play at a very low one.2) There's nothing wrong with sometimes having to lift your mouse. You don't need to do 360s either, just 180s and it's fine that being wild to do.3) At as low as 1800 dpi (for Razer mice, 2100 for other) even with the best sensor (3360+) smoothing comes into play, or from what I gather a delay for the motion of your cursor to be smoothed. So you do not want to be exceeding 2000 dpi. I've heard of jitter as well, perhaps they both come together (go figure). Furthermore, recently I've been reading some suggestions that there may be some mouse performance improvement to play at an even lower dpi- 800 being what many fps pros play at, even OW ones. So recently I went down to 800 from 1600 and doubled my in-game sens. That still keeps me on the border for pixel skipping with most heroes but as soon as I go to a higher than 1920x1080 resolution, especially if I go to 4k, pixel skipping will occur. At this point I'm ok with that. Seems most pros and highly ranked streamers don't mind and their performance is good.","

"Hey,I have played with a high sensitivity in the past, but then changed to a much lower sens. Currently, I'm using 1000 DPI and 3.25 ingame sens, and my accuracy has been improved since then easily by 50%~.A friend of mine didn't believe me, he didn't think it could work either. But I told him he should try it at least for a day or two. Now his accuracy has improved dramatically too. Don't get me wrong though. It doesn't mean it's impossible to work with high sens. There are some pro's who use a very high sens, but I don't think it's optimal, at least if you're playing heroes where pixel perfect aim is required.BTW., I didn't just randomly came up with my sens. Instead, I used a method to test which sens would be optimal for tracking. It just happened naturally that I went down A LOT (like 5 times slower than I was before).I used the method of following video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRFWLJazYYo&t=3sIt takes time and it's boring. BUT, I can honestly say that it was really worth it for me. I encourage you to try it out and see for yourself. Maybe you do well with higher sens anyway. But don't rush it, otherwise it won't work.","

"1600 DPI, 6-8 (depending on hero) sensitivity. Higher for Winston or Reinhardt, lower for D.Va or Ana for example.Can't really change my DPI since I play Osu with that DPI and I'm so used to my DPI that it would take quite a while to get used to a different one and.. I've made a good bit of progress even though I've only really played it for 3-4 days, I'm up to 3.5 stars, so that DPI just seems to really work for me.Yes, yes, ""just switch it when you play OW."" I would but my mouse sometimes stays on default settings, sometimes it uses my own, and they're obviously different which.. makes things difficult. The sniper button with my settings is like, 8x the default 400 DPI for example, being 3200 for me.","

"I'm at 1800 DPI and 2.3 sensitivity. I've been lower and I've been much higher, but now any higher feels very weird to me.It has helped my aim significantly since lowering it, but it does take some time to get used to being able to 180. Having a large mousepad and using your whole arm to aim helps.If you want to try it out, get a mousepad the size of the Steelseries QCK+ (It's huge so make sure you have room for it) and download Aim Hero on steam or something. Set the FOV in Aim Hero to 71 (equivalent to 103 in OW) and match your OW sensitivity then start hitting the targets.It won't make you better at OW mechanically (in my opinion), but it is perfect for getting used to a new mouse sensitivity and increasing your general dexterity with a mouse.That said if you are happy with the settings you are using, just stick with them.","

"Set your sens gradually lower, don't make a sudden, steep drop.Play for a few hours with the new one so you'll get adjusted.I went from 15/1600 through 10, 4 and ended up at 3.It's much better this way.","

"I haven't seen the term eDPI, which is basically DPI x Sensitivity. For reference, I used to play at approx. 8000 eDPI (800 dpi, 10 sens), now I play at 4000 eDPI (800 dpi, 5 sens).It all depends on where you feel comfortable. One of the best OW players right now, Ryujehong uses very very low eDPI (roughly 1200 eDPI, I believe), while people like Shadowburn, or other Genji mains often use 6-8000 eDPI. The standard eDPI seems to be around the 4000 mark.I would personally lower your eDPI to around maybe 8000 and see how comfortable you are coming from around 13k eDPI. I wouldn't go higher than 8000 because a) its actually not good for your wrist to only aim using wrist movements, and b) the ultimate goal is motor learning or muscle memory as most people call it. Basically at the end you want to be able to turn every degree of 360° fast without having to think about it or slow down your movement to adjust your aim. And this is proven to be easier to do with whole arm movements with lower eDPI as you use bigger muscles which improves your motor learning.","

Also quad tank would probably kick in even more effective than ever. What I'm trying to say is that if you're a tank or support main Blizzard probably isn't gonna help your situation ever.

If you let yourself get angry or stressed or anxious AT ALL you will FAIL. Being on tilt will always cause you to play worse.If you realize you're on tilt, immediately stop playing. Turn the computer off, get up, go outside. Don't keep playing on tilt because you'll just lose and get more tilted.If you're staying positive and, more importantly, making sure your teammates are staying positive, you will win more games.

"I'm an older gamer, I don't have those high twitch snappy reflexes I used to have. I'm 100% happy there are heroes like Reinhardt, Winston, Moira, and Mercy in the game. I'm happy that I can still compete at a decent rank (Plat) playing these heroes. And you know something. There are a lot of gamers who are getting older and these kind of games (Overwatch) are a godsend to us. We still love gaming, we still have exceptional game sense, and we still enjoy competition, we simply lack those MLG reflexes. Look at the tank roster, those are all amazing heroes that take exceptional game sense in order to take space, secure kills, and defend the  support/backline. The fact that Overwatch had a place for a gamer like me is why I was attracted to it in the first place. This game would not have sold as well as it did if it didn't take into account all demographics of gamers. So before you are ready to toss me aside as a gamer, just know I have booped, peeled, body blocked, hooked, bubbled, DM'd, and shielded all of you DPS and Support players. Know that I have pushed you up with my shields, shot called targets with Winston, Know that I set you up to get that awesome quintuple kill with my Zarya ult/Reinhardt ult. I'll still be there to compliment those great plays you make, but if you don't want to return the favor because you think ""we"" play ""no skill heroes"" that counter your ""skilled"" hero, then I don't know what to say.

"01/26/2018 04:51 PMPosted by RichCI'm an older gamer, I don't have those high twitch snappy reflexes I used to have. I'm 100% happy there are heroes like Reinhardt, Winston, and Mercy in the game. I'm happy that I can still compete at a decent rank (Plat) playing these heroes. And you know something. There are a lot of gamers who are getting older and these kind of games (Overwatch) are a godsend to us. We still love gaming, we still have exceptional game sense, and we still enjoy competition, we simply lack those MLG reflexes. Look at the tank roster, those are all amazing heroes that take exceptional game sense in order to take space, secure kills, and defend the  support/backline. The fact that Overwatch had a place for a gamer like me is why I was attracted to it in the first place. This game would not have sold as well as it did if it didn't take into account all demographics of gamers. So before you are ready to toss me aside as a gamer, just know I have booped, peeled, body blocked, hooked, bubbled, DM'd, and shielded all of you DPS and Support players. Know that I have pushed you up with my shields, shot called targets with Winston, Know that I set you up to get that awesome quintuple kill with my Zarya ult/Reinhardt ult. I'll still be there to compliment those great plays you make, but if you don't want to return the favor because you think ""we"" play ""no skill heroes"" that counter your ""skilled"" hero, then I don't know what to say. No... Check that.. I do know what to say. You disappoint me.This thread is in an unashamed response to this thread:https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760877793Everything i wanted to say but couldn't. thank you.","

You telling me snapping my shield around to juke a RIPTIRE to block it isn't skill? You telling me that baiting out a Reinhardt Earthshatter to block it isn't skill? You telling me that Mercy player with exceptional positioning to follow in behind a dive but zip out and take cover to avoid a widow bullet isn't skill?

Reinhardt is a perfect captain hero role in this game. I support you my brother.

"Edit: Don’t bother commenting if you won’t read the whole way through. My first two paragraphs don’t explain the rest of the paragraphs...Nerf Moira? Nerf Genji? Nerf Tracer? Why would you want those heroes to fall when playing them feels so good? Isn’t that the point. To make great characters? Here’s the thing. D.Va, Winston, Genji(other than the one deflect problem) Moira and Tracer all feel great. Mercy before this last patch was overkill, but she deserves better than what she has. So do the rest of the heroes. Sombra looks like she might be heading towards balance with the heroes mentioned above. I’m excited for that. I have no idea why most of you want awesome characters that you don’t play to take a fall when it would be better for everyone if your own mains were reinforced to maintain a balanced presence. The bickering and moaning is so pointless. Moira is fine. Tracer is fine. D.Va is fine. Someone earlier said Doomfist is OP. I coughed my burritos out of my nostrils. No, Doomfist isn’t, but I hope he ends up where Moira and D.Va are, not the other way around. I hope someone can switch off D.Va one day to play Torbjorn and his team feel it’s okay. I know that’s a bad example because D.Va and Torbjorn fill two different roles, but you get it. Buff more where needed. Nerf less in general. Pray Mercy never unleashes her true power again.","

The word “balance” means they tangle with the other heroes without breaking anything. That’s why we have that word...right? I know that the forum is pretty negative but I assure you I do not favor any hero in particular. I don’t want Moira and D.Va to be more powerful and have higher pick rates. I’m just saying I’d rather have the rest of the cast buffed up to balance out(balance being key)with them than have D.Va and Moira fall. Yes, it’s more time and work, but it’s an overall better decision in the long run, provided it can work out that way.And your insult. It provided nothing to the discussion. It’s just...an insult from some random person on the internet. Like...why?","

Is there any way we can get the color changed to green for allies?

						Feb 9
					",,,,,,,
Also Genji's ally color is green so I think it would fit.,"
							 (Edited)
",,,,,,,
"Notice that Genji's dragonblade has a light blue color to it and has new voice lines for both friendly and hostile i think. the skin itself is cool just like the others, and it really makes you question why the other skins don't have their own special effects as well. You can see a lot of the changes they made to characters and their skins especially in Halloween Terror.This event is honestly a really special one. The skins themself are really good, but so are ones from other events. For this event, they make certain decisions with some skins that you wouldn't see in any other event. I'm sure that the design and the work put in to make these are supposed to compensate for those small extra things.On the other side though:     You know they have made plenty of custom voice lines for skins and some with their own unique sounds. For example, Tracer's Jingle skin makes the sound of bells when blinking, and some puns after a kill like ""I think I heard some ""slay"" bells!""     I can probably name a couple from every event except uprising since that event was more about the characters' backgrounds, not really making them something that they aren't in other events.     Summer Games gave Mercy's Winged Victory a new resurrect voice line,as well as mccree's lifeguard outfit got flashbangs turned into water bottles i think? And soldier had plenty of easter eggs and summer themed items hidden in his Biotic Field, Heavy Pulse Rifle and i think a previous voiceline he had that was for his ultimate: ""Tactical sunglasses activated!""This has existed even before the reappearance of events, but some might have came later in an event sometimes I'm pretty sure. You also have Mercy's Witch skin having the voicelines ""My servants never die!"" and ""I'm on fire! But this witch doesn't burn."" The wings are also changed up a bit to have slightly different coloring and are cut-out a bit...Junkrat's Dr Junkenstein skin one for his riptire....and of course the datamined voice lines that also never hit heroes...Some did come to heroes too, and they got removed afterwise! I think this was shown in Grillmaster: 76's ult and i think the voice line got removed for that... then Zenyatta's Cultist skin which had i believe ""Experience Nothingness."" and he used to say ""Zenyatta is everywhere,"" on a hero change. It got reworked afterwards.It showed up more between the repeated appearances of the Summer Games and Halloween Terror, but after that the small special effects and voice lines kind of died off.I basically expected all those special effects on the Overwatch Anniversary since it was such a special event to everyone, and there were so many skins too!I'll say this: The skins are still amazing, but it really does make me wonder what they're doing with the rest of the time they have on their hands.I'll make an example out of Mercy since I've talked about her a bit: Maybe you can change the yellow light that spawns on resurrecting someone to a red light, with the Chinese symbol of Life attached to it. That would be a start.As mentioned before, the Zarya beam should honestly be green. You can literally see the skins revolve around these certain colors, but they still have the ordinary visual effects in game. You see: You have basically more than 6 skins for all the other events each since anniversary (I think), then you have the epic skins which seem to be discontinued for events. They were in the cosmetic update though, and i'm not gonna count the OWL skins. I like that, but they've been able to launch a whole bunch of legendary skins AND some epic skins some with their own cool effects like Reaper's skin from Winter Wonderland. That probably should have been legendary, and Mei's skin should have been turned to epic if anything.Now I shouldn't expect too much from Blizzard because they've probably been working on other events like Uprising, Anniversary and the previous Cosmetic Update but a little more dedication for this event would be nice just like Hanzo from Winter Wonderland. You even have the victory poses Sombra and Bastion had from the last event that never even made it to the game until after the actual event where they were made for. Then you have it so for every new hero that enters the game, They now need a sitting emote, a dance if they come before anniversary, a laughing emote, and now their own section of sprays, which are small but important things to a hero. Let's not forget The Overwatch League skins they'll need, and after seeing the results of the cosmetics in this new update, I feel like the events are just going to get worse and that trend will continue.Come on, hero balancing and reported players too? I would get upset trying to manage all this and that's probably why i'll be thankful for anything we get at an event at this point.This is just my take on it, and seriously I would enjoy it a lot more if every legendary skin had their own special thing about it like many other basic legendary ones that have been in the game. Some are just super special and come with the effects like Rime and Avalanche Sombra and Bastion had on December. This is unrelated, but since we brought up the topic on cosmetics: Can we all agree that Reaper could feel more awesome to play if his guns started to flow with energy (and it would increase) the more hero damage he dealt for a certain time though? It could also possibly be a decent indicator of how much you're actually getting off with him. Hmm.. a small visual effect that represents Reaper well as a ""Soul Hunter"" I call him and shows just how much you're doing with him.. Kind of like Symmetra's gun a little bit. They also tried representing him and his obsession with death by giving him a new skin from Halloween Terror as Vampire and they actually made it so only his R.I.P. Victory Pose dropped from loot boxes since it describes his character and all the others you had to buy... I want to feel closely related to a hero (not specifically Reaper, just bringing up him as an example) but I don't want to throw away every other hero in the game. I honestly don't know how to feel at this point, I've been at this for way too long.But you (might) start to see a trend in the effort made to an event go down.Edit: Honestly there's no reason events couldn't be better, they're just spending a lot more time doing other stuff like CTF which is probably going to die out with the speed of matches and a competitive mode that is trying to get players on it more often when it is very clear ctf will see very little play time after the event imo. The map currently isn't usable for anything but ctf and you aren't going to be guaranteed it every match after the event. It's weird why Ayutthaya doesn't have a deathmatch mode when some maps give you access to half (or more than half) of them. Same would go for it having an elimination mode. There's a really good chance it'll be added to these modes especially when ctf isn't always around and the new map will clearly gain the least played time without that change.","

I even put up new personal highscore stats for the season I tried so hard to secure the win.The next game our team got steamrolled in 8 minutes and I lost 24SR.I tilted very hard after that.https://i.imgur.com/FqAov7B.jpg - Pic of the game if you don't believe.,"

"Ghost Reload isn't a thing.It's simply filling dead time after the reload goes through with a melee/dash/deflect.Same thing Reaper does with his melee, it takes the SAME amount of time to reload (if not longer) but allows you to put damage down immediately after it.Ghost dash is just a party-trick, it has no use in-game other than saving a few frames and looking cool.","

"As he is right now. His bugs are his biggest obstacle.

"02/14/2018 12:00 PMPosted by Geoff GoodmanThe way we have his leap working right now in our internal builds is that its a double-jump, much like his brother, but with a couple key differences. Firstly, it is mostly a horizontal leap (and its pretty fast), unlike Genji's vertical leap. Secondly, it has a small cooldown, which is necessary considering the amount of mobility it gives Hanzo now. Also, to clarify, you will leap towards the direction you are pressing, not the direction you are facing. This is the exact same control scheme we use for Tracer's blinks, so think of it like that.For his new ability called Volley, we're still iterating on it. For example, we've already changed the numbers of arrows fired from 5 to 6 and lowered the damage per arrow. Currently it lasts up to 6 seconds, and allows you to fire about 3 arrows per second (up to 6 total). Each arrow fires at ""full power"" but deals only 80 damage (instead of his normal 125). There is no charge time while in this mode, if you hold the button down you will fire the arrows in a full-auto mode. This has been really fun so far in playtests. He has a lot more options during combat now, and deciding how and when to use your Lunge ability is really interesting. You can use both ability to leap around a corner and fire a bunch of arrows into a key target, but then you're leaving yourself really open to counter attack. You can also save Lunge when you know there is an enemy Winston looking to jump on you to make a quick leap back while firing tons of arrows into him and his barrier.Both of these changes sound like they are ripped right from Sha Lin (Paladins bow wielder) as he can do a vertical leap (with the main difference being its only backwards and he goes invisible) and can rapid fire 6 arrows within around the same span of 2 seconds. I'm not complaining about these changes as I feel hanzo will be more fun now to play as and against but I just felt as I should just point that out.","

Your tears are delish.As much as I enjoy the tears,  the nerfs didnt really impact him and prevented him to be OP because they didnt touch double jump (other than the wall reset part of it) My aim is not the greatest but its never been an issue with almost every other characters in the game.  Genji and Tracer break the flow of the normal game and force players to need much higher skill at aiming than their counter part genji needs at spamming spacebar.     This is why Genji breaks the game and this is why he will continue to break the game.  His ult is also stupidly strong and the 2 second nerfs may prevent team wipes but it will not prevent his first 2-3 kills of all your squishies and maybe a tank.   Nobody else has such a strong consistent ult...except maybe zarya. So 2 weeks in the patch, people will be back at ruining games with genji in full glory..which may be a good thing because it may finally force blizz to nerf his movement.","

"Most people who hate on Genji are people who can't play high skill ceiling heroes and can't comprehend that the reason they get killed is simply because they were outplayed. And I'm not even crying about the Genji nerfs. Sure, I think they went a little too far with all three at once (I think they should give triple jump back). But I've been playing Genji on the PTR against people between 3500-4000+ MMR , and have a 62% win rating with close to 50 games played with Genji. He is definitely still useful, although certainly weaker than before and requires an adaptation in play style. His ultimate is mostly a tool to force Zenyatta ult, and maybe a couple kills. Team wipes are still possible, but much rarer.","

"My second and last option which i looked into that QP affects it now, before it was just about last comp rating and your performance in placements.Now it looks like it depends on QP mmr even if you played seasons before, for example imagine if you were 3500 last season and now you “tryharded” QP and tried your best only with your main and then played comp, it would throw you in games slightly above your rank. But if you were just messing around and trying new heores in QP it would throw you in games under your SR and that affected your result.In both cases its broken and really needs to be looked at.

"Seen it’s suggested QP helps form your MMR that equally affects competitive MMR and thus SR. Suddenly “It’s just QP” doesn’t sound so fun anymore, knowing you’re causing yourself to be kept with lower tier teammates and never climb, or you’re subjected to everyone else treating it lightly also affecting your chances at winning and in turn, your MMR, especially if filling roles, playing heroes you don’t want to or worse, not allowing the room to play your respective heroes in optimal conditions. Sounds like a damn good time.","

"I've been playing since Season 1, the following are my personal opinions on how competitive has played ever since I started at low/mid gold. Most of this will be pertaining to playing Solo.Solo comp is never a fun feeling. Even if I am winning several games in a row it's more often attributed to the enemy team having a DC, rage quitter, or just all around drama destroying their ability to play. I would honestly say 1 in every 7 or 8 games I get a real match where both teams play legit and aren't yelling at their own team. It feels great when this happens... but doesn't happen as often as Blizzard would like to think. This is what your MOST COMMON match should be like but it simply isn't. When your most commonly seen comp match is angry toxic players ruining a team or when one team has a person burping into the mic and making obnoxious noises while demanding heals, what fun are we having here? Where is the competitive nature here? Why is this the de facto NORMAL game play competitive experience? This is not something any company should be proud of. I truly hope Blizzard understands how intensely mixed bag it feels to play this game in their ""Competitive"" game mode. I feel like I have learned more about how to practice self-restraint and handle talking to children than I have at learning how to play the game at a higher level.TLDRComp in this game is utterly toxic and needs overhauls, things people have been saying since at least season 2 or 3 even. Blizzard has tweaked how SR gains and losses work, how reporting works, but this could be helped further by pushing more drastic changes that have been sorely needed, in my experience with other games.1. Solo queue separated SR from team queue like almost every other game, to include other Blizzard games. Why is OW all grouped up when the playerbase is so big? How does HOTS work fine with that model for example if OW can't try?2. Potentially role based queue so you are rated according to your chosen role.  Top 500 being an account thing and not how good someone is on one chosen hero just feels odd to me since the beginning. Also favors team queue players heavily. Separated solo top 500 players and team top 500 would also work. People like to bash the idea of roles but it would lower toxicity and help chisel to anyone how good you are with your chosen play style. You wouldn't be in a position if you hate to tank or heal for example if you just want to DPS. You wouldn't be in a position to DPS if you like to tank or heal. You will be rated FAIRLY at what you want to play and how good you are at playing it. You will not be forced to play something at your current rank that you know you are not as good at or simply do not want to play.3. Something more done to people who throw games / DC and ruin other team mates SR. They are slowly doing more about toxic players but when people DC or ragequit the entire team you are on are simply screwed over. I don't care how many people suggest this can be manipulated if they make the guy who did it take all the loss, because if someone truly wants to buy accounts just to enable throwing for the team they gonna be spending stupid amounts of money for something so stupid like that. Not to mention time to get up to whoever they play with. I'm sure they can also be reported too, meanwhile, you are not suffering from one persons toxic behaviors / incidental internet problems. Being penalized for some other players actions is mind boggling and I feel bad every time an enemy team loses due to a leaver.4. Golden guns was implemented poorly. I suggest doing something in the future where anyone can earn them from any mode and make Competitive have just special flashy character portraits or something if they must have something unique. The rank flashyness for example when someone looks at your profile pretty much already suffices. Could maybe have a permanent account marker showing your highest attained rank or a spray of some kind. I only bring this up because truly a lot of people do play comp only to place and then never play until season end to do it again. This, or they play a little bit but are inherently angry at how the toxicity works in competitive play which makes the overall game worse because they don't want to play for competitive purposes, they want to play for golden guns. They therefore trigger more easily, hurt people trying to rank up (mostly affecting lower ranking players), or simply aren't trying like others in the team are. Please try to address this by giving what they want more openly to capitalize what competitive players should be expecting in the team mates they are given on any match.5. Decay system. Ever since I got Diamond back in Season 3 I've had just about no desire to play competitive because of this FORCED attitude toward upkeeping your rank and making playing the game a chore rather than something you want to do. Only the top 500 in my opinion should be affected by rank decay, or perhaps just anyone over 4000 rating in general. I lost 166 points when I was in Season 3 as a military deployed member and had absolutely no desire to do anything up until this very season to finally push to Master. Nothing is more demoralizing than losing your rating to nothing, nothing at all. Your time just being thrown out and wasted and unappreciated. My friends mostly left that I group played with due to this, we just didn't want to get together and act like this is a designated raid time from an MMO kind of mentality where we gotta play X and Y days to upkeep it. You basically want us to put life on hold. so again, only the people truly dedicated to getting and obtaining top 500 should be decaying because they should be working to earn, upkeep, and deserve it. Anyone else shouldn't be forced to play at that level of play, in my opinion. Smurfs wouldn't be an issue, as was originally the cause of this decay system, because they would be affected by the top 500 rank decay. Infact, more seems to be needed to ensure people with multiple accounts aren't holding top 500 still to this day, so you know already that this rank decay system isn't working as intended regardless.Thanks if you have read this far, I just wanted to make this post fundamentally different than most players who get excited about ranking up and saying how amazing it felt / what anyone can try to up their game like they may have done to obtain higher rankings. I wanted to instead provide the ENDURANCE it took and PATIENCE through the suffering and misery that is the system instead. I truly love this game but am fundamentally confused why the game is in such a limbo state of affairs when it comes to the overall enjoyment factor and what has been done to make things more fair, less toxic, and more accessible for players.","

I was in a match for example yesterday where 4 of the 6 players were support mains. Is this fair since they have to play outside of their preferred hero class? The enemy team has to be in an equally unfair position for this to be considered ok such as 4 of the 6 players being tank mains so some of them have to also play outside of their norm and preferred position. *I feel like an odd ball TBH that is ok playing any role. This is the way the game was supposed to, in theory, be made for as the devs declare. Switching heroes as they are needed except the majority of the player base does not want to do this. They want to play one specific role generally, let alone 1-2 heroes they specialize in. Competitive play does not support this currently, even though this has been the main numero uno issue to toxicity in my experience the game suffers from. If anyone can recall the game was originally ""designed"" with the mindset of having duplicate heroes like 3 Zarya and 3 Winston on your team which was debunked extremely early as a bad idea for competitive play. I wonder why hero switching is still considered core to this game when it is instead a core toxicity problem.*On the other side of this, I have also seen people fight over ONE hero to play such as a Junkrat, Genji, or a preferred support. So much so that the team will throw if they don't get that one specific hero and say that it's not their fault that they aren't being allowed to play at their best so they don't try. Weird mentalities, but also weird how the game is in a position to not fix this or encourage one tricking / encourage multiple hero picking in any shape or form. The current system is promoted to where you just deal with the drama of what is likely to occur every single match and hopefully your team is adult enough to swallow it.It usually isn't.","

"02/15/2018 01:40 PMPosted by Mizzerellawhat is your reason for only playing 5-6 hours the entire season?Not exactly on point here, but I'm playing to maintain my rating with maybe an extra game or two thrown in when I do. As I mentioned above, being forced to play is inherently unfun in itself when I don't get to choose how I want to spend my time on a game. When the game mode isn't exactly fun and usually a bad experience what else can be expected? I enjoy playing QP mostly, I would like competitive to feel more competitive if I was going to care more about it on a more ""I can't wait to play tomorrow"" mentality like when the game originally launched.Playing in an environment that feels like a daycare half the time is not exciting, competitive, or enjoyable. I do my weekly games in a competitive focused manner, for the required time as enforced by the game, and I then feel relieved until the following week. What a way to promote a game if someone asked me how does competitive mode feel in the game!*EDIT*When I go in game it says I have 9 hours played for the season. I'm sure I'll end up with 10-12 by the end of it. Does it really matter though how much I have played this particular season to iterate my experiences from climbing gold - master? I clearly played a lot back when seasons started and I play much less after becoming Diamond due to decay and the problems that linger within the competitive system leaving it undesirable for me, as documented above.","

They need to have harsher punishment for players who often disconnect and reconnect more than once during the match or who leave matches frequenly. My last three comp matches had leavers who left and did not come back. On my fourth match we had a player on our team who disconnected three times and then re-connected 30 - 45 seconds later. We lost because he was not in the game for half the time.After losing all of those matches I get into a match where we could not capture the first point on a payload map. When it was the enemies turn they captured it in about 15 seconds and our entire team was dead. They did not even need to use any ULT's. The highest Gold elims on our team at the end of the match was about 5 elims and half our team (tanks and dps) had only 1 or 2 elims. It was a totally unfair match and I ended up losing 27 SR even though in the last match we almost won a 5 vs 6 due to a leaver on our team and I had 4 Gold and I only lost 17 SR for that loss.I think this is some BS!,"

This system alone has helped people climb or drop much more than they should. I have personally won 3 or 4 games I can recall because the enemy team gets a leaver. This is not competitive, this is not fair, and the other team is wrongly dropped in rating because of things outside of their own control. You can't say the competitive system treats people fairly and ranks you where you are supposed to be when this occurs much too often still.","

"One thing that has always bothered me greatly about Competitive is the fact that the system is very unfriendly when it comes to losing. Aside from experience, if you lose a Competitive match you get NOTHING. No Competitive Points towards gold weapons and you lose rating. Essentially, losing a competitive match means you've wasted almost half an hour of your time.Now, I know what some people are likely to say...""get good bro."" Okay, but even some of the best players (and no, I am not counting myself among them) can't always carry five dead-weights. Additionally, you cant always control how your teammates are going to play...I've played comp matches where people legitimately throw the game because someone else picked their favorite hero, or because someone picked the ""wrong"" hero. Also count in leavers (intentional or otherwise)--and, of course, simply poor comps or players. A lot can go in to the game that determines whether or not you win that's not always 100% whether one solitary player out of six is a good player.Take World of Warcraft for an example. Yes, a completely different game...but in that game, you are awarded Honor whether you win or lose. Winning certainly gives MUCH more honor than losing, enough to the point where it could mean getting a flashy new piece of gear in a few days or a few weeks, depending on how often you play or win.So, I would recommend that you get at least ONE Competitive Point just for playing. That way a loss, while still negatively impacting your Season Rating, doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.","

"I don't like comp because of how SR works. This game is a team game, however, you have your own personal skill rating to help you match with others of a similar skill rating. Sounds good simply put, but it's quite terrible to be honest. There are way too many variables with SR that pushes the consideration of your actual skill to the back lines. Your SR is based mostly around you winning or a losing a comp, with either random teammates or your friends. If you're doing well, but your teammates aren't and cause you to lose, you get punished for that, and vice versa. I think SR really needs to be based around solo performance, at least in solo queue. Now I'm not saying solo performance should account for all of it, but it needs to be somewhat of a factor with winning or losing still playing a major factor into how much sr you get. Imo, this would eradicate boosted players from a skill rating, and your teammates would be more evenly matched (minus smrufs unfortunately).","

I have started recording my games recently because I was getting a thrower/troll every game.I might make a Youtube series on all the crap in comp.

"So many good points already made. With all the gripes, frankly we just want the game to improve. The experience is so inconsistent right now.Man, solo in this game just isn't fun though. I've tried to have fun with it, but too many times I just ask myself: is this fun, what's the point?OP's First point is pretty key, it hurts, cross-matching groups and solo was never a fun experience. So many times that maybe it could work, it just ends in frustration. Lack of roles is pretty much why I don't like playing OW anymore. I can't play what I want, I don't have fun being forced one way or another because of what either my teammates or an enemy is playing. It's decidedly anti-solo. The system that seemed so interesting at first reveal, that the game completely depends on (hero-swapping), turns out it's something I can't stand. I didn't realize at the outset I was the kind of person who only wanted to play one way. Turns you OW definitely helped me learn that. Too bad I still never played the character I liked in Comp, it was never the right pick after all. In fact it's that system that keeps making me think that even a free to play game like World of Tanks would be more fulfilling. You select what you want to play, then are placed in the match. And yes, stats end up being tracked per thing played, as well as overall, leading to better personal improvement when you can see what types of things you do better/worse in. Sometimes I wish OW was World of Overwatch. Then shurg and think time to go to an FPS for old people.What's crazy is that I generally like team based shooters, but only when they've got setups that allow solo players some flexibility in how they affect the match. So much of OW comp is tied up in being Seal Team 6 with 30 seconds of time to get to know one another, that being the kind of person that would do better with chat and voice turned off completely doesn't matter. I think I could go on for hours. Mostly because there's such a great game in Overwatch, but man, Comp destroyed my ability to enjoy the game. Especially when I could just go and play some tank shooter with accurate stat tracking, queueing for the role you are good at, the ability to influence matches with strategy, Chat Off not affecting your play, and a MMR in standard modes, while still being ""good"" in those modes additional does translate well into the more competative/strict ones. Never expected to be spoiled by how well done certain aspects of other FPS games are done, and wishing OW would overhaul a bit.Because I'm done with comp. Last time I seriously played I rose hundreds of points and gained two ranks. Didn't feel like I was anything more than lucky. And I'd group-queued. If a bunch of people at the same rank can spend a couple days grouped together and all rise a couple ranks because now they are winning by playing against mixed and soloist groups, the system has some explaining to do.Game doesn't have many incentives to play more than required to keep up rating once you get to a #### you're comfortable with. After all, the game doesn't offer much achievement/progress outside of collecting shinys and raising your comp ####, and the rate at which that #### can fluctuate in a day is insane. It's tough to take it as practice when you're a solo player with a single account and a day of ""practice"" could end up a losing streak you don't seem to recover from. The system doesn't incentvize playing a huge quantity. Shame.","

I would love a solo queue/role queue. This doesn’t force meta at all. It shows you will have an even 2-2-2 and it does not lock you to a role but you have people who have the ability to make a proper comp.I love to tank. And backup heal as zen. But if I get 4 dps I’m gonna struggle with should I stick with a tank or a healer? Because at that point I feel I am not gonna be able to do either effectively since covering for 4 dps and a lone healer seldom works out well in my elo.,"

Because at that point I feel I am not gonna be able to do either effectively since covering for 4 dps and a lone healer seldom works out well in my elo.From my experience, if role based queue had to be forced as 2-2-2, it would still indeed be better than what we get right now playing solo. At least you go in knowing what to expect and that your team is ready to play as those roles. Team queuing could easily still stay as the game is currently and people just pick whatever because the game is centered around rating you as a team which makes roles not required. If you play with someone or an entire group of someones then I'm assuming you know what people can play / what people can switch to if things are getting rough.It's just a shame this game considers the most popular way to play this game as not as important as 100% supporting the premades, solo players will always be more numerous in almost any game you play, especially for shooters. It's just weird, maybe an oversight on their part similar to the original idea of having duplicate heroes on the team being ok and balanced.02/16/2018 08:37 AMPosted by PlayerTfw you think rank in a game allows you to comment on the validity of statistical systems.You clearly didn't read the post. I decided to give an overview experience of the climb / day to day game feeling vs. telling people how to rise higher in the ranks and how great of a feeling it was to finally be at X. Most people who get Diamond and above want to say how anyone can get to where they are by just doing X, Y, and Z. I wanted to give the reality check of what the overall feel is for the common solo player that I see time and time again in my matches. I wanted to convey how frustratingly silly your SR is dictated by luck and not your own skill in a good chunk of your matches, too big of a chunk in your matches even. If I get to Master this season I get there knowing I won at least 6 matches so far because the enemy team had a leaver, that I had to be good and flex when the general group players cannot or will not. I'm not in any shape or form gloating how ""good"" I am.Thanks for stopping by.","

I agree with you it feels like it favors some aspects of the game. My overall consensus of the game is that it does not feel like they are adding enough to the game or keeping up with the growth of the community. I feel that if you had more game mode options that were not rotating in the arcade but stand alone like qp; you would see more balance in the community. I see teams getting flamed for going “try hard” in quick play. So already a large majority think if you don’t go there to mess around then you’re playing that game mode wrong. I get that game has a lot more leniency in mistakes vs consequence because you don’t have an enemy team playing their mains all the time. But now you lack a place to be able to learn because I like playing against the try hards because they give me a situation I need to find a good hero choice for. We have to face it the game needs a lot and the devs probably don’t know where to start. But a better alternative to how comp is now would be the better choice I feel.,"

"02/15/2018 01:24 PMPosted by KrytonDoes anyone have stories they can share with competitive play? I would be interested to hear how other people feel about the general game to game experience others have had since the incarnation of this mode.Sure. I don't feel the competitive system is perfect, but I'm pretty happy with it overall. I'm Master rank, for reference.There's a lot of variety in how games go. Occasionally there is some toxicity in chat, but almost never before the team is demoralized or losing, and even then at my rank most people will try hard to win until the very end. Some games people are pretty focused, and you have constant call-outs on targets or ability cooldowns. Some games people will suggest particular strategies, like quad-tank, or have a specific plan of attack to deal with a problem. I've personally formed a plan for Numbani A based on walking a deathball onto point, pointing Reinhardt at their hitscan, and relying on Reaper to murder anyone jumping down to contest; it worked very well because we caught a McCree with his pants down on point, and despite the outcome being fairly lucky people were quick with praise for the plan after the quick victory there.There's often excitement in comms when someone lands a big ultimate or kill. Some games there's a lot of humor in general; a couple people are chatty or witty. I've been trying to save a nearly dead Reinhardt from Genji and he shrieks that Naruto is going to kill him. There might be much chuckling over someone on either team making a boneheaded mistake. Sometimes people are just having a good time, and if someone is popping off there's often praise for them saving the day.On the negative end you get comms regarding disappointment. Often ""oh no"" if Widow picks someone, or ""we wasted ultimates there"". At Master rank this sometimes shifts into tactical discussion like an analysis of what ultimates remain on either side, or calls for retreat. Sometimes chatter will be along the lines of ""widowmaker is wrecking us"" or ""soldier is uncontested on high ground"" and then discussion of who can deal with the problem, whether it is changing characters or just changing strategies. And yes, sometimes people get very demoralized and seek to lay blame or moan about it in chat. After a loss there's sometimes insults thrown about people being uncarryable or a thrower.On the personal gameplay side of things, there's still a ton of variety there as well.As Zenyatta sometimes I feel like I'm outputting lots of damage, but we still lose key fights or I stop popping off eventually and we lose, though certainly sometimes we just win and I feel like I did a lot. Sometimes I feel like I'm superfluous or not having a big impact, that I die very quickly to flankers but we still win fights. Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing much, but teammates later praise the orb placements or my main contribution was surviving a Tracer's attention all game. Sometimes I kick myself for not saving Transcendence, and sometimes I just save the day with it. Some games I feel like I'm getting absolutely wrecked by a Genji or D.Va, and chide myself for letting them kill me so easily, while others I spend the whole game stomping on a Tracer and feeling good.As Zarya it's more feast or famine. Sometimes I can play aggressive with a Reinhardt and just roll over the enemy team. Sometimes I get disintegrated over and over and try consider if I need to swap or if I'm doing something wrong. Some games it seems to go well but all the squishies behind me keep dying. Lower near Diamond I found I could easily bully opposing teams with charged up Zarya, but later on it's more common that there's no spam character and I find I just can't get energy.Overall I rarely feel like the game was hopeless from the get-go. Some games are hard-fought, going to 2 or maybe even 3 rotations through attack/defense. Some games we just lose and lose each fight, but afterwards I ask myself what was going wrong, and I can almost always identify a different approach I could have taken that might have worked better. Sometimes it's a pretty painlesss win; we take an early lead and never let go of it.But perhaps more importantly, I have fun. It's a fun game. Sometimes I have fun because I'm winning. Sometimes I have fun because I'm personally performing well, or winning some satisfying duels. Sometimes I have fun because the comms are very positive or humorous; those are often the best games for me. Sure losing can suck, and some games really are demoralizing even for me, but the good far outweighs the bad in my opinion. Ignore toxicity, and there's always the next game; on the whole the other players are fun to play with.","

"I kind of wish Blizzard used all their hidden stats more. Like if I get a team that has historically an 8% win rate because it is various heroes not mixing well, then it would be nice if it didn't take so much of my SR on the loss. Because it was very expected with the people I was handed.If I get a nice team composition that has like 80% win rate, I'd honestly not mind losing and losing SR because then we deserved it for being worse than the other team. But as the game works, with a good team composition you almost always win.","

"[edit : I loved reading your post, Arzoo. Thanks for taking time to share]I think the soloQ problem lies on ""bell"" matchmaking. I'll try to explain myself :How OW's matchmaker creates its data :* Overall playerbase, from worst to best* The worst players, as well as the best players, are much rarer than the average player. Put the best player at the lowest rank, he will not stay long. And vive versa. Climbing from below is very simple, Fall from above just as common (decay).* The majority of players are therefore ""in the middle"" (high silver, gold, low plat), with less players as we go either to worst, either to best. (i.e : a bell)Consequences of a majority being in the middle:* As differentiation of personal skill becomes much more vague (because quantity), the same SR can be : an excellent player but had no luck on his previous teammates picks (bad teamplay), or a rather average player who won the MM lottery (mates who pick the right guy, play team > good teamplay). This problem happens less above a certain rank, as a majority already knows how to flex, communicate in voicechat, and globally have better skills. From mid diamond and above, a victory will be decided mainly on the teamwork, and less jeopardized by picks, or skill.* Since everyone is not exactly same SR at team composition, matchmaker tries to avoid the drama of putting you against too stronger players by distributing all 12 players, and will be satisfied when it gets an average between all SRs. Ex : If a 2800 SR gamer is paired with a 2600, it will find a mirror 2800-2600 on the opponent team and put you, 2650, into the match. Matchmaker then assumes both teams are balanced, except they're not ... If the 2800 SR finds the opportunity to jump on you, you have high chances to be screwed. According to matchmaker your team's 2800 SR guy should be able to jump on opponent's 2600 and balance it all ... except it's absolutely not guaranteed. Opponent 2600 could hide behind a shield, stay at distance, be protected by an ult, etc. This mechanic is used in all ranks, but as the ""diamond and above"" SR win/loss is static, these higher tiers fluctuate less, and SR gaps are way more important in the middle.* the matchmaker will also make the decision not to make you queue for more than 3 minutes. If for example he did not find 6 players at 2400, he will put one at 2300, and one at 2500.* Finally, to avoid wasting too much time, the MM does not try to absolutely find roles that suit yours, that is to say the one you prefer. That's why we can often end up with 5 main dps, or 5 main tanks. Once again excellent flex players who master all the roles will be more ""above"" than in the middle.* Now pick up these 4 big principles* shake it all* cook for 20 minutes over low heat* put some salt* and that's the big mess we all know as silver, gold, plat, low diam. (or should I say .. the lottery)Add to that, ""tilting"" : if we are too low, we smash everything, easily imagining ourselves in higher ranks. Once at our season high we say ""wow I did it"", focus on higher, until we get a bad matchmaking (a dps main that ends up having to heal, a heal main that must dps, etc, or just a strong opponent). Then we fall back in the middle, from where it is much longer to get out. We think it's not deserved because we have already been higher, tilting ensues, fatigue ensues, catching up to where we think we belong becomes an horrible experience.The competitve environment is a set of interrelated problems that create new ones on their own. The solution is not simple and would require several adjustments, that can also have interrelated consequences. But hey, I guess Blizz is working on it (I hope)._________________About the ol' saying : ""just be good"". Well yes and ... no :)- Yes: if we pick heroes that do not really need teamwork (typically, some dps). A Tracer for example will not wait for a shield to charge a healer, or a healing orb for recall. But ...- ... no, when ""being good"" means more oriented towards strategy, team synergy, so typically support and tank (except roadhog of course). Because precisely many are fed up with believing in good matchmaking, many decide to focus on being strictly dps (some even strictly one hero). Except Overwatch implicit rules are clear : tanks are vital, healers aswell, and each role needs the other. Classic example : a 3rd dps painfully agreeing to fill the 2nd heal. Picks Zen. Focuses on shooting. Tank gets rekt, he gets rekt. Returns to dps. Loss streak.TL;DR : for most people, bronze/silver is easy to get out of, diamond/master is comfortable to stay in, everything else is a rollercoaster of interrelated problems.","

Where Hanzo can just outwait your wraithform to Headshot you at rapid speed Instead of you baiting out scatter and moving in for the easier kill.

Please note that there will be loopholes as there is with casinos but this will limit the ""freedom"" games has at the moment. I suggest you all read it.What are your thoughts? Do you want regulation on lootboxes?According to the article (can't get reddit to open on phone), these are the laws that are incoming:1. Games that have microtransactions can only be sold to those over 21 years of age. 2. They must mention that they have gambling in the rating content of the game. 3. The publishers must publish the drop rates for items. Apparently there's a 4th. May have missed this. So let's go down the list:1. Overwatch has 30 million copies sold in 2 years. They aren't getting those copies taken off players. That just means newer versions of the game will be harder to buy in store. But anyone with a PSN, X-Box Live, or you know, a PC can just buy a digital copy. Because you can just lie about your age. So this law just hurts future, physical sales, and nothing more.2. This does nothing. At all. People who are old enough to buy these games themselves don't look at the warning label. Parents who are buying a game for their child who is under 21 (and let that sink in that you still need parental consent to buy a game at age 20) already don't care about the rating, otherwise they wouldn't be buying it. 3. Blizzard has already published these. Twice. For 2 different countries. They do it again. *shrugs*4. ??? Ultimately these laws just affect future sales of physical versions of games. Doesn't affect Overwatch. None of them ban microtransactions outright, just restrict the sales of physical versions. All I expect to happen is a spike in digital sales, and they aren't going to police that. So what you end up getting is a hurt in retail stores, which escalates to them being non-profitable because they aren't selling enough copies. Big business like Target or Wallmart or BestBuy make up for their loses elsewhere, or they just see them as unprofitable and drop them all together. But non-chain, mum-and-pop stores go out of business because they don't have anywhere else to make up their lose of sales because now they can only sell a huge portion of their games to a fraction of the market. So... Cool for Hawaii.","

"If i were you i wouldnt want anyone to touch OW-s lootboxes because anything that can happen will negatively impact everyone. Lets summarize shall we:-If anyone under 21 cannot buy boxes,it means they have to make up for the loss of income, lootboxes will be expensive.-When that is coming,they HAVE to make lootboxes more rewarding,because no one is gonna buy more expensive lootboxes for the current droprate.-This leads to the already existing ""Golden Lootbox"" and the idea behind it.-Bought lootboxes will have increased chance of getting epic or Legendary items, OR always guarantee at least 1 item you dont already have. While normal earnable lootboxes remain the same.I dont even need to explain how that will impact the ones who dont spend money.The second option is that they remove lootbox entirely from the shop(which is unlikely) and you can only buy currency.Which can end up being too expensive for low currency,or extremely profitable,making ingame lootbox and currency income from them obsolete.I believe,Blizzard already adapted in China to lootbox regulation in a genius way,which is:You can only buy currency (VERY LOW amount,like 15-30-50 etc) BUT you get lootboxes for free for your purchase,according to how much currency you bought. This means technically,you didnt pay for lootboxes,hence not gambling,while the economy remains the same.","

Not like you get free samples waved in your face all the time to keep ya buying or anything.Not like people have gambling addictions more than people have alcohol addictions.It's not like kids are developing these behaviors as early as 13, the behaviors of spending money on a random chance with no real world value or benefit.Well MTG and YuGiOh are random packs. Well you can buy any card you want in specific and not from some devalued not real currency. They also retain a real world value, trading value and lets say a ban happened on a player? You still have your assets. Sold a foil cavern of souls for $125 couple months ago. A friend sold 4 revised dual lands that he paid $15 a piece for in the 90's and payed his rent. (I am sure a lot of you understand the blessing of basically getting an extra pay cheque on a hard month.) What do you get from loot boxes these days in terms of value? To see a weapon skin? Trade value? Actual worth? It's just spending money on something that can never benefit you...","

We have several mom-and-pop video game stores in the Baltimore area, and that is precisely what they do.Why? Because they're not going to compete on newer titles with Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target, who are already selling copies of those games to people who likely also came into the store for purchases not even video game related.They can't compete with Steam and digital sales. Hell, GameStop can't even do that.Their bread and butter is the retro-games, which are physical sales only. No digital downloads back then.","

Thing is, digital content is much more problematic for many more reasons.  Unlike card games which you can either buy card packs to hope to open what you want, you can buy those cards from vendors, online stores and many other places without having to risk gambling to get what you want. Card games such as Magic also hold secondary market value so even if you don't get the card you want, cards still hold a monetary value both big and small and can still be traded or used for various other things. Digital content is stuck being just that; a digital non-physical product that you're buying so you're essentially spending money on nothing and while games like Overwatch don't have ""pay to win"" mechanics through lootboxes, many other games do so this isn't specifically targeting Overwatch but they still will be affected by it. Lastly, gambling is much more dangerous when a parent's credit card is tied to a game console that their child also plays. A kid can simply charge however much they want and get all the lootboxes they desire while trading cards require the child to physically go to a shop or location and have the parent's credit card to purchase said trading cards. Still possible but a lot less likely. So in short, the whole ""Whatabout""isms for trading and collecting cards is a moot point to argue. Their regulations have existed for years and their ""gambler's addiction"" is far less likely and much more preventable than simply pressing the ""buy"" button on the lootbox page.","

(Aka you end up paying less in the end)Legendaries have 2 things going for them from what I can gather.1. Random chance, as with everything, random chance you will get a Legendary.2. Pity timer - this timer is not effected by random chance drops (at least I don't think so) and after so many boxes you SHOULD be garenteed a legendary drop, once it drops, this timer resets and waits for the same number again before dropping another legendary.Combining this will explain why sometimes you get 2 legendaries in the same box. Or how you can get 2 back to back or very close to each other.Buying stuff will not make your random drop chance go up, and obviously doesn't effect your pity timer. As stated above however, you will get more dupes, which means more gold, which is a good thing given the fact the random chance and pity timer both do not garentee said legendary will be an event one.","

"I don't think it will work out how you think it will.PBSR is what makes climbing possible despite bad teammates.  For the longest time people hated losing SR despite having a good game but with terrible teammates and losing.  I remember countless threads about how personal performance should affect SR.Then they told us that personal performance does in fact make small difference in SR gained/lost.  After learning that and the rise of ""one tricking"" the general opinion of the community changed and ""we"" decided that PBSR was a bad thing.PBSR has both good things and bad things associated with it but to be honest I don't feel any of the positive effects of removing it.  It just feels more frustrating to climb. I'm still getting one tricks and I feel like all of them are Sym.Resetting MMR isn't going to make anything better.  Everyone lumped into the same pool isn't going to be very fun.  Due to the varying range of skill, matches are going to be very lopsided and everyone will more than likely place way lower than they were.  Eventually the system will sort everyone out and we will all be more or less the rank we are right now.  So essentially it will do absolutely nothing except make comp miserable for a few months.","

"Because people like to win. The game has been out long enough that some of us have tried all the various wonky team compositions, and we know that some heroes just don't work well. Especially when they're played on maps that don't suit them, or in situations that don't give them any benefits for the team.You call them meta slaves, but really it's just called experience.","

"Meta: Strategy, heroes, or team composition that gives you the best chance to win in the current patch.Competitive: A game mode where you should primarily aim to win.Offmeta: Heroes that are weak (for a good reason) in the current patch.Example: If hitscan heroes didn't exist and you play Pharah, you'd probably do great and she would be really strong, but you gotta adapt when they introduce hitscan heroes and they keep shooting you out of the sky and you're unable to do anything instead of calling others meta slaves.","

I'm better off having fun. I view the SR/Matchmaking system a bit differently than a lot of folks. Most want to climb. I just use it as a tool for getting more balanced matches. As long as my performance and tactics are consistent, I'll get to a point where I can have good matches without following any ""meta"". I just patiently play the game and wait for the system to adjust me there. Much more fun than stressing out.","

Then here's some truth for you that you will love to hear.In competitive:Your Reaper accuracy is bottom 4% of the PC playerbase.Your Tracer accuracy is bottom 1%.You have 3% weapon accuracy on Mercy, also bottom 1%.You deal a whopping 600 damage per minute on Reaper, which is bottom 2%.In Quickplay:Your average KD ratio is 1.24 - bottom 6% of the PC playerbase.Your average eliminations per minute is 1.21 - meaning you die basically every minute.Over 22 hours on Hanzo, you deal an average of 570 damage per minute, which means that you land ~4.5 arrows per minute to the body.If you're landing one Hanzo arrow every 13 seconds, I don't think you have any room to tell people the optimal settings to play OW at. Based on the pathetics stats you show in both QP and Competitive, your FPS clearly isn't ""smooth"" otherwise you would be at least below average instead of literally bottom of the barrel.","

"Thank you, for absolutely shafting us with the new standardised start times for the weekday OWL matches.Beforehand, most people in Europe would have to stay up until roughly 1am to see the end of the first match of the day. Late, but doable for a lot of people. But now, we'd have to stay up until roughly 3am just to catch the conclusion of the first match of the day! I don't know how the organisers think it works here, but, we do actually have jobs to go to and classes to attend etc. Maybe start the games at 12pm PT and have longer breaks in between games? The format at the moment is an absolute marathon session for all viewers and casters etc. I don't think I'm alone in saying 6 or so straight hours of OWL burns you out pretty quickly.Had to post this in here because, for some reason much like there's no EU Gear store, there's no dedicated forum for OWL.","

The Chang to time is to help them as they should be blizzard first priority when it comes to owlThem changing those times has nothing to do with the fact London had to play 3 games on the last day. They've remedied that by moving the Stage playoffs to a Sunday instead of having them on the final Saturday alongside 3 other matches.As for teams having a short gap between some matches (a late finish and early start) that happens very rarely and usually only between Friday Night/Saturday afternoon matches. The start times for Saturday afternoon matches are still much earlier than other days so the time to rest and practice in between matches still isn't great. But I see your point,"

"Idea I wrote after watching this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CknHni1xOnAHanzo should have a burst arrow. Basically, when you hit a barrier a cone of explosion damage will come out on the other side. Kinda like those artillery shells that are made to burst out the other side of a wall. The cone's burst would be fairly narrow so aiming is still involved, but it will burst a fair ways back to catch those further away. I think at max it should do 75 damage to those closest to the blast and taper down slowly from there, then stop at a range. The damage is to catch out those low health enemies hiding behind the barrier. I feel sorry for the Reinhardts here but the damage wouldn't be too bad for them. The cool down would be relative to other arrows. Kinda sucks you could only use it on barriers but if it went to through thin walls that could be OP, even if there was ""drilling time"" before it burst. (And hard to implement i would guess) So I'll say no to drilling.Though it would make sonic arrow even more useful and fun. -The more I think of it this could also replace or enhance scatter arrow; burst on other side of barriers, scatter on walls and floors. (or possibly change the scatter to an explosion to make it feel more consistent, if that's necessary)Any constructive comments?","

This isn't a game that was designed, played, and then became an esport. It's clear that they had esports in mind beforehand and worked towards making them happen.The International is successful because the fans want to see it happen, and they are the ones that significantly provide the prize money (myself included). When you push a game as an esport rather than as a game and let it evolve into an esport, you miss the mark and alienate the more casual players I feel.","

It sounds like you watched Contenders, which was honestly a very dull, one-sided tournament by anyone's standards because most of the teams were not Tier 1 so EnvyUs just crushed them all. OWL will be much, much more even, and if the preseason is any indication, there will be much more diversity in comps. During the preseason, the only hero that didn't get play time was Symmetra, which means that even the likes of Hanzo and Torbjorn got picked a few times. As far as personalities, once you get to know the casters and players, you can get really invested in them. Everyone has their preferences, but I truly think all the casters do a great job and make the games even more entertaining, and there are multiple popular streamers in the league, so that gives you some familiar faces to follow. I get it's not for everybody and I don't want to shove it down your throat, but you might be pleasantly surprised if you give OWL a try. :)","

"When this genre kicked off back in Quake almost 20 years ago, it was built on a simple premise. You got good, joined a clan, your clan joined a league, and you would compete, not for a personal rank.. but for the reputation of the clan.It was great. Most players, probably 80-90%, were in clans competing in leagues, and the vast majority of those communities got the full blown OWL (as Blizzard has branded it) experience. It wasn't just for a few people, it was for everyone.I was waiting for Blizzard to take this natural next step with Overwatch, but where is it? All I see is a company (who's games I generally enjoy) take something that used to be enjoyed by everyone, and make it something uniquely the right of a handful of top players, arguably 0.0001% of the player base. Why?What season is this, Eight? How many people play this game, 30, 40, 50 million? Why in isn't a there a clan system yet? Why are there no leagues?This was something a community 20 years ago figured out with no help from a developer. Here we have an opportunity to take the memories of some of the best competitive matches people had in TF and share that with tens of millions of people in this game. But what does Blizzard do?Sorry guys, this isn't for you, it's only for the 0.0001% of players good enough to get into our ""cool kids club"". The rest of you are just going to have to enjoy the NOT AT ALL TOXIC, clan-less, self defeating, personal performance obsessed joke of a competitive system, BUT HEY, you can watch your favorite top teams have all the fun in an actual, functioning, competitive league like all your older counterparts did in games for years! FUN HUH!I get that Blizzard is taking advantage of the younger crowd's ignorance, not knowing that this was a standard in team shooters for decades, but to spin this and turn it into a money making machine, while withholding it from the rest of your base, it's pretty.People can like OWL, that's fine, but there's no excuse, no reason why you would start this clan/league structure from the top, and simply end it at the top.. It should have honestly started at the bottom, then and only then, the end result AFTER a successful and popular competitive system, do you capitalize on that and create OWL.You should all be asking why the  a game like this, this popular, with this much developer attention, still doesn't have a clan system or leagues yet.http://qwtf.digitaljedi.com/^ Why doesn't this exist. Could give 2 about OWL honestly. I want the game I paid for to have ""at least"" what free mods had 20 years ago.

"As an ""older"" game, I remember my Quake days and fully agree with the OP. Competitive play should be started in a grassroots environment with clans / guilds.Not only should there be clans in OW since the beginning, but there should be various leagues to play in, not just the OWL which less than 0.001% of players participate in. Every sport has both a minor/B- league, and additional amateur leagues that are more local.Building competitive OW from the ground up, instead of top-down, should have been the approach by Blizzard. As a console player, who also finds the Dive meta stale and boring now, I have little to no interest in the OWL. The matches just have the same 9-10 heroes in every game playing in the same style.Why, after almost 2 years of this game being released, we don't have a flexibile, robust clan system already? Why, as a team-based shooter, wasn't some kind of a clan/guild system a priority since day 1 of development?","

A simple anecdote. However, lets look at that one more closely shall we?500 hp with armor, but all he can do is walk around slowly, swinging his hammer at all that ranged dps classes who melt him from a mile away while he struggles to find some cover. Compared to the small profile of Lucio who can duck and hide behind anything he finds, all while at least being able to shoot back....But okay you want a closer a comparison. Ana gets hacked, no more self heal, and she has to try and take pot shots at her slowly with her biotic rifle. Just as squishy as Lucio, no survivability options, and no changes to her from before. So all they've done here is leveled the playing field. Sorry if I don't feel bad for poor old Lucio.","

I don't think Tracer is going anywhere and Genji is not even close to being a staple in meta comps so Sombra could easily be played together with Tracer.

"She certainly needs something. The devs changed her extensively and repeatedly for months, got tired, left her in a spot that the Mercy player base doesn't like from a play experience point of view, and moved on to other heroes. I wish they had done things differently. I wish they were more willing to step back and reassess their view of Mercy based on first principles. But things are the way they are, and we're stuck in the spot we're stuck in. Hopefully they'll come back to her in the future. When they do, I hope they'll be attentive to the spirit of the feedback from the Mercy community and willing to approach Mercy with a more open mind and with the courage to change what needs to be changed. The essence of the feedback is that Valkyrie is not nearly as engaging/fun/dynamic/impactful an ult as they envisioned it to be, and it's not loved by Mercy players nearly as much as resurrection was. If you change the most iconic aspect of the character so drastically, you should replace it with something else that the player base feels as strongly about. I like some of the revert variants, but I don't think that's the only way or even the best way to go from here (and I'm pretty sure the devs are strongly set against revert). I'm happy to keep an open mind about future Mercy directions, as long as the devs realize that something is wrong with where they left her now. Some careful thought, some time, some  listening, and some courage need to be put into this.","

"Two things - either the team isn't getting picks so the Moira's trying to take things into her own hands, or the Moira doesn't understand her character very well. Either way, most of the time it can be fixed with a simple polite conversation over chat to figure out what the core problem is.That being said - a lot more people want to play DPS/Tanks over supports. If you really want to make a difference, practice up on your supports until you're capable at your current SR, and switch to a second healer. You'd be surprised how well a Mercy / DPS Moira combo can work in some flanker-heavy games. If you see a gap in your team, fill it.02/14/2018 04:50 PMPosted by HireathMoira have a healing bar who can be empty really fast if you start healing each individual :( She can't solo heal a team, She need a second healer !To be honest, that's not true at all unless you're playing into a shield heavy comp. You'll definitely need a second healer / moira to switch if solo healing if you're playing into, say, a Rein/Orisa combo. Moira will never have enough healing juice to go around in those circumstances.However, if you're playing into any other combo (D.va Hog combo is super common in my games as an example), Moira is incredibly capable as a solo healer. Like anything else, the team does have to be more focused on playing together as a group to take full advantage of Moira's AOE healing, but you can push out 25k+ solo healing in a ctp comp match without a problem.","

"So ive decided to make this post to, hopefully; make the forums a better place and to teach people to argue like the rational species we are, if only i change a few people or someone learns something thats good for meFirst of all, Starting from the very basics, How to use the tools at your disposalMany people seem to think using caps or bold text to shout is a good way to make your argument strong, It doesntBolded text should primarily be used to highlight important parts of an argument, as to make a TL;DR of your argument for people in a rush or it can be used to create sub-titles mid text to properly make your message cleanUnderlined should generally be used for titling and can also be used for highlighting; but its less noticeable than bold Caps should be used very lightly; to start up a sentence, as writting everything in caps is portrayed as aggresive, a proper arguing person has no reason to be aggressive, that makes you look bad or immature other than that it can look good to highlight titles or to priorize a title over the otherLists are extremely useful when trying to say multiple things refering to one same general topic, Like im doing right now, it makes an message look clean, and it makes it easier to read Quotes should be used to point out what your responding to, or who, it can get confusing if no one quotes anything and all you have is loose messages, Also, its a good way to show examples of posts Theres not much use for italics really, i recommend to use it when quoting someone when you cant actually use the quote system because its not in the forumsProper filtering your textGenerally, when you want to argument something, You dont want to make a giant wall of text as that is confusing to read, everything bends in together and nullifies eachother, Proper titling is very important it filters the content of your giant wall of text, For the sakes of an example, imagine that im making a post about nerfing mei  (this is just an example!!What is wrong with mei?Mei has been a must pick since the game has started, she has had 80% pickrate in OWL, and has been dominating matchmaking, her primary fire does too much damage and its extremely frustrating to fight againstThe solutionEndothermic Blaster:Reduce damage From 100 to 50decrease freeze duration from 5 seconds to 2.5It also makes it easier for people to quote your post by sections  and respond to it in partsProper arguing mannersBe chill: Arguing in all bold and caps like a gorilla doesnt make you smarter, its much easier to respect a calm and composed argument than a guy shouting in angerDo not attack the person: This is something i see very often, Attacking a person on a personal level to prove that their wrong is dumb; Stuff like ""Oh your plat shut up"" or ""You say that because your stupid"" is a big no noBack your argument up with data:This is self explanatory, its much easier to understand someone saying ""Jeff kaplan is op, he has 99% pickrate and 70% winrate across all tiers, and he has higher average elims than any other dev Provide where you got your data:This is important, as the data you might be basing your argument on could be wrong, and its important to know this. Do NOT attack grammar: Same as the second suggestion,attacking someone because of their grammar and underappreciating their opinion due to grammar is wrong, Dont get me wrong, proper grammar is important to avoid misunderstandings but dont attack someone because of it!Notify edits: If your editting a post,you want to notify others where and what you have editted, especially if people have already saw your message, if you dont this can cause people not to notice this and cause a misunderstanding!This is all for now ill edit the post if i want to add anything else","

"Now, now, I know that they're not exactly alike, and that there are differences. But bear with me as i'll try to explain my logic here.Both Mei and Roadhod are about disrupting the enemy team.- Mei uses her wall, and to a small extent her main fire freeze ability, to disrupt the enemy's teamwork.- Roadhog uses his hook to grab enemy players out of their position, therefore also disrupting the enemy's teamwork.Both Mei and Roadhog are made to be able to defend a certain area, due to their strength in close combat and their ability to 1v1.- Mei accomplishes this by using her increased survivability, together with her main fire freeze.- Roadhog accomplished this with his ability to hook-stun enemies, as well as his high damage in close-to-mid range combat.Both Mei and Roadhog have a ""selfish"" ability that allows them to increase their own survivability, by sacrificing damage.- Mei uses Cryo Freeze to null any damage to her and heal her in the process. She can't deal any damage while doing so.- Roadhog uses Take a Breather to heal himself for more than cryo, but has a reduced damage taken while doing so, instead of a full immunity.---So let's say, for argument's sake, that Roadhog does indeed fulfill the same role as Mei. Let's take a look at how they compare.Roadhog is a tank, which means that he disrupts the enemy team. And while he'll generally have lower overal damage done when compared to DPS, he offsets that with increased survivability.Mei is a defensive hero, who is also made to disrupt the enemy team. She, as Roadhog, generally does less dps than regular dps. She also has increased survivability compared to other heroes.Now if you look at it like this, they seem rather similar. However! While Mei's damage is probably about as high as Roadhog's overal (if not lower!) she has nowhere near the tankiness of Roadhog.While this is partially offset by her smaller size, it's nowhere near enough to be called even.---Now while lots of people say she's supposed to be a disruptor, I ask you this:When, exactly, is a disruptor worth the sheer loss of damage, compared to a normal dps such as Soldier?And when, exactly, when you want a disruptor, would you not just take a tank, who can arguably fulfill that role better, while having better survivability?---The way I personally see it, and note that this is all just my opinion, is that while Mei does do her job well as a disruptor, she has too little damage. Making it so that there's more value to be had in just picking heroes such as Soldier, or Junkrat, who can easily do incredibly high amounts of damage. Disrupting the enemy team just very VERY rarely seems to be worth more than the raw damage of other heroes. ---What do you guys think about this? Do you feel the current Mei changes on the ptr are what she needs? Or would you prefer more survivability? Perhaps more damage? Or maybe some added effect, allowing for Mei to disrupt the enemy team more?Looking forward to what you guys think!Cheers.","

I'd like a slight rework for McCree with these changes:1. Change McCree's primary damage to 752. Change McCree's fall off damage to 40 at the low end3. Remove Fan the Hammer from the game4. Give McCree 250 hpWith those changes McCree becomes a better anti-flanker that rewards skill.,"

"Okay i this is just my opinion so if you say ""its overpowered or bs"" please state reasoning so i can comment....thank youSo i looked at the new changes they are looking at for Sombra, Mei and Doomfist. I liked a bit of it but one thing I've been wondering why dont they make Sombra's Ultimate EMP cancel transformation based Ultimate's. Before i go into this more they are testing her with her hacking ability affecting mercy's angelic ascent. The reason why i think it would be beneficial is because it would help make her viable, most players who play Sombra myself included get negative comments for playing her and sometimes you face those players who play torb, bastion and winston as examples. Though it does take great timing for canceling their ultimates but for newer players they find it difficult.So for example of a situation if they made this change to her so your facing one or many of these players it helps her and her team make better engages and make more of an offensive then defensive character.The other thing i would like to change is that when Sombra is hacking torbs turret it doesnt auto target her so she can actually hack it So if you like to comment and see if you can see these changes being good or bad Thank You","

"I don't think Torb's level 2 turret is the problem.  I think his level 1 turret needs a buff (I'd say a much shorter cooldown, which would open up new strategies of being able to place level 1 turrets quicker as they become destroyed) as well as his armor packs to better support the team.  He should also be able to place an armor pack on his turret if he so chooses.Level 1 turret should be more of a mobile low-health turret -- if you've ever played TF2, think of TF2 mini-turretsLevel 2 turret is more stationary and powerful","

Repair and refilling ammo takes priority over upgrading.The only difference however is the TF2 sentry can actually hold it's own and be a threat even at level 1. A scout that tries to take out a level 1 sentry with an Engineer hitting it dies almost 100% of the time.","

"<span class=""truncated"">...</span> Sombra is an orphan, and I don't think she knows any of her other family, even if she has others, the friend possibility is still thereSecret daughter?This is highly doubtful. Sombra is not the ""mother type"" nor is she the type to be given a child. She is written to be the character that knows everything. A plot character, giving her a child would be pointless and irrelevant for the sake of a name.For all we know, it could be her ""ded name"" or a name that she use to give to the people of Mexico to know her by before she became ""Sombra"". She has relations to the bakery, as she is seen as a child with baked goods giving it to the head of police (Odds are is the mother of Alejandra took Sombra in as a child, and Alejandra is more like a ""little sister"" possibly in ways, but that's pushing the envelope as Alejandra spilled her location BUT who says that Alehandra's last name and her mother's last name isn't Colomar? IF they took Sombra in, since she was an orphan, odds are is you'd give your last name to the child if they don't have any) She also was most likely affiliated with the Los Muertos Gang as a young adolescent (The skin she has and hence her tagging things everywhere) so she possibly started to become ""Sombra"" latter as the woman giving her the implants was of the gang itself.The name cannot be found by anybody as all of her data was erased so that makes me wonder exactly HOW they found her name... The only way someone could find out her name is if they have connections to the ""Iris"" that saw Sombra as a young woman. Sombra wouldn't give out her name to anyone as that leaves her wide open for being found out. The whole point of Sombra is that she is working undercover. It doesn't make sense for this ""professional hacker"" who is giving plot to the story to be easily found out. It defeats the purpose of who she is. If so, that is pretty lazy writing in my opinion >.> Her name is odd indeed as even I mentioned the name to my cousin and he said ""That doesn't sound Mexican at all"" I even tried looking up the last name's origins but found nothing. Even Reaper's last name (Reyes) is ""more Mexican"" than Sombra's which leads me to believe she isn't that stupid (hopefully...for the sake of her character) Now, can Sombra be of mixed decent? Yes, as Pharah is so we don't know really and Sombra is a mystery (Though Pharah's Rainmaker and Thunderbird skins showed otherwise whereas Sombra has nothing really on her to signify this) however, the odd thing about this, is that Sombra played it off very smoothly. She looked surprised but shook it off fast (Yes, probably because she had no time to dwindle on it being in her position, but I expected a more ""angry reaction"" if you will. Especially if you were really found out, which shows it's probably a placeholder name)","

All supports.Mercy has the highest play time because I play her when:1) I'm watching my shows.2) I'm knitting things to donate/for friends/for self.3) Playing with friends so I have to keep them alive as much as possible. (Also talking more than paying attention to the fight)But my main is Lucio for payloads.Ana for open maps.Moira (now) in general.Sym when I'm really bored and don't care about winning because she's garbage and expecting to win as Sym is silly.Zenny when I feel like being a birb boi who kills things with mah floating eggies.If I am super drunk I usually play xbox OW using Soldier/Genji because I don't need much brain power to play them successfully and about 20% of the time flailing around on the controller gets me where I need to go. lmao,"

"Reaper and Moira. Reaper because I learned to be good with him, and now being decent with him (I wont say I'm actually good because I often suck at the game but compared to other heroes im better with Reaper.) It's just what I'm used to. Also I like his character/appearance. Edgy is my aesthetics.Moira I picked up nearly instantly. She just came so naturally to me, she was the playstyle I was looking for and trying to get out of Zenyatta but he's not well built enough for it. I enjoy healing, but I also like being a DPS, (also I'm not like most I will put healing over my DPS.) so Moira was right up my alley in terms of play style. If we need a support I'm insta locking Moira, she's my support main.","

Doomfist because he's fun as hell to play and I'm getting decently good with him. Sombra because I suck as a healer and often can do as much healing with hacked health packs as I do with mercy and moira, Ana I can out heal them all on but I find i get dived on a lot and burned down quickly. Zarya because if there is a main tank already picked I want to be able to do decent off tanking with a high amount of damage out put and I suck using dva's Defense matrix.","

"I'm not sure who said, but there is a term often associated with Overwatch,""The Only constant is you.""This is objectively false.Simply put, the other constant that I can choose in this game is the most important; my teammates.To cut to the chase, Overwatch is a game that rewards teamwork, that's not a bad thing by any means, but the group function that is allowed in comp causes quite a bit of problems on its own, and I'm not talking about 6 solo players going up against a six stack. Some people believe that a solo and group queue should be implement to even this out, but in my experiences playing in peak low times I would say that there aren't actually enough players to make a system like this function well.I think that the group function as it stands in comp suffers from 2 major issues.1. SR averaging. Mostly this is when a group of two players join together because one person is hoping to have the other person carry them and the other is using the lower SR person to artificially reduce their SR. Now the worst that could happen here would be, for example, a 2500 player and a 3000 player playing in the 2750 range.Now, on a personal note, I don't think this is that big of a issue because more often than not the low player isn't ready to play at the higher tier and the higher player can't actually carry the team like they think, but I see the real victims here are the other four teammates who have to suffer with the two stack.If it were up to me, to dissuade this from happening I would have the group's SR default to the highest ranked player.2. The Group chat. I play on the  Xbox One, and I think that the worst thing about playing and seeing a stack is in your team is the 50/50 chance that they aren't going to join team chat. you can message them to join or try to get their attention, but they either don't know how to or refuse to do so. What I find so frustrating about this is the overwhelming probability that the stack actually all have mics, yet they refuse to talk to the rest of their team and you have to suffer for their stubbornness. Furthermore, as I stated, I play on the Xbox One and with that there is also a Party chat through Xbox Live so a person in your game may be in a party by themselves or with players in other games while you are stuck with a mute teammate.Communication is key in being an effective team, so I think that something can be done to help remedy this problem.In comp I think that Group chat should be removed as the default in settings so people can't forget to switch to team chat or have to manually mute all teammates if they would rather play in silence. Further, I recall in COD MW2 back on the 360, party chat's would be inaccessible in certain game modes or would not be available when a party was active. If this were available for comp specifically, then I believe quality of life for matches would improve.As for QP or arcade, I could honestly care less.","

"I actually think the grouping problem could be fixed by encouraging more people to group.Right now, it's hard to find a group in competitive. If the only people you know in real life don't play Overwatch, or play but at a significantly different SR (higher or lower) you get stuck.If we could make finding a group at your SR an easier process, it would be a big help. This comes back to a LFG system and a clan system. Both are social tools which would give us more power over who we go into a competitive match with.Sure a 6 stack that always plays together is probably going to be better co-ordinated than the 6 stack that was just formed 5 minutes ago in a LFG lobby, but it's still far preferable to a 4 stack and a 2 stack being shoved into a group against that same 6 stack. Or even worse, a group of solo players facing that 6 stack.With those social tools, it should be easier to form groups and therefore easier to match groups against each other for the matchmaking system. We just need the barriers to forming groups lowered.Right now if you don't have anyone to play with, your only option is to use a third party service or discord to find a group. That doesn't work great because it's a lot of hassle so not many people use those things, so it's harder to find a group using them.","

"I've said this before, allowing solo queues and stacks in the same party is a mistake.Comp originally only allowed a full stack to play, and the game still had toxicity back then, but it got much worse once they allowed solo queue.Quickplay was taken more seriously, because the solo queue people couldn't go to comp on their own, and comp wasn't clogged with all these players with some superiority complex, because stacks are usually more satisfied with their matches and were able to build comps that revolved around the heroes they WANTED to playIMO, they should re-introduce the stack only queue, BUT not before they implement some kind of guild system (which a lot of people want). That way people who want to do comp are able to find others of a similar mind, and they;d be able to build better comps around each other's preferences.","

It's like how the floating orbs around the spawn-side teleporter represent TP charges remaining, you don't really notice it until you know what to look for.Edit: I went to the training range with the classic skin to test it out, and yeah you can see her charge on the gun.

He seems like good defense, take high ground but his damage drop off is so fast, unless you’re hitting every shot, you aren’t doing much. Attack seems good cause allows you to get in his sweet range more often. However, he’s so immobile, unless you have a mercy that stays on you, it’s really hard to survive.He’s not much of a tank buster... fan just tickles them and they take to many hits to kill before they can kill you.He’s not really anti flanker.

Flash bang is to quick to finish them off w fan the hammer.Like what scenario exists where you go... “hey we can use a mccree here!”?Yeah I guess he’s the best at killing Pharah but if you piss a good one off, she can be quite difficult so still gotta give upper hand to her in most cases.What’s his role do you think he performs best in and how do you tend to figure if he’s what the team needs?","

"McCree is a hero that needs to be protected to a certain extent to be effective. he has amongst the highest damage potential if he hits headshots and fth is an underrated ability for quickly dealing a large amount of damage (i typically use on tanks or shields)flashbang can also help you delete characters that are not careful around you and if coordinated with teammates can be incredibly deadly. (i used to coordinate with a reinhardt to flashbang above the barrier and then immedietly earth shatter).some misconceptions about McCreehe does not directly counter flankers like Tracer and Genji, but given the right circumstances, he can instantly delete them.he does not directly counter pharah, but he can duel her on a reasonably consistent basis (as opposed to someone like Reaper who can tickle her at best)when do you want to pick him?if your aim feels on point and you have a team that you feel you can rely on to support you. e.g. McCree generally won't work if your team is running dive comp. McCree is a very solid character as is most of the cast, in mercy meta deadeye was one of the best ways to delete valkyrie mercy","

"It's a pet peeve of mine when the animated cinematics show the heroes doing things they can't do in game.I was quite happy when D.Va gained the ability to attack while boosting, and I'm a proponent of Reaper gaining some kind of concussive grenades like he often has in animated form.Which leads me to Hanzo.Despite being desperately in need of a rework, and in all likelihood being removed from the game soon, Scatter Arrow featured prominently in the Dragons short.Rather than introduce a discrepancy,  I propose an elegant solution:When Scatter Arrow is retired, take the visual effects from it, the tiny rebounding bits, and add those to Sonic Arrow. Thus they become tiny auditory sensors that disperse in the area and provide the sonar pings that Hanzo's imaging tech uses to see through the walls.The integrity of the Dragons short is preserved without being at the expense of any gameplay issues. Nice and tidy.","

"So I've given some thought to what I don't like about over watch is banning system. What I really don't like about it is the players inability to see reports against them. I'm not saying we should know who reported us. What I'm saying is we should use an infraction system to know why we were reported. My best example of this is narutobase.net. While you could not see what you were reported for, whenever you had an infraction, you were told exactly why the mods weren't happy. This could be implemented in a similar way to improve the over watch community. My idea would not only tell people why they're being reported, but also confirms to the reporter that the report was sent in and has been actually seen by the user they reported. The reported user's reaction would also be able to tell Blizzard weather not they will actually improve their behavior, whether or not they keep being toxic or keep on griefing. Users, who wish to improve their behavior can more easily do so.","

"02/12/2018 07:41 PMPosted by Acestial(Please take time to read this all. The down votes are from those who have not read it.) p.s. someone is on a down vote spree to make it look like I dislike other's opinions and which I have not down voted or will not anyone on this thread.One of Reapers abilities, wraith form is proof to Reaper being a wraith.By definition a wraith is a ghost or ghostlike image of someone, especially one seen shortly before or after their death.Reaper was seen shortly after his death when Mercy supposedly saved him, but did she really?Let's look at the big picture.Mercy can ressurect people, but for a price. Mercy didn't exactly resurrect Reaper though.A wraith is also an apparition of a living person supposed to portend his or her death.Meaning, the Reaper that we all see and know ISN'T Gabriel Reyes at all, but a mere after image of him.Now I know what you may be thinking, hold the phone, he is able to do physical interaction right? NOPE.Another aspect of wraiths are their powers, since they are considered spirits they are able to manipulate with a supernatural force.Wraiths, in lore, can alter human perception and use psychic powers to manipulate the environment. This gives us a view about why his shotguns always disappear when he drops them and how he makes new one's out of thin air.The facts all add up. Reaper isn't Gabriel Reyes. Reaper is a apparition of who Gabriel Reyes was.This is ridiculous.","

"Honestly I’m still more afraid of a tracer and genji because they can apply constant pressure even if your grouped, and still secure kills with thier high burst. Sombra still will constantly have to leave the fight and run back. She’s much easier for support to fight back against. She’s really only going to punish people that stray off on thier own. If your with a team she’s going to have to quickly leave after taken any damage.Just relax. She is still one of the lowest on the dps spectrum, hacks are still the same cooldown, people won’t even notice these changes unless they are playing sombra.  A ten percent reduction still has plenty of spread, Translocator time was too short to begin with. They explained the typo on opportunist it doesn’t see you through walls till 50% like normal these are all just quality of life things. None is close to game breaking. Then they buffed hacks against passive that normally just stalled until the hack is over. And all these hero’s primaries still out burst her. She also lost health pack ult charge which is huge. That’s not a emp every fight anymore. It’s all a bunch of small thing with a big hit to hero that was being out done by every other hero statistically speaking.","

Strafing like a madman - only 50% to D.va health i could drain up before she kills me under shield gen. Every halfdecent dps also kills her pretty fast.

"Hacking Lucio is consistent because the songs are an effect of Crossfade (the ability), which is just a permanently channeled Shift ability whenever Lucio switches songs.Once he gets hacked, Crossfade is disabled, so the song effect also stops--much like hacking Bastion ends Sentry mode, not just preventing him from going in or out of it.edit: Is it fair to Lucio, whose pick rate has been bleh recently?  Maybe not, but it does position Sombra in a very good spot to counter quad tank before it becomes a festering plague on the meta like Mercywatch.","

Lucio will be the only support who literally loses his entire kit outside of shooting when hacked and has his ult deleted by EMP without requiring much effort.First thank you for being sensible. Second, the only counter point I would put out, is that Lucio is an off support. He's there for speed boosting the team but.... In reality most Lucio's play him just to wall ride, and boop people off the map. To that end, the Sombra buffs do not affect him. He can still do that, she hacks while he boops her, he's vulnerable, and she's flung off the map.  However, if he is where he supposed to be... surounded by tanks/dps... then she is going to have a much harder time getting to him to hack and then kill him. Perhaps his ult interaction should be looked at... but then again a lot of heroes can straight lose their ults to a normal sombra hack. He only loses it to her ult. Meanwhile, an enemy Ana can negate a Zen ult with her grenade.","

ThanksFrom what i understand though placements (apart from your first) are not really that - They just hide your rank for 10 games and you basically place +/- 200 from where you were depending on how you went in those 10 games. Or at least thats how it was in s1-4. Have they changed placements so its not more of a reset?So the system will let us queue for placements and then not after if the difference is over 1000? I think it used to be 500?,"

At this point Mercy is just pickrate damage control.There's never a point to using your gun, which is why mercy feels one-dimensional. When was the last time you've seen a Mercy actively defend herself? She has a better chance if she just hides from them with Guardian Angel. The least they could do is turn Guardian Angel into a more defensive ability when her gun is out. Make it targetless and self-burst heal on a 10 second cool down.","

"As always i want to drop my opinion in the forums.So, we know that NOT every hero is relevant in the pro-scene or meta and some heroes would be played more than others, that's a fact so...I'm worry about all these RE-WORK thing, the game is young because and in my opinion some these heroes don't really need a rework at all, just adjust the numbers up or down and do the same with other heroes.For example: HanzoIn my opinion, he """"just need"""" down the damage of the Scatter arrow, because is one of the MAIN problem, he can literally ONE-SHOT from the distance any hero in the game. So, maybe decreasing the damage of this ability to a max of 220 damage?, while increasing the damage or attack speed of the basic attacks. And to make him ""more relevant"" and useful in the meta, could have a mix between the SONIC ARROW with a small area stunt/disorientation, like the sonic arrow 2.0 has the ability to see around and also Stunt or slow heroes who are in a the small area of HIT, like a ""flashback grenade""You guys can also increase the movement speed while is doing a normal attack and also reduce the charge time of these attacks.So many things can be done before event thing on add a completely NEW ability.Another example would be TORBJORNHe is really fun hero but maybe not so ""useful"" in pro scene. And is because the turrets takes LONG to build at lvl 2 and lack of mobility of course.So maybe the turret has ""Auto-build"" like Symmetra turrets but over the time, lets say 5 seconds? but if you HAMMER the turrets you build it faster than you normally do right now. So, you could drop it and it will auto-build in 5 seconds, or you can hammer the turret and do it in 2-3 seconds?To not make this hero ""OPAF"", the turret could be no 360 view turret and has maybe a CONE attack, like 180, instead of 360. And also reduce the auto-aim accuracy or aim speedAnother thing is decrease or increase the distance of the view of the turret (i think right now is a bit long, could be shorter)About armor, could be like every time an enemy or friend die. That drops INSTANT armor of 10 if Torb is around, so while your friends can pick up, Torb also can pick op and convert them into ""super armor"" when dropped by him with like 60? instead of 50 or maybe more, i don't know, so would be like 10+60. So Torb can create these super armor and players can pick up normal armor from the floor.So to not make this endless, i'm a bit ""against"" of RE-WORKING every hero, because is not used or relevant in the meta, i know this changes help the game to bring fresh strategies and new stuff and made heroes relevant, but let's be honest, not every hero needs to be relevant and useful in competitive. What would also help is have new heroes a bit more often.REMEMBER this is ALL my opinion and ideas, just bringing some ideas and things that can be done with what we have right now instead of RE-WORK a cool hero. In any case, forgiven my engrish! :PEDIT: title","

"WOW i receive some thumbs down! XDAnyway, after watching the Developer Update of Feb 14, 2018Sounds really interesting!...I like the changes on Mei, would be nice to see it in action same as Sombra, i think this will bring back more Sombra mains to the game! :DDoomfist seen like a little buff, nothing to say about Doomfist other than make him more OP so he can INSTA-KILL anybody in the game... just kidding! XDAbout Hanzo, i have mixed feelings... maybe because i'm a ""Hanzo main"" XD... but sounds really interesting, specially if the pierce arrow pass through the shields, but sounds ""to OP"" in some cases. Mainly because there are few abilities right now (that can remember) that pass through barriers/shields and they are ""slow"" abilities (Symmetra's secondary fire, Moira's orb, Hanzo's Dragon, Reinhardt's charge, Doomfist's Rocket Punch, etc..). And we can ""easily"" dodge them. But if the Pierce Arrow is as fast as a Widow shot, people is going to complain about it, except with be like the old days of QUAKE were you have the RAIL gun and shot without the zoom.In my opinion will be a game changer ability, because now you wont really need anything to break the shield of a (Orisa or Rein) + (Bastion or Torb) combo, so ""no more"" Pirate Ship and people will calling out the Hanzo Mains! XD...""Dude, switch to HANZO..."" instead of... ""Hanzo don't work dude, switch!"" hehe...About the Leap... WOW that sounds GOOD, i have to try that.About Symmetra and Torb, i have already gave my opinion here...https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761777106#post-1And herehttps://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20761687589?page=8#post-141Anyway, great changes looking forward... thx!","

Lol but whatevs.I'm fine with it. As annoying as she'll be I am tired of the same two flankers chasing me and just failing to do f* all. Maybe Sombra can be a new cat in the cat and mouse game I play with flankers. You just get so used to Tracer and Genji's tells that nerfing them is just redundant at this point.Fix Genji's hitbox though other than that they really arent a big issue. They suffer the same as support, when you gut and nerf heroes in their class another rises to take the spotlight. We need more supports and less nerfs just as we need the rest of the dps line up to be less situational and more viable.","

"I know there's probably no perfect match making system but I think competitive play should change the queuing system, where players select a preferred role (dps, support, tank, fill, etc) before being put in the que. I can't tell you how many matches I've lost because players refuse to change off their favorite DPS even though it's not what the team needs. I typically fill by playing tank or healer and enjoy those roles, but if the other 5 players aren't onboard then there might as well be a surrender option and take the lose since it's a waste of time dealing with trolls for an entire match. Add a feature like Yeti Hunter had where people can have a preferred role (not guaranteed) and match making selects at least one queued healer, tank and DPS and leaves the other positions opened to ""fill"". Just a thought. Tired of losing games before they even start is all.","

I doubt that you actually had matches with Reaper, Pharah, and Hog all in the same game and didn't get utterly trashed.And at 7 games won, your gamepool isn't exactly high to have a meaningful percentage.","

And I am steamrolling with Winston near 80% win rate.You have the freedom of jumping the back line and bc of cooldown you can go literally untouched. Jump high to start cooldown. Land, punch, bubble, shock, kill. Jump out. No consequences. I can even still run him is they are playing reaper hog pharah. Winston needs to be strong to counter alot of bs but I'm not sure he deserves to jump in and out with no punishment.Suggestion.Jump CD starts after you land.

"I'm a Crusader, I love to crusade. But D.Va is truly a God amongst us tanks right now. You can bring her to dive, you can bring her as the off tank for a death ball, and she fits perfect into a 3 tank comp.So I play all the tanks, and lately I've picked up D.Va more and more, and I'm shredding things. This is what I've learned: 1⃣️  She counters Moira's Orbs. You would think this isn't a big deal, but ask any of the Moira players here, they will tell you that not getting full use out of their orbs can slow their healing economy and healing output. She can also dive/spike Moria hard with her rockets after Moira shifts away. 2⃣️ Her mobility is fantastic. She contests snipers on the higher ground like no other. I've also noticed if I can hit most my rockets on Pharah, she is good as done. This allows her to be good for dive or death-ball, she is just about a perfect fit into any comp.3⃣️  Her ultimate is one of the best in the game imo. Why? You get it rather fast, and it can be combo'd with all the CC ultimates in the game to great effect, or you can simply zone out/clear the enemy on the point for the finishing win. Also many good D.Va players know how valuable being in Mec is so they will Self-Destruct when they start to die just so they can get back into mech faster. It's really good.4⃣️  DM with Boosters is incredible. Yes DM can still help counter enemy ults, but where she really shines is her ability to combine her DM with her Boosters to get out and save her mech. I've learned good D.Va players are very aware of their health, and try their best to stay in mech so they can keep harassing. 5⃣️  She counters most of the hero roster. I couldn't believe how effective she is against heroes like Junkrat. If you can dive him with Dm, Rockets, and then unload, he drops like a rock. 6⃣️  Boosters plus punch/melee. This isn't to be underestimated, this a combo of 25+30 damage. 55 Damage. It's perfect for finishing move (like a weaker Genji dash imo). To conclude. I think D.Va is the best tank in Overwatch. I used to bring Winston as my off-tank for mobility, or dive, but I'm starting to realize D.Va's kit can do more. I feel like she is good in the mid-fight and late-fight. Plus with all the Moira's running around, she fits so perfectly into a team comp. I'm not going to hang up my hammer just yet, but I'm going to be playing D.Va a lot more. I actually feel like I maybe able to climb the ladder with her. And for someone like me, who enjoys shot-calling, you couldn't ask for a better hero to climb with.","

"I dunno man, I find D.Va to be extremely weak to a Roadhog of equal skill if it's a 1v1 scenario. Roadhog specializes in 1v1s, D.Va doesn't. Roadhog can heal all the damage she does and can live through her ult at point-blank-range with his Take-A-Breather. You can destroy her mech-suit in about 2 (sometimes 3) shots if you can get some crit-damage in there. She can't fly away from you if you manage your cooldowns properly, as you can just hook her back to you. It's all about cooldown management. She can't stop your ultimate with Defense Matrix either, lasts too long, and if she stays in your face she's going to get knocked out of her mech.Something interesting, if you hook someone and then hit Q as the hook begins to reel in, they will take a HUGE amount of burst damage and burst knockback, which is sometimes even enough to just one-shot her mech.Roadhog is also the only (practical) self-sufficient Tank, he contains self-heals, has amazing damage, and he doesn't need high mobility as he can use his Hook to pull in from far away, or use Take-A-Breather for escaping. I'm TERRIBLE with weapon accuracy, slow projectiles are my speciality though so I have an over 60% hook accuracy.","

Smoke the enemy, and see where are they through this combo. Also smoke screen will help nearby allies to escape as well.Another argument: he is ninja, ninja must have smoke bomb.Another idea is to have fire arrow as area denial.

How would the smoke work from your PoV? Would your team see a giant smoke cloud and be unable to see where enemies are unless you have Sonic Arrow? What visual indicator can it give your team so they know the smoke is being used?,"
						Feb 15

"I assume like being in a thick fog. I guess smoke should cover space around 10-15 m in diameter for 2-3 sec, maybe with fade effect. Players on both sides should not be able to see much in the smoke (maybe 2-3 meters ahead). Sonic arrow should reveal red silhouettes and help your teammates to shoot in the right direction. However sonic arrow would not reveal any barriers, just silhouettes, so the enemy could actually be hiding behind the barrier in the smoke.For players outside, smoke would block line of sight and it may effect heroes abilities. For example soldier tacvizor would not auto aim through the smoke. Smoke could also interact with the abilities. For example, D.Va bomb could disperse smoke completely.","

"Those are some insane Sombra buffs, and by insane I mean GOOD. I moved over to Overwatch around 6 months ago from Paladins and my main was Skye, and anyone who's played Skye knows that she's the Sombra version in Paladins, so when I started playing Overwatch around August, I immediately took to Sombra as my first main, but then stopped playing her soon after and moved on to other heroes. These little changes are exactly the things I wished she had back then when I was trying to main her, smaller gun spread, a little longer window for the translocator, 15 seconds just felt a little too rushed, faster hacking, etc. I'll take all of these changes over a slightly slower ult charge any day. Sombra is so much more than just her ult, but I always felt like her kit was a little underwhelming. Definitely a step in the right direction with these changes.

"lmao, but imagine deciding to target someone you see through a wall, and it turns out they're pretty much full health. RIP.Her hack pretty much destroys Lucio though. He'd be the only support who has all his utility completely blocked once hacked. Her EMP already signs Zen's death and destroys Lucio's own ult. It's pretty bad to further nerf what the support class can do. I don't think Lucio can really afford to get any nerfs rn (indirect or not) without buffing him first.edit: that said I look forward to trying PTR later, and seeing everyone's thoughts afterwards.","

It's almost like having permanent wall hacks.Sounds amazing. Ultimately it does what to you? Nothing...her spread is still huge and unless you are running off to get a health pack by yourself you will still in the fight. This does nothing except help Sombra chose targets better. Targets wont be able to notice any difference in how she is played towards them.You are underestimating the value of this in coordinated teams, if all of this goes live, she might end up being must pick in OWL.","

"02/14/2018 11:38 AMPosted by ComftblyNumbThose are some insane Sombra buffs, and by insane I mean GOOD. I moved over to Overwatch around 6 months ago from Paladins and my main was Skye, and anyone who's played Skye knows that she's the Sombra version in Paladins, so when I started playing Overwatch around August, I immediately took to Sombra as my first main, but then stopped playing her soon after and moved on to other heroes. These little changes are exactly the things I wished she had back then when I was trying to main her, smaller gun spread, a little longer window for the translocator, 15 seconds just felt a little too rushed, faster hacking, etc. I'll take all of these changes over a slightly slower ult charge any day. Sombra is so much more than just her ult, but I always felt like her kit was a little underwhelming. Definitely a step in the right direction with these changes. Also I'm happy to see some small buffs for Doomfist too. Faster reload is nice. Good buff for Sombra but Skye is more annoying. I can counter Sombra but Skye I can’t.","

While some of the blame is to be attributed to the recent hero changes, I don't believe this is the primary reason. My personal proficiency and prowess with the hero has diminished, and I don't know why. I've noticed a little difficulty with the recent hero changes, as expected, but the changes were implemented long before I started seeing diminishing skill on my end. My stats have all fallen, my shots aren't connecting, I feel like I can't stay in the air in a way I was able to in the past. I've had an absolutely tough time playing the last month and I need to change something with her. It's like a light switch has been flipped and my skill with her just turned off. I used to pride myself about being able to go toe to toe with another Pharah even an opposing Pharmercy, and now I can't connect shots midair anymore. When there's another Pharah, I'm the one getting steamrolled, and I have absolutely no idea why! It's gotten to the point where I've limited her use to certain maps, mainly 1cp maps, but even then I can't seem to make her work. Despite a 63% winrate on her, I'm just not finding any success with her. I used to think I was pretty successful with her, my teammates did too since I was their primary DPS for 7 seasons, but now I feel my wings have been clipped, my bird's eye view blinded, and my missiles replaced with bottle rockets.Please... If any Pharah mains, OTP's, or casual Pharah players are still finding success tell me how you're doing it.

Also, this will give him more consistent damage rather than relying on his normal arrows which might be a big challenge for most for situations.Also, give this exploding arrow a boop effect for some environmental kills.I don’t really play Hanzo but I think this idea is great!","

The dps on the level 1 turret isn't so much that it's like having a seventh character on your team, but it can help pick off weaker enemies hiding.

"Alright, so, we all know about what happened to Lúcio in CTF. People found him way too difficult to hit due the immense amount of speed he'd gain and the ability he has to access parts difficult to defend so because of that he got nerfed. Personally, I feel in was completely unfair. Wall grinding may seem easy at first glance, but when it comes down to it it really takes skill to be able to reach all of those spots and to get the flag as fast as some can. I main Lúcio and I only managed to do this because I know the wall grinding fundamentals there for making it easier for it. This nerf just makes Lúcio an absolute bore to play and just further takes away anything fun found in the game mode which I actually began to greatly enjoy.","

"Obviously, we all hate scatter arrow because its a simple ability, with not a lot of mechanics involved, that does a crap ton of damage. The thing that bothers me, is Hanzo is a high skilled character, and skilled Hanzo's can really change the outcome of the game. Which ends up leaving the higher tier of Hanzo players stuck in a bad situation. I think a good Hanzo player doesn't need scatter unless they are using it for the taking down tanks. They can 1 shot carries and supports already with a head shot, so why not make his second ability a burst arrow. My thoughts:Exploding arrow: Let the Hanzo player get rewarded for actually hitting the target with the arrow and doing high amounts of damage, compared to the scatter, where you just have to hit the ground. Arrow does base damage, sticks into the target and explodes for a certain amount of damage.Poison Arrow: Once the arrow hits the target, they ""bleed"" or are poisoned like Widow's trap. Also, along with the bleed, they are ""poisoned"" and for a brief period of time, they can not be healed (like Ana's grenade on enemies). So far, we only have 1 ability that has anti-healing, I would like to see a few more.","

"Hey everyone! I wanted to share with everyone my concept for how Symmetra could be reworked to stay true to her character but provide her with more midfight capabilities and a higher skill ceiling. With these changes I hope to show that Symmetra can be a viable second support, providing alternatives to healing through shielding, and giving her buildables more utility. Overall, the plan is to make Symmetra less passive in the fight and less about hiding and protecting her Ultimate. Let me know your thoughts!(Note: These values are for illustrative purposes only, and could easily be adjusted for balance)Primary Fire: Photon Projector* Range increased from 7m to 10m* Beam is now a soft lock instead of a hardAlternate Fire: Energy Ball* 6 second cool down* No longer needs to be charged* Uses 20 ammoAbility 1: Sentry Turret* Turret size increased 50%* Turret health increased to 25* Maximum Turret number reduced to 4(Removed): Photon BarrierAbility 2: Photon Shield* +200 shield to ally* Duration 3 seconds* 30m range* 6 second cooldownSymmetra gives target ally a shield that lasts 3 secondsAbility 3: Shield Generator* +75 shield to allies* 25 Max Range* Duration 10s* 100 health* 100 shield* 45 Second cooldownSymmetra deploys a generator that provides increased shielding to nearby allies.Ultimate: Teleporter* Maximum range 35m* Duration 10s* 100 health* 100 shieldSymmetra creates a portal between herself and a target location for her team to travel between. No limit to the number of uses and can be used to travel either way. (Similar to Reaper Shadow Step)Comments:These changes hope to move Symmetra away from farming for her ultimate and providing her with more supportive mid fight potential. Changing the lock on her Photon Projector increases the skill level needed to terrorize the enemy team while removing the charge time on her Energy Ball allows her to be more active in the fight. Sentry turrets were destroyed far too quickly, so instead of altering their function their health and size has been increased making more direct hits necessary, but easier to land. (Winston can destroy them in 0.5 seconds still, however a stray tracer bullet from across the map won’t destroy the turret)Photon Barrier has been removed as, while it was useful, doesn’t really fit into Symmetra’s roles. Instead, it is replaced with Photon Shield, which instantly gives an ally 200 shields, providing Symmetra with an alternative to healing to support her team. Think of it like a Zarya bubble that does not make recipients unstoppable. This is similar to her original Photon Shield ability, however the ability is much more active. (and Blizzard already have the visuals and voice lines for this!)To combat the “farm and hide your ultimate"" strategy Symmetra has become known for, the functionality of the devices have been changed. Shield Generator has become a basic ability with a long cooldown, providing shields to her allies in a much smaller area (about half). Making the shield generator radius smaller and with a short duration means Symmetra will be more present in the midfight providing more utility, but also gives her enemies the opportunity to shut it down. Teleporter will now allow Symmetra to mark a target destination, placing a Teleporter pad in front of her and creating a portal to the target location. Symmetra and her allies can use the Teleporter freely for it’s 10 second duration, or until the Teleporter pad is destroyed by the enemy team. There is only one Teleporter pad at Symmetry’s original location. This change provides Symmetra with much more utility in the way the Teleporter functions, allowing her to initiate a fight by moving her team to a flank, help her team escape a losing fight quickly, or help respawns get back into the action. If used at a less than optimal time, enemies can capitalize on this, shutting down the Teleporter and splitting a team.","

"Most of these honestly sound like hard nerfs. That teleporter idea is awful, why would you want to turn shadow step into an ult? Most people agree its a !@#$ty ability. Increasing the size of the turrets would be enough to counterbalance increased health, you don't need to reduce the number of them. 25 health is still low enough that a punch could take them out. 4 turrets is nowhere near enough, especially since you didn't say anything about increasing their damage or anything. The shield gen makes no sense as a regular ability, especially with that cooldown since a lot of sym players can easily get a new shield gen within 45 seconds now. Making teleporter and shield gen last only 10 seconds is stupid because either you'd duck out of the way to use them and be out of the fight for a good chunk of those 10 seconds, or you use them in the middle of the fight and they'd be instantly destroyed because they're out in the open. tldr; nice try but no.","

In higher levels of play the Shield Generator and Teleport are almost instantly destroyed as teams have figured out the best spots to hide them, and Symmetra struggles to get value after that point. The point of the rework is to make her much more active throughout the game and reduce downtime, much like Mercy.Turrets need to be balanced for both high and low level of play. I don't think they are the issue with her kit, I think how easy they are to destroy is the problem. The number of turrets doesn't need to change, 4 was a suggestion. I don't agree that you wouldn't be able to use the buildables in a team fight, they are like a Supercharger, requiring help from your team to shield it yes, but you should be working with your team, not running around by yourself for 20-30 seconds finding the best spot to lay your ultimate.","

"Hi there,I play Overwatch on both Xbox and PC but mainly Xbox. I played a competitive game a few nights ago on Ilios. When the match started I immediately picked Moira and someone else locked Lucio. All 6 of us were in the voice channel but only 4 were talking. After I picked I checked people's career profiles to see what they played. There was one guy who only played support. His top 5 heroes were all supports. He had chosen Tracer since we already had 2 support and I said in the channel that we should let this guy play support. I switched off to DPS and waited to see if he was going to take support, but he stayed on Tracer so I said ok I guess he wants to play Tracer this game and switched back to Moira.We got destroyed the first round. Our guy on Tracer couldn't kill anything and kept dying to a roadhog every fight. I understand if you want to play a different character sometimes but we were playing at a high Master/low Grandmaster skill rating. The other team was playing characters they were good at and just deleting our support main on Tracer. Near the end we started saying how our Tracer never showed up in the kill feed and was behind tanks and supports in damage. I asked in the voice channel if I could play Tracer but he didn't switch so I sent him a message through Xbox that said ""can i dps"". Still no switch or response. Second round started and he still wasn't switching or doing anything so I switched to dps anyway. He stopped in the middle of the round to message me you kept roasting me so enjoy this LHe just threw the rest of the round. After we lost I messaged him back saying I reported him and he said idgaf console is a memeto which i responded that's why you play so much(he was a 4 star gold border with 2/3 of his hours in comp). Which brings me to the big problem with this kind of throwing. He said: don't worry, I'll put you on my 'throw' list since you're in love with me so muchBasically he preferred me so that he could throw if he got in a game with me and try his best if he got in a game against me. I know this kind of thing has happened to other people before and I think it's the biggest problem with the prefer player button. I understand why there isn't an avoid player button anymore, but I think something should change with how the prefer player button works to prevent this kind of thing. Maybe prefer players has to be mutual or maybe the thrower's prefer player won't work if the other player reported them. I honestly don't use the prefer player button at all even on people I liked or thought were really good because I'm worried that I'm going to be more likely to play against them and lose if I prefer them. I know I didn't come up with many solutions but I think that it's a feature that needs to be looked into.","

"I loved that handsome dude in the newest Dev Update video, but while he was talking about Mei and her freeze being increased from 1 to 1.5 seconds (which is a lot coming from a Bastion player who is forced to live with 1.5 second lockout times due to his ult), I wanted to know if Mei's ult was being buffed/fixed too. It looks like it hasn't, so here I am. Jeff, the beautiful OW team, the worst part about Mei is easily her ult. Since this game ""favors the shooter"" her ult has been getting harder and harder to pull off correctly, and more recently, AT ALL. Before any changes, if she pressed Q and died, her ult would still trigger.Then came the change where if she died/stunned her ult would not be considered ""in-play."" and thus she would still have her 100% on her ult meter. Then came the Genji nerfs where as soon as you press Q, the ult is considered used.The problem with this is that Mei is throwing an actual object, her Snowball friend, and if she gets stunned or killed snowball enters the 4th dimension, and her ult meter is back at 0%. How can someone use their ult, but have the game say that it DIDNT happen? From my testing, this is due to latency. Essentially on the Mei client she presses Q, but on a McCree client he didn't get the message that Mei pressed Q, and thus he flashbangs and that somehow overrides Mei's Q. However the Mei client says ""well, you used your ult so now you're back to 0%"" when in reality Snowball never touched the ground.This is what makes Mei unplayable, because her ult is a crapshoot. Nothing should feel this way, so can you make Blizzard favored in the netcode? This way latency, which is inevitable, won't screw Mei and her ult over? Please? It needs to start feeling like an ult, not an ability that gets eaten by Dva's korean space vacuum. I'll try and record some videos the next time I play her and post it back here.

"I mean, beam heros are mostly fair. You have single target beams like zarya and moira's right click, but then you have the multi target beams like winston and moira's ultimate. Just calling it a beam weapon doesnt quite define the weapon its self. The multi target beams all go through barriers and cant be blocked, while single target beams can be blocked by barriers, but not deflect and defense matrix.These multi target beam heros could be a solution to barrier comp. but the issue with that is the damage done if it cant be mitigated, must be balenced. winston has a really low single target damage while moira's is an ultimate. Currenty, the single target beam heros all include:Symettra (currently being looked at)Mei (also being looked at)Zarya (not being touched yet)Moira (duality, her right click i think wont be touched yet)while the multi target beam heros include:Moira (ultimate, probably wont be touched)Winston (not gonna be touched)The current issue with beam heros are already being looked at. The real issue with mei and Symettra is the utility of the beam. Mei's beam can be used to slow down characters, but the time to slow doesnt make her useful against flankers unless they have no mobility. If mei had a slightly faster freeze time, or she started to negate mobility abilities(if you start to freeze someone, the % to being frozen is the same % that the mobility abilites wont work. so 100% frozen means mobilty will work 0%, half frozen means like half an actual dash or blink).With symettra, her issue is how close range she is. For her buff, maybe increse the travel speed of her right clicks to move about as fast as orisa's halt. Im pretty sure currently symettra's right click is slower then the halt. That would give her some utility and make it easier to hit other characters. But the beam on sym is fine, if you get in her beam range, which may be a bit long. But that depends on the player. I win most of my sym v genji and sym v tracer battles, but thats different.","

Reinhardt's SidekickHP: 100 + 400 ArmorPlaystyle: Brigitte´s defining trait is using a personal shield to get into battle and prevent damage agains her. She's a Tank, but just like Roadhog she doesn't provide much protection to her team except when acting as a meat shield herself.  She has high survaibability. Her tankiness comes from her being able to be in the frontline and take a beating. Her Ult allows her to defend a specific area by herself. She provides some utility to teammates by granting them increased healing. Her playstile would be reminiscent of the archetypical paladin of other fantasy games.Look and feel: Brigitte would ideally look like a Sci-Fi or Futuristic version of Johanna (HotS and Diablo) (referential image: https://mr--jack.deviantart.com/art/Johanna-Crusader-of-Zakarum-545195782). Her color scheme and armor would look a lot like this skin from Battleborn's Galilea (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/battleborn/images/8/8c/Vanguard.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170621201253). Brigitte would wear the armor pieces, unlike Reinhardt's that's clearly a suit. To make it look more like the armor an Engineer or Mechanic would wear, this kind of joints would look cool (https://pin.it/3kr2la45ekcejp).   Abilities:LMB - Magnetic Flail / Brigitte uses a flail that connects the ball and handle with magnetic energy (no chain) / Melee works in combos. One click will launch the flail straight into the crosshairs direction (will ideally end up hitting the floor after the swing) / Range 5 meters in a straight line or arc / Keeping LMB pressed will cause Brigitte to swing the flail overhead in 3 fast arcs. / Base damage 65 hp on first direct hit. Combo starts 1 second after first swing. next arc strikes have a rate of 0.25 per second. Arc swings damage 55 hp per hit Magnetic Flail looks like the Scorpion Flail of Ratchet and Clank (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ratchet/images/3/32/Scorpion_Flail.png/revision/latest?cb=20130304134017)RMB - Defensive Stance / Brigitte raises her shield in front of her to absorb incoming damage. This shield is physical, not energy. Brigitte can protect herself with the shield but cannot attack while sustaining it. / Absorbs 1000 damage / Shield doesn't regenarate hit points. Once it has absorbed 1000 damage, Brigitte cannot raise her shield for 8 seconds. Once it's off cooldown it starts again with 1000 hp. / 10% speed reduction.E - Shield Throw / Brigitte throws her shield, dealing 100 damage and stunning the enemy for 2 seconds / max range 20 mts. / Projectile speed 40 meters per second / Shield uses magnetic energy to bounce back to Brigitte after hitting a target or reaching max range / while throwing the shield, brigitte cannot enter defensive stance / 8 second cooldown / shield can be thrown while Defensive Stance is on cooldown. Shift - Biotic Enhancer / Brigitte presses a button in the chest of her armor and it emits a wave of biotic enhancing energy / Brigitte and allies around her in a 5 meter radius take 60% increased healing from allied sources for 5 seconds (doesn't apply to healthpacks). / cooldown 10 secondsUltimate - Resonance Field / Brigitte slams her shield on the ground and plants it. Resonance from the slam creates a damage immune zone for Brigitte that lasts 8s. 6 meter radius from shield. After the 8 seconds, shield uses magnetic energy to bounce back to Brigitte.Anyways, that's my take on the character. I know several see her as a builder and this is not exactly that. As an engineer I figured she would build her armor, weapon and shield.I'd love to hear your comments :)","

"While it's a nice idea, got to remember that Overwatch's detail for Brigitte is that she is more of a repair smith for Reinhardt, rather than his squire. She is the daughter of his comrade; Torbjorn. So she'd be a better character for something more along the lines of constructing and repairing. If I had to choose anything, she'd be suited better for support or defense.  I would imagine her making specific items to block 1-5 blows before breaking. And she could fix them and reinforce them. But again; really hard to tell what she could do that her father or reinhardt can't do better at the time.","

When we got the comics and she looked so skinny I thought she would definitely take a supportive role. Nevertheless, after seeing her portrayal on the cinematic she looked like she had the build of a fighter, so I built from that idea. It would be nice to figure out some place in between Rein and Torb for her.","

"Hello everyone, first of all, thanks to the Overwatch team for finally put an eye on Symmetra, maybe together we can change her in a viable and stop once for all the belief of a ""troll pick"", the ""Cancermetra"" and the reports and bans.Also I want to apologize about some possible problems writing this text, English is not my first language but I'll try my best.Here I go.First of all, let me explain what I think about supports and Symmetra.There are 2 types of supports in Overwatch, the healing ones, the most known (Mercy, Moira, Zen, etc) and then there's Symmetra. Is Symmetra a support? Yes.But she doesn't heal...Because she is an UTILITY support.And that's about what I want to talk.She was designed to be an antiflanker/antidps support who gives utility to her team, so instead of healing, she gives shields, she slow enemies with her turrets, also do assistances, she can protect (just a bit) with a mobile barrier, and she open paths to short the distances to her teammates. Also another problem she has it's she depends too much on her ultimates to be usefull to her team, that's what I think we need to change, she should be an utility support without depending on her ults, and that's also the hate that Symmetra's cause, after you ult, a Tracer comes and destroy it, and your teammates are like ""Symmetra you are useless"" and in part it's true, a healer is helping to mantain the team alive in the fight, but Symmetra, needs to ally to die to use the TP and also needs to wait for Sym to have the Shield Gen to be protected by her. After that, Symmetra becomes a DPS who tries to do damage and kill enemies.Now let's see every part of Symmetra and how we can buff to become viable as a second support without depend on healing, heal doesn't fit with Symmetra. Also I think everyone should stop viewing her as a defense hero, so open your mind, without fear.These are a lot of ideas, doesn't need to use them all, you can pick the ones you like or mix them into a better idea.I want to start with Turrets.My beloved sentinels, let's see...Actually, Symmetra has 6 turrets, small ones, 1 hp, 25 dps, and slow a % for each one.I think this don't need major changes, but buff their viability.Sentry Turret.-No more slow on Sym to place it-It didn't need time to arm and active, also, when turrets are ""AFK"" they become stealth/invisible, so Symmetra can really create anti flankers zones and it will more hard to detect and destroy the turrets. Actually some turrets are just a waste of time, 1 hp and they are destroyed by random damage.-Increase the slow or instead of that, ignore part of Tracer and Genji movement (Kill a Tracer as a Symmetra, is nearly impossible)Photon BarrierIt's a great idea but not well implemented.-Give Symmetra a chance to hold it for some seconds, or decrease its movement speed, so Symmetra can control it better-Change her actual barrier into a new one, that size and hardness depend on how long you mantain ""E"", something like she charges her orb.-Mantain the actual barrier but give it a chance (a %) of damage reflection, so the enemy will think 2 times when the Photon barrier comes to him.Teleporter-Keep it as an ultimate-Make possible to put it on walls and ceilings (like in her comic) so it will be funny and also less predictable for the enemy find it.-Decrease the sound to become hard to find it.-Make allies gain a special shield that dissapear after X secods or a buff after use it (like seconds of invulnerability, so if someone throw a bomb or destroy it, you don't die again, and also gives her more utility.New funcion: When Symmetra has an active Teleporter, she can gain charges of Portal while doing damage or blocking it with Photon barrier, she can Press Q to create mini portals (like in portal game) to escape or go whenever she need it. This can only be used by Sym to reposition herself more easy and escape from death.Shield Generator-It's fine, maybe increse the amount of shields, also reduce it's sounds and be able to build it on walls and ceilings.-Keep it as her second ultimateNew funcion: When Symmetra does damage or block it with Photon barrier, she gain charges of ""Invulnerability"", so when she has charges, she can use ""Q"" again on an ally, to protect it from damage for ""X"" seconds, this ally cannot die while protected by Sym. If the ally have shields, it will become invulnerable or if shields are destoyed and the ally is almost dead, instead of invulnerability, it will give 100 shields that will decay over time (The effect of Shield Gen and this new Q aren't cumulative).New ideas to increase her utiliy.-Unlock her mechanic weapon as a second weapon and give her new abilities.-Allow her to build bridges, walls, portals, small structures that will create health packs or buff packs (movement speed for X seconds) or anything that you can think.-Give her new turrets (or disposives) separate of her normal turrets. These turrets will be for support her allies.Light turret: Symmetra can place up to 3 turrets that will focus allies in its range and repair their barriers and shields.The idea of this turrets if give Symmetra, the chance to ""heal"" shields, so she will become a good friend of Tanks like Reinhardt and Orisa, who depends on their barriers, this turret will focus the barrier and repair it. Also as the normal one focus enemies, the support turrets, will focus allies with shields and will heal the shields, instead of wait the normal 3 secs to start to regenerate. This will give more utility and more ways to Symmetra to protect her teammates.New ability. (Possible a new ultimate or a normal ability with long cooldown like Mercy Res)-Hard Light Prison: Symmetra can lock an enemy and take it out of the fight for ""X"" seconds. This enemy cannot die or recieve damage, but count as a ""stun"" so if the enemy is ulting, it will lose the ultimate. The idea of this is make something like in Heroes of the Storm, something like the stasis effect, you become invulnerable, but also you can't do nothing. So, again, Symmetra has a way to stop DPS or enemies, giving her team the time needed to fight back, regroup and other things.As I said before, I hope someone with better ideas than me, build a better concept. And of course, if they put more utility or abilities on her, they need to nerf or change her weapon, that's is something that probably will happen, but I think it can be a good change, nerf her DPS (not to much) but increase her utility in general to help her team to stay alive and stay in the fight, and also be viable as a second support.Well, tell me, guys, what you do think about my ideas, and please, if you have another ideas, just say it, let's dream and think ways to improve Symmetra and also balance her.","

I feel like taking away her ability to gain ult charge from health packs is a little harsh for the trade off.I feel like to counteract that I think that they could give some ult charge from the initial hack of the health pack (Like 2-3%?) but she can't keep rehacking it while it's still hacked to keep gaining ult charge. This would encourage players to hack more than one health pack & create more deniability.However this could maybe make her a little too strong.,"

"Soldier 76 honestly needs burst fire to counter certain characters that he already should've been countering.Pharah is the biggest problem when it comes to soldier. A good pharah versus a good soldier will equate to soldier 76 dying quite quickly due to the fact that pharah's dps is quite big compared to soldier's dps and the fact that his bullet spread is quite large and puts him at a large disadvantage when fighting pharah, a hero he is supposed to counter.all it takes is two direct shots or even three splash shots from pharah and soldier has to land 10 or more shots, not accounting for falloff damage and headshots.he should be given an option to change his gun's fire mode to burst fire to help him battle at longer ranges, I believe this will help soldier 76 in the long run.","

"As an avid Soldier player. This is quite frankly wrong in a lot of ways. Burst fire for Soldier is the wrong direction. The idea of soldier is that he's a jack of all trades, master of none. He can do everything, but nothing exceptionally. Giving him burst negates that fantasy. A good soldier consistently shuts down a Pharah, she's playing differently because of a Soldier? Well, he's doing his job then isn't he? If you're in long range and getting 2 shot by Pharah then you're doing it wrong, the rockets are easy enough to avoid. If you're having issues with bullet spread, trying using his gun like an M16 and firing 5 bullets and letting the spread calm down. Soldier does have to land more shots than Pharah does, but thats because they're individually a lot less powerful?He's fine as he is now. As much as I would love for him to have 20 bullet damage again, it's probably not going to happen. Or anything for a very long time.","

"this hasnt been what I've been experiencing for as long as i've been playing the game, especially when i was pretty good with him. When pharah starts focusing you down, there isnt much you can do if the pharah is good. In lijiang tower control center, if you and her are both at point, she'll beat you. Because she'll focus you down then the rest of your team because you'll have to focus on the enemy team as well since you're grounded. only way I'd say that pharah gets shut down consistently is if they're bad at pharah and just divert attention from you to another hero. because if she focuses you down, you cant do much without hiding behind a rein shield, and at that point, she'll just duck out of the way due to the fact that you'll get free shoots on her. Dodging the rockets are indeed easy, when they're coming from across the map. However, if she's above you, or fighting along in a team fight while flying above her team, those rockets are quite hard to dodge unless you're literally gonna run around sprinting to avoid them due to the fact that its splash damage is quite large. And if you're gonna run around, you're not participating in the team fight, and you become quite vulnerable to pharah because you're not fighting back, unless you get into a roofed area. also im not saying perma change how his gun fires with no alternatives. Im just saying give an ability that changes how the gun fires that you can swap between.","

Last I heard about a support character being used to take down a very powerful hero, it was called bad game design.AKA using zen on roadhog.No one called that !@#$ before he got nerfed down for absolutely no reason.>mccreeGl with that fall off damage, dodging those enemies that'll also focus you along with pharah that'll uber focus you the whole game due to the fact that she recognizes you countering her efficiently.>anaAna is a pretty strong healeryou're chosing to be a DPS healer. Thats a sketchy choice. You can chose to focus pharah, try to get those three to 4 shots on her depending if she has a pocket mercy or not. This is also assuming you have a second healer besides the ana to heal your team as they fight the enemy team.>zarya and dvaI thought blizzard Hated dps tanks and called them OP. but tbh, zarya doesnt counter pharah unless she drops low. her right clicks are too awkward to try and aim properly because they have an arc and you'll also have to be ignoring your team as a cooperative tank that shields her team mates when they need it/you need it, which at that point,you shouldnt be doing that. Dva is a weird pick as well. she's more dps focused now. Dva can take down pharah if she doesnt have a mercy with her that is. the DPS she offputs during her flying, shooting, and missiles gets outhealed and pharah somewhat survives, especially if she decides to do something other than float, maybe boop off of u or simply fall to the ground and disrupt the projectile missiles from hitting her constantly. >torbjornThe fact that you had to bring up torbjorn and his auto-aim turret to argue as a counter is not good. because in all team pushes, the pharah will auto focus down that turret due to the fact that it'll be a detriment to the push, then she'll focus down whoever else can counter her after she destroys the turret in 3 direct shots.>hanzoBroken as all hellIS he a sniper, A close range attacker, a mid range shooter?He's all of them plus close up protection, He's good for countering pharah when you're good with him because he's broken left, right, up and down. highly mobile, High dps, instant counter to whoever gets too close, big AOE ult.Lets look at who I said is the one true pharah counterMoiraConstant, long range dps that can heal herself with health balls and damaging enemies.","

Cuz I'm pretty sure omnics are androids with a namesake to the corporation who made their most renown predecessors.

An artificial biological human as a character would be new ground though and I think it’d be pretty cool. Certainly not outside the realm of possibility for the science in the Overwatch universe.Maybe something more along the line of the OP would be a story about some Omnics getting augments to look fully human, exploring all the consequences of that on both the human and Omnic sides. Would make for a neat comic.","

When is mei getting a buff. Her state in the game is critical. Because a pro can play her well does not mean she is in a good state. She has minimal impact on a game. Most characters that are way easier to play has way more to offer. Their is NO reason to main mei. I love playing her but she is just so weak. Blizz also does not care about mei at all. Even someone like symmetra means more than a mei. The only thing a mei can do is stall. NOTHING more. You need to be a god to land her ult fire consistantly and it has fall off.

She also has a lot of survivability, being able to use cryofreeze to regain all of her health. The issue with mei is that she is easily shut down at range.

Also there's a need of an antiflanker hero: Mei is supposed to be that hero but she's not powerful enought to do that job unfortunally, because in the past players didn't knew how to counter her and asked to nerf her, but with time players discovered how to counter her, and devs forgot to balance her and leaving her in F tier.I explain more things in the Meigathread: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759356748","

What's your dpi & sens anyway? your sens probably make your aim pixel skipping.For tips all I can say is focus on your targets & their movement rather on your crosshair. Doesn't mean you don't need crosshair but crosshair is a helping tool to make sure your target is in the middle of your screen. There was a post about aiming tips that told to turn off crosshair & start focusing on the target by putting them in the middle of the screen. It trains your brain & works about an hour.,"

"I've been thinking about this a lot since I was in the same situation. What you have to take into account is that you ""shoot from the hip"" in Overwatch (unless you play Widow). In Battlefield when you aim down sight, your sensitivity is slowed down ALOT, so when setting your sensitivity in Overwatch you have to usually lower it like crazy, in order to have the same as as you did in those games.Also, a thing to consider is that Overwatch is overall a faster game than Battlefield, targets move in general alot faster, so a 144hz screen could be an option here, however when you set the sensitivity lower (it should be lower than you think, atleast if you look at pros), then you will improve alot.For Widow and Ana I recommend you set the ""zoomed in sens"" to 38-50, personally mine is at 50.I don't think you need the sensitivity of Ryujehong (it's the lowest I've tested, 77cm mouse movement to turn 360degrees), but Taimous is pretty good for most characters.

"Overwatch is mostly hip-fire aiming and characters move much more erratically compared to other games. There's a lot of vertical movement, strange janky movement like Blinks/Dash, and ADAD is really strong as well. In other games you're usually trying to hit small but predictable targets, while in OW you have a bunch of zippy Tracers and Mercies jumping around everywhere.It's also very possible you don't have a proper sensitivity setup. Maybe you play with one sensitivity that feels good in BF/COD, but in OW you happen to have the wrong value.If you wanna get used to hipfire aiming more, there are a lot of good programs for it. I use a combination of Aim Hero, Aimtastic, and KovaaK's Aim Trainer, which are all <10$ (Aimtastic is free). I use Aim Hero mostly for its Reflex mode, but Aimtastic is also a good option. KovaaK's Aim Trainer gives you moving bots, which can also help you apply your muscle memory to a proper moving target.","

COMP is not the only mode in this game. and if she is not good enough to be at your level in comp then you need to abandon her in comp and play over in QP or the arcade. stop trying to paint a turd gold. your smurfing at levels you shouldnt be at to play with her. if her skill was anywhere as good as yours she would be at your level oviusly shes not. so learn to enjoy the other game modes. and stop poisoning the lower ranks with your smurfing there just so you can play with her. or dont play overwatch with her and play some game that you are not going to ruin for others by being in low level comp matches with a smurfsmurfs are garbage beucse there playing at a low rank level that thy do not belong in. there purpusly playing in these low ranks to be toxic and poisonus to the game play in them. there doing it for there own kicks not careing what there doing to other players that are trying to have fun in the game and trying to do something. see previus posts. smurfs are not only the bane of nearly all games that have a ranked system in them there also toxic players that make the community toxic by smurfing as thy do. thy know what there doing when there going into a low rank silver or bronze match. thy know there doing it to piss off and upset the low ranks and thy do it for there own jollys.

It's almost just going through the paces, and a game should never ever feel that way.I dunno.

"I have so many quick play games where:* our team composition is really bad, for instance we got 2 snipers on offense, the enemy team destroys us, and when I ask them to change I get the answer ""who cares, it's just quick play"".* people are fighting each other in chat, which makes them focus more on chat than actually playing the game (I see them standing in place writing their long message instead of going with me on attack), and when I tell them to focus on the game they answer ""it's just quick play"".I'm not sure how to phrase my question, but does quick play look to you guys (Blizzard devs) like a (sorry for the expression) !@#$-hole where you don't have to care about the other players in your own team and act like an egoist with the supreme automated answer to all complains - ""it's just quick play"" ?This doesn't sit right with me, even if it's 'just' quick play.I'd like to see Blizzard let all players know that quick play is not a %^-* mode where you can do whatever you want.How? maybe add some bold new warning text to quick play inside the game? I don't know.p.s- I don't plan to reply other users who has different opinions here, I'm only interested in Blizzard's view (and hopefully a change) on this issue.Thanks.","

"Honor SystemBasically a system where players have the option (not mandatory) to give a positive rating on a player. Players that queue in a group together can't give honor to each other, only the random players from match making, this prevents boosted honor. Honor Options are as follows:Good Communication - Player communicates flankers, targets, ult management, ult combos, counters, and some strategy.⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ Good Leader - Player communicates effective strategy to their team, communicates ult synergy, tactics, and announces initiation on fights or reseting/regrouping. ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ Flexible Team Player - Player is willing to communicate and work with others for a better starting team composition to great benefit.⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ Positive Player - Player continues to be a positive example to the team, even in difficult times. Player continues to compliment others on great plays, and is overall friendly to those in game.⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ These are just a few suggestions. The great thing about this, is players can scroll over the players name and see what the player is known for. There may be a leader in your group, and this system may help enable him/her. Also, this Honor system may encourage others to be less toxic, or become a more positive players. Players can choose to hide their positive rating if they so choose (in case they don't feel like being a leader that day for whatever reason). Not only this, a system like this could also encourage players to try other roles such as support and tank, because they are likely to get a higher honor rating. I do think the Honor System should reset every season, this way it encourages players to continue to be positive every season (they have to regain their positive reputation every season). Having it reset also means that you won't have someone who starts off being positive, but then later becomes toxic, having being stuck with undeserved positive rating. Also the Honor system can reset for those that are banned by the report system, that way they don't keep their positive rating if they grief/throw/ or are abusive in chat.The Honor System will promote continuous good behavior.Furthermore, simple rewards such as sprays or voice-lines such as ""Honor is it's own reward"" for some of your favorite heroes could go a long way. Please note, this is not a new idea. Forum Users have been asking for this for over a year if not more. These are some threads that also have great ideas about the topic of an Honor System. They are worth reading, but not worth necroing.

If a player has Honor, then something might not look right, and this could help Blizzard in looking deeper into a possible false-flag. It may not prevent errors, but it could help.*edit* Addressing new concerns:But RichC, can't friends boost each-other with honor?The best solution for this is to NOT allow people you are grouped up to give you honor. If you are already grouped, it means they think you are already honorable enough to want to group. The system would be in place for all those who aren't grouped together. For example, if you duo queue, then the person you are duo-ing with can't give you honor and you can't give them honor, but the other 4 people can give you honor and you can give them honor.This is because the game is promoting honor with RANDOM people that you are thrown together with (which could help with solo queuers).Also to add, this Honor System is a way to finally formalize people who Answer the Call (people who want to be the best team player they can):https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759371908Will the Match Making Balance teams around Honor?No. I don't believe it should, I think the Honor System should be kept as a simple tool to help promote a more healthier, friendlier gaming environment. Plus, I would want to see this system implemented asap, and trying to code an Honor System to the Match Making sounds like a lengthy nightmare.","

"They could honestly copy many MMOs systems where you get a free fame/defame point per day, and can award it to someone to increase someone's fame or defame rating. If someone has 20 fame, and you defame them, they go down to 19. If someone has no fame and you defame them for being toxic, they go to -1. The system polices and regulates itself and afte ra while you will have a generally clear representation of someone's popularity, toxicity, and kindness/usefullness to team all wrapped up in a single number. It sounds counter-productive but it actually works fairly well. If the system is in place for a few months and you see someone with zero or negative one or two fame, then you just pass them off as a random person with no real consequence. If you see someone with 300 fame, then you know they are a really good human being, and if you see someone with -25 then you know they are generally unsavory. It encourages positive behavior, lest you get a 'scar' on your image, which can only be reversed with good actionsNote: the game I play that has this system makes it so you cannot upvote or downvote the same person more than once a month, to prevent mindlessly upvoting your friend and they upvoting you over and over again to boost your stats","

"I see no possibility for negative impact on the game with this suggestion and only benefits.Couple stipulations should be in order to avoid some shenanigans and encourage positive play. 1. People on your friends list cannot give you positives.  This is to help prevent manipulation by larger groups of friends and players.2. Needs a ""Good Sport"" option for honor so that enemy teams can also give positive votes to players who were good sports regardless of outcome.  This would encourage  positive interactions between opponents as well as teammates.","

I would have it so that people you are grouped with can't give you honor, only random people that you are randomly thrown into with the system. This would prevent boosted honor. For example, if you are in a duo or trio, you can only give honor towards the people who didn't queue with. 2nd. I personally don't think there should be rewards for something like this, unless they were really REALLY subtle, like an HONOR spray. To offset the concern about people growing toxic toward the end of a season, give honors during the middle of the next season, or at a random time. Personally, I think the system should not have rewards, having recognition of your honor would be enough for those that are honorable.","

"you do realize that nothing but her ult changed right her kit more or less the same considering you could in fact build you can build your ult in 30 seconds as 1.0 is this a nerf from mercy 1.0 yes absolutely but she was in fact OP cause you don't really give a the base healer most consistent healing and most powerful ult and pls don't bring up ""oh mercy was a troll pick in tank meta"" but ana got nerfed so what would 1.0 be like today it would go down like the whos mercy could rez the most and another argument is people think that killing the mercy or hack the mercy is counterplay it's not though because counterplay shouldn't be based off stockpiling ults for push and for when mercy rezs that's the worst way this game could go. and support ult had counterplay lucio could get interrupted mid ult and killed now and zens ult is completely garbage if anti naded mei could wall off nano boosted targets and freeze them making the ult useless mercys old ult had nothing no cast time to interrupted no getting Los check no(even if it did Los wouldn't change much) that ult was the biggest team fight winner in all of this game and give the easiest healer the best heals per sec and best ult of all the supports that is against what balance means","

"Ummm, higher damage will make her very oppresive especially with turrets. Just because it is not aimlock doesnt make her any less op. The reason pro dont use her offensively is because she cant engage and that is becauze she is not designed to engage in combat - she is a defender. Increasing skill cap with higher damage will make her too op with turrets. In another words, a less tanky but very powerful zarya that can hold choke with extra buffed turrets. Either that she will still stand at the back and cant do anything until enemy step into her nest but with the multi mobility heroes, she will still get dived pretty hard from the backline.Her usefulness is still limited to 1st point cp in closed map against slow comps and with at least 2 healing heroes.","

Now im not saying that they shouldnt play i mean everyone has to start somewhere but i have multiple matches where we have 3 of these people on my team and the enemy team has 4 people who are prestige and have played from beta till now. It seems really unfair that in both comp and quick the matchmaking places us with people who have no rank, low lvl, and they get pissed and quit out and leave us to lose. I love playing this game but you guys really need to change matchmaking so that we get matched with people who play at our lvl/rank otherwise we get screwed on our placements and the game becomes a lot less fun because we have to full on carry matches and still lose. I understand that this is a team game but not all of us can be cloud 9 with a full 6 man team every single day that takes the game seriously, a lot of us including myself are purely solo players and it sucks to get a placement in comps that is super low because you had 4 matches where half your team quit because they are low lvls who have no idea how to play and then rage quit.","

milestone higher because of the mobility it provides]D.va:Damage done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/5,000,000Damage absorbed: 750,000/1,000,000/2,500,000Self-Destruct eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,0000[Notes: Encourages D.va to Defence Matrix high bursts of damage more often, Self-Destruct milestone more lenient since D.va ult is static and easily escapable]Doomfist:Damage done: 750,000/1,000,00/2,500,000Rocket Punch eliminations: 1,000/5,000/7,500Meteor Strike eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,000[Notes: Meteor Strike milestone is more leniet because of its easy escapability, Doomfist's damage is considered inconsistent by many, damage milestone adjusted]Genji:Damage done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/4,500,000Deflect eliminations: 1,000/7,500/25,000Swift Strike eliminations: 1,000/7,500/25,000Dragonblade Eliminations: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: Since Genji is an effective offense hero his milestones are higher]Hanzo:Damage done: 500,000/750,000/1,500,000Scatter Arrow eliminations: 1,000/5,000/10,000Dragonstrike eliminations: 5,000/10,000/15,000[Notes: Hanzo's ult and Scatter Arrow are both effective at eliminations, milestones raised accordingly]Junkrat: Damage done: 2,500,000/5,000,000/7,500,000 Enemies trapped: 1,500/2,500/4,500RIP-Tire eliminations: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: Junkrat's DPS is very good, damage milestone adjusted accordingly, RIP-Tire is highly mobile, high damage ult, so I've put it on par with Dragonblade]Lucio:Healing done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/5,000,000Environmental eliminations: 500/1,000/2,500Shields provided via Sound Barrier: 2,500,000/5,000,000/7,500,000[Notes: Lucio's Sound Barrier provides 500 health to all teammates including himself, which is why the milestone for it is set so high]McCree:Damage done: 750,000/1,000,00/250,000,000Enemies stunned: 1,000/2,500/5,000DeadEye eliminations: 1,000/5,000/10,000[Notes: Since DeadEye is easily blockable and escapable I decided to make the milestones lower] Mei:Damage blocked with Ice Wall: 750,000/1,000,000/2,500,000Health regenerated with Cryo-Freeze: 750,000/1,000,000/2,500,000Enemies frozen: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: enemies frozen relates to enemies frozen by both Mei's primary fire and her ultimate]Mercy: Healing done: 2,500,000/5,000,000/7,500,000Teammates resurrected: 2,500/5,000/10,000[Notes: Mercy as a strong single target healer makes large amounts of healing, which is the cause for her high healing milestone, recent nerfs to Ressurect has made it difficult to pull off, with a long cooldown of 30 seconds the milestone was lowered]Moira:Damage done: 750,500/1,500,000/2,500,000Healing done: 1,500,000/2,500,000/3,500,000[Notes: the healing done milestone is harder to encourage a supporting Moira instead of a battle Moira playstyle]Orisa:Damage blocked: 250,000/500,000/1,000,000CC resisted with Fortify: 500/1,000/5,000Environmental eliminations: 250/500/1,500[Notes: Orisa's environmental eliminations are harder to pull off then Lucio's, which is why is it lower]Pharah:Damage done: 1,500,000/2,500,000/5,000,000 Environmental eliminations: 1,000/2,500/5,000Rocket Barrage kills: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: Pharah has similar damage to Junkrat, reduced because Junkrat has mines and traps to help his damage dealing, increased environmental eliminations as they're easier to pull off than Lucio]Reaper:Damage done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/4,000,000Health absorbed: 250,000/500,000/1,000,000Death Blossom kills: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: Reaper's good DPS means his milestones for damage are high, but since his only damage output his primary fire the milestones were reduced]Reinhardt:Damage blocked: 1,000,000/2,500,000/5,000,000Enemies stunned by Earthshatter: 5,000/10,000/15,000[Notes: Reinhardt's large shield healthpool means the damage blocked milestones have to be big]Roadhog:Enemies hooked: 5,000/10,000/25,000Health recovered with Take A Breather: 250,000/500,000/1,000,000Whole Hog eliminations: 5,000/10,000/15,000[Notes: all and all, balanced milestones for Roadhog]Soldier 76:Damage done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/5,000,000Healing done: 250,000/500,000/750,000Helix Rocket eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,000Tactical Visor eliminations: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: Since S76 is mobile and has a high damage output when ulting his milestone is higher]Sombra:Damage done: 750,000/1,000,00/2,500,000Health packs hacked: 5,000/10,000/25,000Enemies hacked: 5,000/10,000/25,000[Notes: EMP'd enemies and health packs count towards the hacking milestones]Symmetra:Turret eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,000Teammates teleported: 15,000/25,000/75,000Shields provided: 25,000/75,000/100,000[Notes: provided sheilds only count for teammates in range of the shield generator when it is placed, entering the generator radius after it's placed will not count towards the milestone]Torbjorn:Turret eliminations: 15,000/25,000/50,000Armor packs provided: 50,000/75,000/125,000[Notes: Torb's turret milestone is higher than Symmetra's since his turret does more damage at a longer range, more effective in general]Tracer: Damage done: 1,000,000/2,500,000/5,000,000Health recalled: 75,000/125,000/250,000Pulse Bomb eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,000[Notes: Tracer's high DPS means her damage milestone has to be high to balance it all out, Pulse Bomb is hard to use which is why it's a low milestone]Widowmaker:Damage done: 75,000/125,000/250,000Headshots: 2,500/5,000/10,000[Notes: I genuinely had no idea what to do for Widow, sorry]Winston:Damage blocked: 250,000/500,000/750,000Primal Rage eliminations: 2,500/5,000/10,000[Notes: The low damage of Primal Rage means that the milestone had to be low to balance it out]Zarya:Damage blocked: 1,500,000/2,000,000/5,000,000Enemies pulled by Graviton Surge: 15,000/25,000/75,000[Notes: Zarya's particle barriers are at 200hp each, meaning I had to double my original milestone]Zenyatta:Healing done: 500,000/1,000,000/2,500,000Discorded enemies killed: 15,000/25,000/50,000[Notes: Transcendence and Orb of Harmony both count towards healing done]How it works:Each hero's individual milestone has 3 tiers, with each set of milestones rewarding different skins for completion, all past stats do not count towards the milestones, reaching milestones also grants bonus XP, a spray and currency.Tier 1 is on par with a rare skin, a recolour of the default and 500 currency.Tier 2 is on par with an epic, changes to the default but still nothing special and 1,000 currency.Tier 3 is 3000 currency, alongside a completely unique legendary, something everyone will notice while playing to recognise you're achievement, dedication, perseverance and skill.Final note:Thanks for reading, this took me a long time to write out (3 hours to be exact), please leave your feedback and own suggestions, thanks :)","

"Enemies slept would have to be something like 75/150/225 given how infrequent Sleep Dart is (both in terms of cooldown, preventing wanton usage, and actually landing it on targets that don't stand still for 2 seconds).But yeah, that'd be a pretty good idea and would encourage completionists to play many characters instead of just a few. I'd include hours played (across all modes) too, like 5 hours, 10 hours, 15 hours... Keep in mind there are 26 Heroes and another 1 on the way, meaning it'd take over 400 hours of gameplay to reach the 3 time based milestones per character.All the milestones would have to be something that's reachable within 15 hours of standard gameplay imo. (Meaning bad gameplay = 30 hours, good gameplay = 7~10 hours)If you complete all the milestones, you get 750CP, 20000 XP, 750 coins, and a special spray. Like the character's Ult as the emblem with ""Don't Worry, I'm A Professional"" in their native language.More depth/prizes = better in the long run imo.","

"Before the post I wanna quickly say that if you don't wanna read the wall of text I have a video up where I say exactly what's typed here https://youtu.be/H1NktPGayncHi, so today I want to talk about CTF and specifically Competitive CTF, and how it can solve the golden gun issue the game still has for some reason. Golden guns were always meant to be a reward for playing in the competitive mode, but quickly turned into the only reason a lot of the more casual players (especially in the lower ranks) played competitive at all, solely for a golden gun. Jeff has came out and said the golden guns were his biggest regret and if he could, would remove them. Now I see a solution right infront of me, and it actually began back in the 2017 summer games event, when we had competitive lucio ball introduced. This gamemode was just lucioball, but it gave competitive points for playing it, and while it does give a lot less than regular competitive, at the end of the day you are still getting competitive points for playing an arcade game mode. Now, what I personally feel should happen is to have competitive CTF alongside the regular competitive seasons (well maybe CTF can be a little shorter but still) this way the casual playerbase can get the golden guns they always wanted, without going into an actual competitive environment, they can get golden guns by playing an arcade mode. This can work because while lucioball is tied to the summer games event, CTF has been turned into a permanent game mode. This solution could only seek to benefit because now everyone could have at least 1 golden gun, solving the crisis, and perhaps even get some of the casual players to give competitive a try if they like the competitive ranking aspect of competitive CTF. Thanks for reading give me your thoughs in the comment area maybe we can get a discussion going and if a lot of people like it maybe even a game director will notice.","

Anything you can't prove via video is still tricky.That aside I present a simple riddle:If a large (unknown number of) amount of reports doesn't get you banned automatically, then why are so many bans public and overturned?  If you can get banned based on report volume, how are such serial abusers able to play so long?Blizzard employs some of the greatest and most detail-orient programmers in the industry and as people I love them to death.  Unfortunately enough issues with the report system have been made public that they need to make a commitment.  Can bulk reports induce a ban automatically?  Whatever answer they choose presents a lot of explanation of past bannings.  It's not an easy decision but it's gonna have to be made.","

Blizzard should also bunch all the report vs 1 player together like they do now.  and if the first 2 evidence is condemning they can ban that player right there.  and if you have 50 report on a single player, but first 10 are all frivolous, you can pretty much toss out the other 40 reports.at the same time there are punishments to frivolous reporting.  and blizzard should increase the punishment to include game time ban as well.","

"So...I used to be in Masters rank months ago. but i've been taking a long break of comp because of throwers and triple/quad DPS teams (the DPS problem still hasn't changed). i've just been doing placements until this season. because of that i decayed to platinum. i decided that since i was less than 200 SR i would try to climb to diamond for some extra Cp. Turns out...it's not that simple...The teams i've been getting all damn day are AWFUL. i know this could be a ""maybe it's just me"" issue, and i admit i made some bad plays...but good god it's definitely not me. My teammates keep getting killed over and over again, as in they don't group up. they go off on their own and just die. When an enemy is low they, more often than not, can't finish them off. of course i know that's normal, but it's never been this bad in the Masters range. I keep getting silver or gold elims, sometimes i don't get a medal but i do my part, but i just can't get a win with the teams im getting. i used to be platinum during season 2 and early season 3, but i was NEVER this bad. what the heck happened?","

It enforces players compliant to game rules while letting everyone plainly to see that Blizzard is actively working against abuse as punishment is being issued in real-time in front of all the players in the game.You don't need an army of marshals to police 30 million players.

"02/13/2018 05:39 AMPosted by HossirInstead of counting purely on the community to counter toxicity through the use of the reporting system, a hidden in-game marshal could be implemented to improve the overall OW experience.An in-game marshal can issue an insta-ban when bad behavior is observed.  It is one thing to fear being reported for being toxic, but it is much more psychological when players are being warned that the authority is randomly monitoring the game.  It enforces players compliant to game rules while letting everyone plainly to see that Blizzard is actively working against abuse as punishment is being issued in real-time in front of all the players in the game.You don't need an army of marshals to police 30 million players.  Just a few to make an example out of a few bad players and the community would get the message to play nice.Nah, blizz should just send their SWAT teams to break kneecaps of toxc players.","

"I'm against one-tricking heroes that are intentionally developed to be situational picks. This is because when they're not used in the correct situations, they're basically a throw pick. No matter how hard you try, or how good you are at that hero, it's a throw pick when you're actively being countered to the point of not achieving anything but feeding the enemy team.Having said that, the problem here lies in the fundamentals of how the matchmaker works. At it's core, the matchmaker assumes that everyone is going to work together. Making team compositions that try to complement each other, and coordinate to execute strategies.That is where the entire thing falls apart. If you join a game late, and the only hero you're good at playing is Soldier, but someone already picked him.... Well, you're now going to be basically throwing regardless of what you pick if that person won't swap with you. However that person may be in the exact same boat. It's a lose-lose scenario. Some skills may transfer to other heroes, but you won't be nearly as effective on them.This a failure of the matchmaker being able to read our minds, and put us into our ideal groupings every time. That is to say, the matchmaker will always be flawed so long as it tries to match us up together blindly. Without knowing what we want to play, and what we want to play with, it will always have a very high chance of leaving people upset.I don't think it's right for someone to queue up, and intentionally ruin the game for 11 other players just so they can play a hero that innately sucks for the map they're on. However, I also don't think it's entirely their fault. If Blizzard is allowing them to do it, then it's Blizzard's fault. I think it's time we admit to being mad at Blizzard for this, rather than taking it out on the players. If the system enticed players to group up, then those who just want to ruin a game for 11 other people would find their queue times sky rocketing. While everyone else would find a group, and play within seconds.","

For Bedouin and Nomad the shurikens should be blue.For Sparrow the shurkins should stay green.For Young Genji they should be red.EDIT: Due to feedback, I realize that Genji isn't the only character with ""color errors"" for lack of better words. In my opinion each legendary skins should have similar particle effects accordingly. I know this would be asking for a lot of cosmetic reworks, but it would be a great feature to Overwatch.The only downside i see to this is if there were multiple Genjis with different skins, confusing players with the differently colored shurikens.Feedback encouraged.","

I don't know about you guys but I liked the fact nano boost used to be one of the most powerful ults. It allowed heroes like Reaper and Rein to shine and overall allowed the ult to be more dextrous rather than simply giving it to a Soldier or Genji to combo with their ults.I'm not saying it's terrible in its current state but it feels kind of overkill in a lot of situations. I liked the fact it could be applied to a lot of heroes with out need for using another ult with it.Possibly reverting it to it previous state might be too powerful so maybe reducing the damage or not giving it the max speed it used to have might be the way to go.,"

"Since Summer Games 2017, we had the confirmation that seasonal events will drop every year. They might recive some adjustments and changes, but the main core of the Arcade modes stays. Winter Wonderland 2017 tho came with a brand new game mode, Yeti Haunt. It broke our expectations on having the same snowball Mei game, and it was good.So my question is:Will the seasonal events (Uprising, Summer Games, Halloween Terror, etc) come with new game modes like the last Winter Wonderland? Or will they come with a reworked but already implemented game mode?The Lunar event came with a reworked Capture the Flag mode, and Summer Games too, which is not that bad but this game has a lot of potential in terms of Arcade games and would love to see new modes.

Realistically I think SR is more of a range than a fixed number, because luck of the draw with teammates is involved. Just feels super bad to go from your highest potential to your lowest potential when you have a string of bad luck. Should probably limit my number of losses per session if I truly want to keep climbing (2 losses means turn the game off) but I don’t, I just lose/gain massive chunks at a time.","

"I reached diamond for the first time end of last season, having been stuck in plat for a bunch of seasons (I think since season 3). Then this season, I ranked in at 2800 something, rose to 2999 in the first 24 hours, then life made me tilt and I dropped all the way down to high gold for the first time since season 3.So I took a deep breath and rethought things. First, I recognized that life was tilting me. I'm not a toxic player, so that never expressed itself in toxicity to my team. But, when you run into toxic players, you can either raise the morale of the team and counter the toxicity with positivity, or it can add to your pre-existing tilt and you can go down with them and start doubting victory. As a D.va player, doubting victory means trying to take things into your own hands and becoming far too aggressive. Diving in and losing mech over and over again because you're sure if you don't kill them your team won't.Committing to a fight after 2 of your team including Mercy are dead. Trying to contest a point on king of the hill when everyone else is dead and you should be too. With self-destruct granting a free mech, this is easily the worst danger on king of the hill. Enemy is at 60% now from the first fight, and you're STILL on the point as your team cycles in and out and you're never able to tip it even though you've been contesting the entire match.Anyways, I calmed myself. I made a conscious effort to call out when a fight is lost and it's time to die, less for my team than me but certainly my teams needed that call too. I began to take responsibility for the morale of the team, defending off-meta players and one-tricks in spawn and reminding people of Sun Tzu's Art of War: an army that outnumbers its enemy ten to one will still lose if it has the worse morale and does not believe in its ability to win. It is proven that people perform worse under pressure when their self-confidence has been destroyed. It's proven that armies fall apart, lose cohesion, stop pushing as a unit and have disorderly retreats when their morale has collapsed. We've all seen this happen in our games.You need to take a step back and reflate your morale, so you can raise the morale of your team.I'm now back to the 2700s after having dropped to 2450 or so from 2999. It wasn't easy, and I still have to remind myself of these things, as well as taking a break after my second loss in a row to not allow demoralization to set in. But it has helped me a lot, and I hope it helps you. Inspire yourself, and inspire the troops, and you will win a lot more games.","

With that said, if anyone ever asked we let them join.3. Finally, my group of guys is family and friends. One of them in particular is not a very good player.

I got a 10 minute ban and lost 60 SR for it, i understand losing and id be fine with losing SR for the loss, but is there any way I can do something about this?

Yes I do enjoy the mode quite heavily. Team roles are more prominent. Poor hero choices and plays are clearly and severely punished. Teamwork is more commonly and openly accepted in the game. I have had players actually voting and discussing tactics ingame knowing that one team needed to be at multiple points on the map. I have seen remarkable plays from single heros with much less piggybacking than in other modes. I could actually sit down and joke with other players for hours on end.If a stomped happened it was well deserved and dorsn't feel too much like we've been cheated out of it. Even the whole unbalanced Lucio wallriding exploit is going to be nerfed and did have a clear counter to stop him from speeding pass everything in sight from flag to flag. Which is Symmetra.O meta heros are considered amazing choices while the solo carry heros that rule the current comp scene are considered more niche adding a flavor I have never experienced in this gane. This new mode is amazing and the work is showing.Theres epic plays to be had rather than rolling a team over and over again or getting rolled ourself. Even the sudden death matches feel so exciting to get into know tat one mistake could cost us the entire game. Which I'll add the amazing epic comeback an enemy team almost completed against one of my own teams. We have two flags up in 4 minutes into the match. At the last second on overtime the enemy team stole our flag and teamwiped us. Figuring it wasn't such a big deal we played it off like overtime would end. Yet it didn't the enemy team diasy chained the flag capturs md scored a second point. The carrier scored while the rest of his team kept us at bay and they almost managed to scored a third flag. All in overtime. Thus forcing sudden death. They actually turned the game around with effort and teamwork. Which no other mode gives us right now.","

"A few ideas, Not saying I'd want all of them but a couple would be nice.Can fix and upgrade the turret at the same time with hammer (this would be more for if I got none of the other changes)Can fix buildables by other heroes. Right now this would basically just be Orisa's ult (I doubt he'd get a hammer to Junk's) but its a little more utility that will increase if we get more builders.Other things to build like a jump pad, scrap generator or a small armored barrier he can drop for team cover.A rework to how upgrades and buildings work so that he can have a total of 3 buildings in the game with upgraded things counting as 2. In ultimate the total jumps to 4 and he unlocks giving things a level 3 upgrade.My dream would be his shift turns from turret into a build menu where he can select from a few items and can have multiple items down from this menu at once. He can't just have 3 level 2 turrets as each count as 2 but can have a level 2 and something else, 3 level one turrets in various spots or some other combination of things. I feel this would increase his utility and make him less about just getting that level 2 turret up as he gets more play options and the level 1 turret would now be actually useful by placing more of them to over more spots.","
							 (Edited)

"He should have 3 different modes that can be used individually that each have their own abilities and play styles. The 3 that I came up with are called Defender, Denier, and Destroyer.Defender will have the usual armor pack that costs scrap. but it will have a barrier booster, the booster will be placed on the ground and will regenerate any shield around it. The effect will be upgraded when the building itself is upgraded, when Torbjorn ults the booster will double the strength of all barriers around it.Denier will have a land mine that acts like junk rats trap and concussion mine. It will be slightly hidden like his trap but instead of being detonated it will blow up when an enemy walks near it, while also notifying Torbjorn. The mine will have 2 charges so you can place 2 at any one time. He will also have an area denial fence. It will attach to two points at a time and will emit a laser that damages anyone who walks through it, it will do lots of damage to make it useful at denying entrance to a designated room. At level 2 it will emit two lasers. When Torb Ults it will double in health for the rest of its life time and it will turn off until someone walks into it, making it harder to see. When it is invisible. It will emit a faint light from both attachment points to make it slightly visible for people looking for it. This class is for denying entry to a health pack or a teleporter or for blocking off an entrance to the point you are defending.Destroyer will have a frag grenade that can be cooked and will apply slight bleeding damage to anyone affected by it. Its turret will be the exact same one it has right now. This class will be for solely dealing damage.His passive will auto generate scrap slowly and it will slowly regenerate Ironclad Armor.His Ultimate will be different than anybody else. At 50% charge he can use his ultimate to switch modes, when he does it will destroy any turret that is active. At 100% charge he can molten core and upgrade his active turret to level 3 as long as it is at level 2 already. It will act as it already is right now.","

"Nah not really, but the gap could be closed a little more than it is right now.  There are some heroes that have serious issues at both ends of the spectrum, and they need to be changed.  I think that is what everyone wants.For example, you can never balance a hero like widow across all tiers (she is obviously powerful in the pros, but in silver not so much).  However, there are a few heroes that could be changed slightly in such a way that their pickrate becomes closer to average at both the top and bottom.  (i.e. symmetra rework/changes)","

"No it isn't. When trying to balance around pros you can safely assume learn to play is not an issue, with casuals you cannot. Heroes being applicable in pro play means that they can be used given enough skill or that they are OP. Ideally you aim for the former. However this does mean you give random buffs until the hero is viable at pro level. That definitely creates issues. What you want to do is ideally increase the skill cap of heroes without also making them easier. That allows for trickle down balance which is the best balance type.Balancing around casuals who don't know counterplay or don't want to learn it is non-sensical. And even though a lot of people like to parrot this, proper balance around the pro level doesn't mean the rest suffer, it means the game has depth and the rest have room to improve. Note that I said proper balance, not the willy nilly buffs that come from the balance team sometimes","
						Feb 13
					",,,,,,,
"No, it isn’t possible. It’s hardly even possible to balance for the lowest percentile of players, due to there being so many random variables. 1 bronze player could think Bastion is OP because they don’t know how to counterpick, and another bronze player could be a Bastion main who thinks his hero needs a buff because he’s getting killed too much. At least in high tiers there is a general consensus on what’s good and what isn’t, and there aren’t any “l2p issues”. Balancing for both tiers at the same time is laughably impossible.","

"No. Absolutely a no from me. Simply put: casuals care much more for their fun and what they find fun than balance of the game. That's why when a hero counters a casual's main, they cry for it to be nerfed because it ruins their fun. They dont want to try, they want to have fun. Same with OP mechanics that are deemed as fun by the community. When those get changed/nerfed the reaction is the same: "" What about my fun?!""Pros on the other hand care much more for the balance of the game than their fun because they're paid to win, and they want the best tools to do so. Aka, the best/most balanced heroes and they're consistently giving feedback about balance so they have more tools to work with. Ie: How non-Mercy pro supports that couldn't keep up with playing just Mercy started making obvious mistakes in the pro enviroment. The best solution was to play their best hero to avoid errors- but with Mercy being overpowered, they simply couldn't.There can't be an in-between IMO, you either make characters balanced and hope the playerbase finds them fun, or you make characters fun and OP/UP and jeopardise the pro environment.","

"Hello everyone,I am a huge overwatch fan and follow esport intensively. I really linked the world cup which showed for the first time the new spectator mode (which is great!) but I could help but notice something that bother me.I think the fact that hero effect colors change with the team is a great tool for the spectator to understand which team does what capacity. But I think that some colors actually have a negative impact upon the leasibility of action instead of improving it. During the OW WC colors where mostly blue and red as we are used to see, but I find from the OWL preseason that some colors make the game not pleasant to observe as we are drawned in the color.2 Examples which make me say such thing: during the match LA Valiant vs SF Shock. The white spray coming out of Tracer guns make it absolutly confusing to observe. I felt like observing only this huge white flash when going into SoOn POV as Tracer.This problem appears in other situations which do not help readability, for instance the Houston Outlaws Green color makes Mercy healing beam going blue (which is supposed to be the damage boost). These two examples are only little part of the issue. I think that Zen'ultimate shouldn't be the same color as other abilities because we cannot distinguish abilities during team fights.That's why I think it would be great to give better look into the color shade of hero abilities for the spectator to fully enjoy the game :)Thank oyu for reading me, please let me know if some of you guys have had the same feeling than me. I'm a simple fan and even though the spectator system is great, I think it needs some improvement to make it perfect!

I'm trying to heal you I promise, but I can't do that if you guys scatter to all different points of the map! I also can't heal you if you don't even attempt to protect me when more than one guy shows up to kill me (because you flew off to mars).  I can get out of jams, but not a Tracer and Genji double team. TL;DR: Stay together.  Help your healers.  Stop leaving/throwing after minor setbacks.  I still have a lot of fun playing this game but the salt and derp are irksome at times","

"Firstly, I think they have ears, a brain might be a different question though... JK, kinda :PBut seriously, I can understand doing your own thing in QP, and as much as I find people 1v6ing there annoying, I know they are having fun, even if we have a lesser chance of winning because of it. But Comp? Seriously, i’m not one who barks orders, hell my mic is broken (I join voicecoms to hear people though) but why would you run ahead when you can see the 4 dead symbols by the point and no enemy deaths in the kill feed? Why do I bother putting down an Orisa barrier or pick Rein if you aren’t going to use the barrier. I believe I deserve to be at my rank, and when I get a team that works, it feels so fantastic! But then I get 6 or 7 matches in a row minimum where people don’t use barriers, if we even have a tank, run away from their healers and still expect to be pocketed, or try to 1v6 coz they think they are GM Gods here to ”Rek n00bs”?","

"The difference between QP and competitive:QP - People don't care what they pick, won't listen to teammates, and don't care about anyone but their own fun.Comp: People will pick full meta and say you're throwing if you don't, people still don't listen to teammates, communication like something as simple as letting your team to shout where the enemy widow or Mercy is, is like trying poking a dead horse and expecting it to get up.Basically, if I'm playing something competitively, I'm either doing it in a full group, or sticking to fighting games where competition exists solely on your own skill, and not relying on people that can't tell the difference between marmite and peanut butter.","

"too much dumb crap.  i even thought junkrats 2 mines where a little bit much.  nothing?  you add 1 more mine, and he can carry both at the same time.  yea ok, 2 buffs.  did he need 2 buffs?  do you not seperate buffs out by the plusses tehy get?anotehr problem we got here, is people keep claiming when they want to cry over their best in slot hero moira being nerfed or something is they keep insisting this is a RPG or Turn-based. Its not.  it takes skill.  moira takes no skill and is nothing but a spam fest.  AOE balls that are invincible.  at 50dps. 1 second of being near them gets you lost 50 damage.  Only tanks have a chance against her.  or a higher dps character like junkrat.  to scare her off more than anything.  plus she can invisible, invincible run away, once every 6 seconds.  sombra= she can cancel lots of moves with her hack, so thats better than an ultimate. i think she can even cancel ultimates. how?  being skillful?  she can hack and be invisible too and invincible.im standing there playing.  all of a sudden i cant use my abilities.  i turn around and am getting shot.  i look and sombras there, i cant use any of my abilities, heal, concusion mine. nope nothing.  i was just turned the other way, shooting at something, so now im sitting there trying to reload, to shoot at them, gettting shot. and now i run over to the health pack, oh thats hacked too. Shes too much crap.  i then try to pew pew my gun at her.  she starts taking damage, and invisibles invincibly away.  then gets me from another angle i wasnt looking in.  TOO MUCH.  CRAP.  too much invincibility in the game and invisibility now.  moira's aoe is too much, its invincible, it clears anywhere she wants to.  forces a team to be all together in one spot.  what if the healer dies?  this isnt a RPG where you die and retry again all over.  its the end of a match.  the point of this game has just turned into spam fest.  nothings fun.  remove fix unhack some stuff.  boringso kind of my point is they keep making new spam heroes crap, then they say they make up the excuse that to use teammates to take care of the problem.  no.  thats not an excuse.  i shouldnt have to yell at everyone else to deal with a game.  i dont care.  its spam, and haetver idea you claim the game is is a yell fest at everyone else to claim somehow that makes you better.  wow you alerted someone.  theres plenty of talk games, and this shouldnt be one.  your expecting everyone to spam their mic cybering, and give everyone every heads up about every thing around them in the game.  and 2nd part of that, noone knows whos talking its not showed in the 3d, i dont play on consistent servers, with consistent players.  so its recongnize someone then yell back and forth cyber with each other.no theres other games for that.  this isnt this game.  and its not an excuse to spam/overpower characters for whatever reason, then claim its use yoru teammates.  nothing is able to be done you guys claim in this game.  there are no real ""Modes"".","

AIM required.  so she should have to totally aim like ZARYA.  why not ? why is she not like that?that would even make it fairer.  orbs should be able to be shot down.  and last less length.  those are some thigns that could be done to fix thatsombra, make her bigger, i cant see her from a good distance away.  shes got this little sprinkle of bullets coming out and you cant see her.  and she disables everyting, yoru whole move set, can disappear and run around invincibly, theres too much invincible stuff in teh game now, moira and sombra added 4 FOUR new invisible invincible things.. running and teleporting, those are 2 each.moiras invincible orbs are 2 more one is for healing one is for damaging.  her non-aiming is another invisible aspect, attack. ok so i miscounted.  with the last 3 players there are now 8 items that are invincible or invisible.  not fair or fun tactics.need fixed or changed.  everyone can agree on that and noone can argue that thats fair or balanced.  so do something the games nothing but spam / dumb since.  just realized today that sombra ..oh yea gosh add her, hack the nearest health pack, teleport behinds you, hacks all your abilities, what do you do then?  they are somewher you didnt expect them.  plus nothing to do to defend yoursel fwith now.  and shes so small that at 50ft you cant even pick her out.  hard to hit too.i guess all those hacks makes a 9th invulnerable aspect from the last set of characters.  broke so boring.","

"I main Junkrat.  I have a few hours playtime on Moira too, just so I could get a feel for her.First off, balancing around Deathmatch aka FFA or for dueling purposes is outright stupid.  This game is balanced around team play.  Moira, by design as a healer support, shines best at burst healing deathball team comps.She doesn't need a nerf.  The whiners are people who are stereotypically, bad at playing against her.  She has counters, but they aren't mediocre players who main Tracer or Genji.   Moira is weak against long range heroes and people who know how to bait out her abilities.  She also can't out-self-heal high burst damage.  Heck, I can take out a good number of Moira's as Junkrat with the simple grenade/mine combo.  She's only got one shot at Fade and I've got two mines, so do the math.  Much like Junkrat, she's annoying and frustrating to play against.  She's also far more versatile, with the very high potential burst healing and mediocre but consistent DPS, but it seems that certain ""meta"" mains don't want anyone joining their little club/clique.","

Note: I'm not a Genji or Tracer main, I play support fairly often and yeah, Moira should be slightly toned down. Damage Orb is the primary culprit.

A skill with that little counterplay shouldn't be quite as strong as it is. It's damage should be toned down a tad.

If you play support and stay alone far from your team, so Orb deals full damage to you - it is not a problem of Moira, it is you are just bad at positioning. All Tanks simply eat Orb.

I'm really not sure why they gave Sombra a diving skin when Tracer is the one who wears the goggles.","

"They have said they have plans to fix Sym, Torb, Mei and Bastion (I believe).But what annoys me is this full time we are yet to see or hear what they have planned! There are so many things that can be with these heroes, but we are not seeing them. Sym has been a let down since launch. A character with infinite possibilities limited to 3 abilities. There should be some sort of builder stance where she can build more things i.e. a bridge (as seen in comics), a light dome (as seen in the comics),  and much more. Torb is a character that truly is in need of a full rework. I wish they would remove his turret, ult and armor packs. He needs justice. I have always found Torb to so underwhelming. I feel like Bastion has the easiest fix of all: Give him back his personal shield. Make it so that he has 200 clip, 10% less fire rate, but his shield back (600 hp shield). And make him transform into his ult way faster. Ana is a hero who is yet to be mentioned, but very underwhelming.

They go through numerous ideas and iterations for heroes. Some ideas may work, more likely than not nearly all don't. Fact is, very little of what they discuss or even test needs to be known by fanbase as it'll just lead to people thinking a change (or changes) are going to make it to live and further propagated by click-bait videos on YouTube. Fans overreact and that doesn't help the dev time one bit.","

"Edit: ^^ WhatupTransparency can be a double edged sword when it comes to development. As mentioned above, you can get feedback on what the community wants, but then you get premature speculation about its effect on the game. See Sombra's upcoming  changes and the threads already popping up about Pharah being made useless.There's also the risk of not being able to implement all proposed changes properly, so they get cut out changed. The best example of this are the Fable games. A lot was promised that ultimately didn't make it into the game because people got hyped and speculated.Keeping quiet is usually the most sensible thing because, sure, people get upset hearing nothing, and rightfully so, but this is usually forgotten once the changes are announced or implemented. An anticipated feature or change not making it in or not functioning as originally announced causes much more and longer lasting disappointment and anger.","

They go through numerous ideas and iterations for heroes. Some ideas may work, more likely than not nearly all don't. Fact is, very little of what they discuss or even test needs to be known by fanbase as it'll just lead to people thinking a change (or changes) are going to make it to live and further propagated by click-bait videos on YouTube. Fans overreact and that doesn't help the dev time one bit.God forbid they use their PTR like a real PTR","

Not every hero in the game needs to be nor should be difficult to play. They have a star ranking system for difficulty because not everyone is the same mechanically speaking. Like I’m a terrible sniper but I am capable of healing and positioning correctly. You shouldn’t have to play god tier level for every single character to be able to viable use a hero. Some heroes just should be easier than others. The higher skill heroes have more reward if you are good at them compared to lower skill heroes.,"

I have been Maining reaper for 3-4 seasons now on 4200+.He is really good on maps that have lots of buildings so he can reach the enemy without been seen.His main problem is if the team actually communicates he is predictable cause there are only certain routes he has to follow and some maps are really bad for him.First of all he needs his shadowstep to to be polished cause u spend 2 seconds to click where u want to tp cause it glitches. Secondly i would give him either some kind of smoke bomb or the ability to have range weapons for like 2 seconds or a grenade launcher.,"

All Reaper really needs is to boost the speed of his wraith form up by a bit or maybe boost his base speed up to Genji/Tracer numbers.

"02/07/2018 05:37 PMPosted by Jeff KaplanAlso, we don't agree with the statement that all supports are weak. Support heroes are extremely powerful and impactful in OW.I've been contemplating this quote by Jeff and I really have some conflicting feelings about it. And the more I think about it, the more I feel your perspective on the state of supports is determined by how exactly you define the word ""power"". After all, one has to have ""power"" to be ""powerful"" and ""impactful"".Does ""power"" mean able to influence the outcome of a match? Well if it does, then it stands to reason that this definition is ultimately a comparison statement. It begs the question: Do supports determine the outcome of a match relative to other roles?And to that question I'd have to say the answer is no. Tanks initiate fights and create space (to get kills). Supports prolong a fight (to get kills). DPS get kills. Ultimately speaking, the entire game comes down to getting kills. And because of this, I'd argue that DPS have far more influence than any other role. As long as you can get kills more consistently than your opponent, the other roles become unneeded. In other words, I cannot win a game by just holding space. I cannot win a game by just sustaining a fight. But I can win a game if I get kills more consistently than my opponent.To illustrate this, let's do a little thought exercise. Imagine if you had 2 full teams, each with one GM player and the rest Bronze. One team has a GM who is a support. The other team has a GM who is a DPS. Which team will win? If the matches continued with this little experiment, how do you think the win-loss records would look after 10 matches? 20 matches? 50? 100?My hypothesis: The team with the GM DPS player would win the overwhelming majority of the time. They have the ability to carry their team because the DPS has more influence in determining the outcome of a match.So if we want to define ""power"" as determining the outcome of a match, I'd say the favor goes to DPS.Notice that if we repeated the thought experiment with a tank GM vs. a support GM, the outcome between the teams becomes a bit harder to determine. But I'd be willing to bet that if it was tank GM team vs. a DPS GM team, you'd probably favor the DPS GM team yet again.All roles contribute to a victory, but not all roles are equal.Support are ""powerful"" in that they are virtually required to win a match. But I wouldn't go as far to say this makes them relatively ""powerful"" in comparison to other roles.This also addresses the argument that ""Support define the meta"". Well, yes. If the presence of a support is required, then they should influence a game built around team strategy and synergy. So perhaps you could argue that support are ""powerful"" in that their presence is required. But aside from very niche builds (like quad-tank for example), the presence of the other roles are required as well. So ultimately, I would call this a moot point.Aside from all this logic, I'd say that a significant portion of the support community feels that their relative impact on a match is rather limited and passive. And I believe that the developers should take note of this. If your support players don't feel ""powerful"" compared to other roles, why shouldn't they just play DPS?How many people play support because they want to, versus those who play the role because they have to?These are the questions I believe the devs should be asking themselves.And so I end this rather long post with the following: What does ""power"" mean to you? And are supports ""powerful""?","

"I would say they are in fact powerful.I would say that all rolls are equally powerful TBH.This is why so many people like 2-2-2 in solo queue comp.I think most would agree that if two equally skilled teams played each other and one team had two healers and the other had none, that the team with the healers would almost always win.They have significant impact on the game.

"The problem you would see if they made healers more DPS based is the current Moira situation of, “I have 5 golds” and constantly using right click instead of doing their role of keeping the teams health up. If everyone focused solely on dps and zero healing then you might as well play call of duty. Plus support roles in certain cases of Mercy, somewhat Moria and somewhat lucio is that you don’t need to have crazy good accuracy and can still be good at a game. You aren’t requires to generally have superhuman reflexes if you want to be a top level support. Ana and zenyatta are exceptions to that case considering aiming to them is much more important.","

Every role in Overwatch is hugely impactful, but for different reasons.  Because the DPS's job is literally to get kills, of course that the GM DPS team is going to win.  But if we take away this frankly extreme example, it becomes a bit less black and white.  Lunatic-Hai was one of the most successful Pro OW teams ever, and they never had the best DPS.  They were good, no doubt, but they played teams with a better DPS lineup.  The reason they won was their support play.  Ryujehong and Tobi are contenders for the best Ana and Lucio in the world, respectively.  They pulled off these insane plays, and were the stars of the team.  (Then they signed Fleta and became insane until the meta really swung against them)  In an even match, I would take a team with good support and average DPS over a team with good DPS and average support any day of the week.","

I'd say DPS and Supports are relatively even after that.This. Don't fool yourself into thinking DPS have the power because they are the ones landing killing blows. Tanks and Supports have an enormous impact on who lives or dies. Tanks control the field, and that's just too important in this game; they are the most powerful for sure. I also agree that supports/dps are roughly even in their impact.","

"If you don't have supports in your team but the enemy does, it is pretty much a lose for you. This is how much impactful the supports are. it is not some low amount of healing either. A support can get their team to full HP in no time and even outheal huge part of the damage when the person is getting shot.","

"Supports make or brake metas. If one support is better than others, all other heroes which have synergy with that support become more viable along with them automatically.","

Of course theyre powerful. Wtf?Try playing a few games with no Supports on your team and Supports on the enemy team. Let us know how they go.,"
						Feb 9
					",,,,,,,
"Supports are some of the most ""impactful heroes"" in the game, but not the best carry.>Does ""power"" mean able to influence the outcome of a match?I disagree with this completely. First off, if you don't have a support, you instantly lose the match. If you don't have dps or tanks, you can still win (even at a handicap).Also, supports make for the best shot-callers in the game. Communication/teamwork/knowledge are the most important skills in Overwatch - even more so than good aim.Ex. Say you're a GM widow with a 25% crit accuracy. If a GM lucio can convince + teach a team of bronze to go Winston + D.Va (even with bad aim), you can repeatedly dive that widow and force her out of the game.If they have a great Genji, you can teach your team to play quad tanks (which is, IMO the easiest comp in the game). Then, you go Moira + have your other support go lucio. Chances are, you're gonna steam-roll that genji.Zenyatta + Moira can also hard-carry a match. For example, in 1st point Kings Row, I flank as Moira. From there, I shoot an orb + beam at the nearest support. In the best case, I turn the fight into a 5 v. 6. In the worst case, I put a ton of pressure into the backline and escape without dying. In addition, Moira's pocketing ability is actually really, really crazy. With zen, you just need good aim + positioning. By out-aiming you opponent as zen, you can beat everybody except maybe sombra.> Ultimately speaking, the entire game comes down to getting kills. And because of this, I'd argue that DPS have far more influence than any other role. As long as you can get kills more consistently than your opponentOkay, but who prevents the dps from getting kills + helps your dps get more kills?For example, by damage boosting/pocket healing a dragonblading genji, you lets him 1-shot 200 hp heroes.Without good support, dps players have no space to work with. Without a good support, normal extension becomes over-extension really quickly. By healing them, you allow them to take risks that would otherwise be suicide.Supports are also amazing at pocketing, which is extremely important at high levels. Normally, if a Winston + D.Va lands on an immobile hero, then they're dead. Especially if they land on your other healer. However, if YOU have good positioning, you can actually keep them alive.Another point about pocketing - I don't care how good you are... You aren't going to kill a hero being pocketed by Ana/Mercy/Moira. Ex. Tracer does 120 sustained dps... Moira outheals 66 - 110% of that.There's a reason why this account is 3800 SR and my dps account is only 3400 SR.","

"I think that there are two competing notions of the word power here that are causing some confusion. The first meaning of powerful is that the has support/doesn't have support variable  has a strong correlation (or causal relationship) with the won team fight/didn't win team fight variable. In this version, having support players is almost necessary for winning fights, so they're powerful. I suspect that this is the version that Nightcrawler's post above me referred to. This version has its problems. I like the following thought experiment. Suppose you had a character with no abilities at all. No gun, no ult, no shift, no E. All they had is an aura that gave all friendly players 50% damage increase and 33% percent damage reduction. This character would certainly be a necessary pick: they enable more damage than a great dps, and they prevent as much damage as a main healer. But once you have one on both teams, their contributions exactly cancel out. This character meets the first definition of powerful, but you certainly wouldn't feel powerful playing them, especially if the other team had one too. A second way of thinking about power (which I think is more in line with what Azrael wrote) is that a character is powerful if their person decision making/skill has a strong effect on the chance of winning a team fight. You notice this form of power in a play of the game, or in a comments of the form - ""_____ carried that fight"" or ""we would have lost that fight if you hadn't _____"".  I would argue that this definition of power feels better for the player, and that this is what the dev's originally had in mind when they came out with the game. Some of the supports have the ability to do that via the dps route (Zen and Moira come to mind), and some have the ability to do it via the support route. I view the support route of swinging the fight as performing an action that allows a team mate/several team mates to live through something they had no business living through, and thus preventing a lost team fight. Transcendence/sound barrier come to mind here, as do the burst healing capabilities of Ana/Moira. In this sense, most supports are powerful, but as Azrael points out they might not be as powerful as dps. My issue is that in this definition, taking Jeff's context into mind, Mercy's ult is very unpowerful.","
						Feb 9

"Support ults are the most important ults to have in team fights.All support ults have their uses and function. Without them in teamfights, you can get wiped out easily by one enemy ult.Supports are strong, they have to be by nature","
						Feb 9
					",,,,,,,
"They are, because they provide assistance for dps to get their kills not just heals exclusively.Zenyatta's discorb for example gives an advantage to the team to take down targets faster. Moira can provide an extra damage to the opponents with her orbs so that her team can finish enemies quicker or use the ult to heal and damage. Ana provides extra strength to her team with the nano boost, a 1 v 1 of reinhardt will change outcome with one of them having nano boost. She also cancels healing on a target or cancels a target with sleep, so again gives advantage to dps.Lucio can boop people off completely off the map or make a tank hit stronger by speeding them up to their target. Mercy provides a boost on her kit and can maintain a lot of the heroes alive against most upcoming damage because of her great healing. In essence, all the supports provide a way to help their dps or tank do an even better job without them being the only essence of why, they define what team work is in the game.","

"They’re powerful but still dependent on the team doing well, maybe more than any other class. I know there’s a synergy between all of them but I don’t feel like supports turn the tides of battles that much... like yeah it helps but if your team isn’t already doing well what’s a whole lot of healing gonna do? Only the damage dealing supports have hopes of turning a battle in an actual tangible way. This is no hate on supports, I’m a support main. Maybe it’s because I’m in gold but I can have games where I feel like I healed like a rockstar but there was no coordination to capitalize. At least if DPS is doing well but the rest of the team is failing kills can still happen. They can still win a fight for the team (again I’m in gold so yeah this is exactly how it happens). It’s depressing playing support sometimes...","

Even if the game is ""balanced"" with the mmr/sr or whatever other gibberish are ""balanced"" between the teams, this still means that the majority of players on a team are having to go against some one who is much higher rank and skill level than ourselves, and even with this ""balance,"" not all of these high ranked players on each team play the same role or same hero, so the balance is extremely upset and the game is no fun.","

The more confident the opposing team, the more likely they are to bunch up.I got mine on Gibraltar because we were being just stomped, and they had all six riding the payload.  I've gotten all of them, so if there's any particular one someone wants pointers for, I can do my best to help.Also, if you're good at Genji - if you properly deflect Soldier's rockets, and then get two kills with the deflected rockets - you'll get both Soldier's two-kills-one-rocket-use achievement AND Genji's two-kills-one-deflect-use.","

The fact that Mercy is now 'unplayable' or 'Dead' is incorrect. Her ultimate has been reduced to 15 seconds which (Unless countered by other ults) Grants her practical invincibility while healing and damaging foes. Rez is such a over-powered ability and I do not see how making it slower is so terrible and causes everyone to cry out. If your a Mercy one-trick, you should have learnt to flex onto new patches to this hero.

After taking so long people assumed that they must be making some huge changes with both iterations of valk. They weren’t. They just took ages to do extremely basic nerfs to her current boring kit. So while everyone else doesn’t have to deal with original valk Mercy anymore, the Mercy players are pissed because they didn’t address any of their concerns about how BORING she had become to play and also because the massive feedback threads that everyone put forward 100’s of abilities, changes,etcetcetc wasn’t even looked at.

/sarcasm onYeah she is totally fine. Due to last weeks Overbuff stats she is the 4th best healer by winrate with 49.something leaving Ana in the dust easily.So you can play her ifa) you want to challenge yourself with a lower winchance.b) you like holding down left mouse button while shifting to different teammates. Sometimes you can mix the experience up with pressing e which not only overpoweredly rezzes a friend but also gives you the convenient opportunity to take a sip of your coffee or take a bite out of your sandwich. To make the experience complete you can sometimes press q so you don't have to worry about pesky enemies shooting at you. This also improves your left mouse button holding experience for you don't have to release the button to switch beam targets.What a fine hero to play. It really challenges you to master your button holding technique so you can have a great impact on the game.Blizzard did a fine job on finetuning the hero for players who instead of learning mechanical skill focus on their future sight abilities./sarcasm off,"

Rez is such a over-powered ability and I do not see how making it slower is so terrible and causes everyone to cry out.i've been seeing much Mercy gameplay lately and while she's practically invincible her 60 hps did not changed, most of the enemies now will just casually ignoring her, holding their ground and keep shooting, just like when she's not ulting.i'm tired to explain the rez, let's just say it's now so situational and having so much drawbacks it's just better off to not have it.she's not unplayable though, as most of you guys kept reminding me, it's good to know some people still going to play her while i'm learning other heroes.","

"02/12/2018 03:01 AMPosted by DELTaENRez is such a over-powered ability and I do not see how making it slower is so terrible and causes everyone to cry out.I still play Mercy and make her work, but I want to address this.With Mass Resurrect, I averaged around 11 resurrects per match. When OG Valkyrie was pushed to live, I doubled that average (not a good thing). With double instant resurrect Valkyrie, I was back to my normal average.With the current version of resurrect, I get about 7 to 9 per match. Far less, if the team still treats Mercy like she wasn't nerfed and die somewhere out in Timbuktu. Being locked in the animation for almost two seconds while out of position is suicide. If you don't die and you're solo healing, which is the norm, nearly two seconds of not healing will likely get another teammate killed.Usually, this would be something I'm fine with. The problem I have with Mercy has less to do with how fun she is, and more to do with how flat her skill curve has become. This started with Valk 1.0. With the original rework you could fly in, res, fly out, when someone died. No need to think about it, just do. A Bronze Mercy player could do it because they could get away with it, a t500 Mercy could do better because they knew how to get away with it and who to prioritize, but the observable results were the same.What set a more skilled Mercy apart from the others was how many times they got Valkyrie, and how many times they resurrected while it was up. It was an exponential increase because Valkyrie was insanely powerful, but the overpowered nature of her kit scaled with the player's game knowledge.Following that three ring circus, each nerf has exacerbated the issue, and now it's at its worst.  That's probably why Mercy players at the top kept suggesting that resurrect should be earnable, but apparently that's too complicated for the Mercy players at lower skill levels? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","

It really challenges you to master your button holding technique so you can have a great impact on the game.Blizzard did a fine job on finetuning the hero for players who instead of learning mechanical skill focus on their future sight abilities.Mercy has always been bottom of the barrel for skill requirements, low skill floor and low skill ceiling kind of character with a horribly lacking/basic kit overall.Blizzard could actually do something and give her a creative E, they could even give her the 1.0 ressurection but actually make it so it has restrictions and counter-play.E.g, LoS is required to Res, and/or Mercy no longer has invulnerability, or Mercy actually has a 1-2 second cast time on her ultimate so she can't just spring out of nowhere and massively change the fight, aka 1.0 res with her invul buff along side to really put the nail in the coffin.","

"1st off no mercy main back in 1.0 wanted a rework...the entire 2.0 problems are the ppl who complained and asked for it.2ndly...Valk is a horrible ultimate.On ptr, with the gun buffs, it turned her into a dps threat...nor what a primary healer needed and was rightfully removed.However after that it was basically flying and aoe heal/dmg buff.Tbh it's not fit for her. Mercy is picked for her single target healing. If a team needed group they'd pick someone else..Flying was just another issue...did devs not see how many ppl hated pharah cause of her hard to hit self? So why give her an even better version of it?Rez being on E was bad design.However because of all nerfs to it, while still powerful, is a double edged sword. It rdenies her movement which is according to the devs part of their mobile healer.. And then we come to the god awful valk-rez combo issue...NO other ultimate shafts the hero for using another skill.Valk punishes player for using their rez. It makes you basically stand still asking to be killed while also wasting your ult time you could be healing.On top of the issues above...they gutted ALL fun from her.Sym and torb are more fun than mercy and when that is the case you KNOW something isn't right.","

"So I really enjoy the updated version.  I will agree that Lucio is a must pick because he can wall ride across the map including the outer walls where no one can get there except a Pharah.  Not allowing him to wall ride or make his wall ride move at walking speed might fix that.My main input would be that I think in order to capture the enemy flag, your teams flag must be at it's home spot.  This worked great back in the Quake 3 Threewave (CTF) days.  If teams have both flags then it forces each team to try and get your flag back so you can score.","

"Crosspost from reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7x4jei/the_actual_guide_to_competitive_ctf_how_the_gms/######################################################I think CTF is a fantastic game mode, but there are a lot of people who don't know what they are doing. Not only have I seen it in game, but I've seen posted ""advice"" that will frankly make you lose games. So I'd like to set the record straight, as someone who is currently 4200 SR (and rising) in the game mode.First off, do you know how to play? Pretend a teammate picks Sym/Torb/Bastion and says they will defend your flag. What is your opinion of this?The correct opinion is that this is a terrible decision, and potentially game throwing. (Note: don't be mean to them over it though, but we'll get into that). The biggest mistake people make with regards to CTF is trying to play it like some entirely new game, where you have defenders, flag flankers, and other new roles. It's still Overwatch. Pushing as a team and winning the team fight is the most important thing. Once you've done that, taking any objective (a flag, a payload, a capture point) is easy. So let's get into some details...######################################################### The basic game flowLet's walk through a game and different scenarios to explain the current theory/meta of CTFThe ideal play - your team pushes out as 6, all together. You fight the enemy team in the middle of the map (as close to their flag as possible), and win the team fight. Your team pushes in together on the flag while the enemy is dead, and get a free flag cap. Repeat until you win.They have a defender - congratulations, they've given you an easy win. Now you can fight 6v5 outside of their flag area. Once you win this team fight with your player advantage, you can crush any lone defender with superior numbers, and take the free flag.They send a flanking Lucio to your flag - more tricky, but still a bad call on their part. Of course if you can catch and kill the Lucio on his way over, do it, but otherwise commit to your strategy. Push in, fight the enemy team who are down a player (or two if they also have a defender), and take their flag. Now, let your flag returner cap alone (no enemy can contest them) while every other player goes and kills the enemy Lucio. You *should* be able to stop the Lucio around mid-map, assuming you committed to the fast push at the start.Note: People get scared about these back-cappers, but they are visible through walls and can't use their movement abilities. It is not difficult to stop them if you have a player advantage, which you *will* if you pushed and fought while the enemy was down a player.You lose the first fight - This will happen, particularly if the enemy team is staying together as well. Try to get out with at least 3, ideally 4 players. This means if you lose 2, back up! If you can keep some people alive, you might be able to stall for respawns by your flag. If you clean wipe, that's a free cap for the enemy.Note: Generally, whenever you are down players, the safe/smart thing to do is regroup on your flag. Once you have your full team, then you push out again.######################################################### Irregular casesThere are times when it's best to split up, or times when you must anyway (do to uncooperative teammates).If you win a team fight near your own flag, send your capper out early. Before you even finish the fight. Let's say you were defending as 6 after dying and regrouping, and you get three kills. Tell that Lucio to **go go go**. Your team can clean up the left over enemies, but if you wait they will be respawning on their flag. If your Lucio leaves early, they should be able to beat respawns, even from the other side of the map.If you have a defender: try to nicely explain that pushing together is better, and ask them to try. Don't get toxic though, that won't help. I've watched my GF deal with this at gold CTF rank. She has gotten a good percentage of her teams to group and push (and then get wins), so even in the ""low ranks"" it's not hopeless. If they insist, try to continue the strategy with 5. It's still possible to win, especially if the enemy team isn't together as 6 as well (like if they have either a defender or a flanking back-capper).The full cheese hold - The enemy sits as 6 on their flag, waiting for you to push. Hoping to kill you with a defender advantage, and then rapidly go steal your flag. All I have to say is take it slow, and try to avoid giving them multiple kills. Don't rush in (for once), but poke until you find a good opening. As long as you keep most of your team alive, they shouldn't be able to push out and cap from it. If nothing else, overtime will break their strategy entirely (with the forward flag spawns).Finally, there are going to be times where team fights are chaotic even trades. Times where each side has 2 or 3 people alive, both flags have been taken, and you must make rapid decisions. The cool thing about CTF is, for the first time, there are two objectives, not one, to consider. How you allocate your teams resources (the players) to each can be tricky, but that's the fun!My general recommendation is to avoid losing on both fronts. Sending one or two people might not be enough to stop a flag carrier in time, and it could also lose you the fight with the enemy's team. It will be better to just win your fight and take the flag, netting you an even trade of captures, than splitting too much and losing both. Basically, always try to fight with an advantage. Which most often means staying grouped.######################################################So I've covered the core approach, and a handful of irregular scenarios. If you have questions, feel free to post and I'll respond.Personally, I believe this ""meta approach"" of CTF, like all metas in the game, will spread down the ranks as more and more people learn the game mode. Not only does it help you win, but it eliminates many of the ""cancer"" aspects of the mode I see people complaining about. Play CTF like it's still Overwatch, not a wacky arcade game. Group with your team, win more, and have more fun. Good luck!","

"First of all, Yeah i get that mccree isnt in the best of spots right now, His flashbang is good to counter flankers but it doesnt always work..i personally find the flashbang rather frustrating to play against, its meant to counter mobility but 90% of the times its used to finish off or quickly wipe out of the map a person without it, Like Torb, or Bastion, Or to make a rein drop his shield, or kill orisa etc We are also missing a good Anti Dive counter, And specifically a tracer counter, This wouldnt change much, it would still mean mccree counters Genji/Tracer and is still a very powerful at melee ranges, i just tried to make flashbang not be as ""You cant do anything once its out, Your dead"" And give it a small counterplay other than just stay away from mccree and guess if he has flashbang or notSo, you could think this of as a mccree rework to make him anti diveFlashbang-Increased Area of effect by 50% (might be lower or higher!)-Flashbang No longer is a stun-any person under the area of effect of the flashbang will be:Blinded for 2 secondsHave their movement abilities disabled for 2 secondsSlowed down by 25%-Cooldown stays the sameRoll-Reduced cooldown from 8 seconds to 5 secondsDeadeye-When mccree Activates his ult the cooldown on his Roll gets reset-Mccree can roll while he has deadeye active","

"As everyone is sharing their ideas on how to balance the least played characters (sym, torb, hanzo, shadow, etc) I will join this stream, here are my ideas.Torbjorn:turret (shift):- You can create a turret that attacks the nearest enemy automatically, shoots once per second, has 100 points of life.- After inflicting 4000 added damage between the turret and torbjorn, you now build a level 2 turret that shoots 2 times per second and has 150 life points- If the damage inflicted exceeds 8000 points you now build a level 3 turret, which fires 2 missiles every second and has 200 life points. missiles inflict area damage. (very good against shields).- You can repair the turret of any level with your hammer.- When being destroyed the turret of any level loose 2 armor packs.With these changes to the turret allow Torbjorn focus more on the defense and to generate damage to the enemy, allowing more constant damage and can survive longer as the turret loose armor.Hammer (2):- You can throw your hammer 4 meters, if it hits a heroes it paralyzes it for 0.5 seconds.This gives Torbjorn more chance to survive a melee attack.Tracking mine (new skill):- Torbjorn uses 50 armor to create a mine that attaches to the first nearby enemy he detects and slows it by 20% for 2 seconds. You can have a maximum of 2 mines at a time.Not being able to control the level of your turret may cause less damage to level 1 of the turret, so this will help you control more space and your turret may cause a little more damage.SymmetraOverload of shields (Q):- Symmetra overloads the shields of an ally for 4 seconds, converting all of their life points into shield, up to a maximum of 400 shield.- During these 4 seconds, the affected ally can not die even if his shield points reach 0.- After these 4 seconds if the affected ally's shield points are equal to 0, the ally will die instantly.- After these 4 seconds if the affected ally still has shield points, those shield points become life points.Sentinel turret (shift):- Symmetra can place a sentinel turret that will attack the first enemy that enters its range and will give 20 shield to the first ally that enters its range.- The turrets can not attack an enemy and grant shields to an ally at the same time.- The turrets give priority to shield the allies.- The turrets can be destroyed with 2 attacks.- The shield granted to the ally and the damage done to the enemies is added by each turret that affects the target.Mobile shield (E):- The projected shield moves 20% slower.this will help Symmetra control more space.At the moment this is the only thing that has occurred to me, and I would like to play these characters in competitive, I even have the golden weapon of symmetra.Sorry for the bad english.","

"I'm sure we all know why they took it away, and in that instance if a player has been ""avoided"" by nearly everyone that they can be matched with, then it should still allow them to be paired. To make it clear, let's say that you have an even chance of getting paired with someone in your elo. You avoid that player, and the chances of getting paired with them become extremely low. However if everyone in that elo avoids this player, than it becomes random which team will get the player (hence why it's not a 0% chance). It's not foolproof, but this way the chances of you specifically being paired with someone you would rather not ever play with again goes down drastically. And it wouldn't ruin it for those players that may have been avoided unfairly (like when my entire team got reported by a guy last night because we lost). I realize at Masters and GM this wouldn't be as effective but hey, I guess that's what comes with being better than everyone else","

It's human nature and it would happen again.The only viable solution here is to implement the suggested 'Wild' and 'Strict' queuing system for competitive.'Wild' is basically the queue as we currently have it.'Strict' brings into effect a role selector whether that be a blanket class option (tank, support, DPS or defense), or 3 preferences for characters within a certain class. This is kept in strict 2-2-2 setting.Naturally, both queues will face off against each other or themselves depending on the MMR averages. This should make people happy who don't care and just want to game.The reporting settings for Wild can then be lessened, allowing for one-tricks or off-meta. The report settings for Strict would be just that, one-tricks, non-communication and trolls would be banned even more quickly than the current system, from the Strict queue exclusively. Allowing them to continue playing, in Wild.So essentially Wild would become a haven for these people, and the people who want to work together as a team would go strict.To me, it's logical, and the only way to make competitive work moving forward.","

"The only reason the feature was taken down was because it was being outright abused.Players aren't going to use it for purposes of finding better, more well matched games. Players are going to use it on the guy who picked Doomfist in QP to get better at him, even though he's doing terribly. Or on the Symmetra main who chose her for attack, or on that Widowmaker who is really really good.If people weren't so salty, the system would work great. But people would sooner just avoid a player who is better than them than accept that they were outplayed. As much as it would help certain situations, it would be absolutely abused.

"I just want to correct a misconnception that has already been repeated in this thread.What we had before, was Avoid Player, and it actually said 'do not put this player in my game' at a programatic level.One of the top Widows in the world, quickly was put on many 'Avoid Player' lists, and this prevented them from getting in a game, I believe Jeff said they had a 20 min Queue.This is NOT what I am asking for.I am asking for 'Avoid Player as Teammate'. Essentially I do not want to queue up, encounter someone I do not want to play with again, and then have to try and queue dodge, quit for the night, or risk it and just queue again.Put them on the OTHER team, just not my team.Now the 2nd issue is one of 'well then I would just avoid all the bad players'.Fair enough.Let us only put 3 people on our 'Avoid' List, and have them fall off that list every 3 days.Then you have to be PRETTY SURE on who you want to not play with, and that prevents in part, someone from saying 'hah idSurge is a noob, and so are these other 5 players, I'll avoid them all and only team with the pro's!!'.Now, Blizz is a lot smarter than me. Their match maker I am sure is all kinds of complex, and I'm pretty sure they can put in an 'Avoid Player as Teammate' that accounts for this.The alternative, is this community continues to tear at eachothers throats, and for no reason other than Blizzard perpetuating this toxic environment.","

"Avoid Player (as Teammate) is what it was when first released, and it was removed because it broke match making via abuse of it.People ended up Avoiding everyone on a losing team, just so they would increase their chances of getting with the team that won. It's human nature and it would happen again.I'm pretty sure it was the exact opposite of this. People would avoid players who were extremely good. Jeff even highlighted a great widowmaker player who couldn't find matches because people thought he was too dominant. We are constantly improving the matchmaker. We learn more each day. We have one of our best engineers and best designers full time dedicated to the system. Many of those “silent” patches that go out during the week are adjustments to the system. For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy – they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match.So we want the opposite, we're not asking to avoid the player altogether, we just don't want them on our team. They can still play matches and as I said before if you're the type of player where 50%> of the queue doesn't want to play with you that says something about your play and willingness to be a team player. In general you shouldn't be repeatedly matched up with the same player on your team but for the times that you absolutely do not want to play with someone the option should be there, even if it's in limited amounts of avoids or the timeframe that it lasts. I can already ""dodge"" playing with someone by waiting before a queue if I just played with them. Why make it more random than that?","
						Feb 3
					",,,,,,,
"I'd be fine with avoid player up until a certain rank. Up top where it already can take 30 mins to find a match, I think you should be limited with the number of people you can avoid. People can avoid toxic people and one tricks all they want, but people would also avoid anyone who is better than them in terms of skill and that could lead to unfair situations for the higher-tier players.","

"I understand the logic behind the idea, or at least, underdtsnd where one can come to this as a favorable solution.

Here is the thing, you have tools at your disposal now to acoid this problem: Make lots of friends as you play. Group with those friends who are on during your regular play sessions.

"So, for the past six matches, I've had a guy showing up who immediately starts insulting me.  If I'm on his team, he straight up throws (I'm talking gun-only Torb going in 1v6 throwing) and if I'm on the enemy team he tries to win.  He tells my teammates to report me, making up lies about what I did ""last match"" to make it sound like I'm a toxic player, even though I'm just sitting here quietly trying to play the game, and I'm pretty sure I was doing okay and none of my other teammates mentioned seeing anything wrong with my gameplay.Every single match I report him for everything he's done--abusive chat, griefing, harassment.  But I keep getting him.  Again and again.  This is happening at one in the afternoon in plat, so it's not like there' s a shortage of different players to match me with.  I assume I keep getting him because he's preferred me, but... why is this even a thing?  Why does somebody else get to decide, all on their own, that they're going to be in more or my matches? If only there was some sort of feature I could use to... avoid players... that I don't want following me around through multiple matches.  That would be cool.  Sure, avoid gave some higher-elo players long wait times, which could easily have been fixed with minor tweaks, but Blizzard was perfectly willing to do away with the feature entirely to protect those GM widowmakers from having to wait twenty minutes... but a feature that allows trolls to single out another player and actively grief them over the course of two hours, whilst providing only minor benefits for everyone else? Better leave that with no adjustments.inb4: ""Just queue dodge him.""  Sure fine, but if the only option Blizzard gives us to avoid toxic players is to stop playing their game for a while, they probably need to look at better options.","

You'l probably sit somewhere in mid-high master.Remember good aim can also direcrly correlate to your in game positioning. For example. If a player who has amazing aim and good positioning want to utilize a certain part of the map to secure a kill, then he can confidently take that risk and reap the rewards.However if the said player gets to that risky spot and misses 70% of their shots, its not exactly going to do much.

McCree and Soldier have a limited time frame at that rank to do the their job, because its only a matter of seconds until the other team's D.va and Winston are suffocating you out of whatever space you were in. I find it very difficult to play soldier, because I feel like I spend more time just running away from D.va than I do shooting.Tracer is a little bit different, because she can't be overwhelmed the same way the ranged characters can.

"Ok this post is gonna be very contraversal, but, I don't think Mercy should have been nerfed past the last change, now my reason for this is that Blizzard needs to stop nerfing hero's in favour of bringing the other heros up to meet their level.

Now let me just run something by you LucioLucio amp it up abilitys cooldown has been reduced to 8 secondsDrop the beat has had its ultimate charge increased by 10%Drop the beats shields decay 20% slowerThis here increases Lucio's utility as a support, he can speed boost and increase his healing more frequently allowing for a more flexible playstyleZenyattaZenyatta's Orb of Dischord now lasts 4 seconds when lost line of sightZenyatta's healing orb now increases healing received by that hero by 30% aswell as maintaining the current healing potentialZenyatta now has the ability to charge his orb of discord becoming more visable aswell as slowing down his mobility and allowing himself to take 30% more damage but when it is charged allows 50% more damage dealt to that hero for 4 seconds after charged.These changes would make Zenyatta a more risk vs reward character, he would improve the healing to specific targets and help deal damage, but would risk the damage dealt to himself AnaAna's Nano boost now gives affected player 30% movement speedAna's sleep now leaves a lingering speed debuff (30%) for 4 seconds after target wakes upAna's main projectile speed is increased by 30%These changes to Ana allow her to make big plays with her nano aswell as providing support with her sleep, especially against something like a Gengi Blade or a Tac VisorMercyMercy now has instant rez during her ultimateMercy gains a rez charge during her ultimateDuring Rez Mercy is able to shoot her weapon and gain an extra 20% ult while she is performing a rezThis may seem insane, however these changes will mimic how powerful the other supports are, allowing Mercy to still have an insane spot in the metaConclusionThis is just what I think, it is pure opinion and I would like to know why this would or wouldn't work, it is my first post on the forums and I would like everyone to know, I understand that this seems crazy, but there are only ideas.Thank you for your time!","

At this point I dont want him changing even with the probably few hours I have a week on the game now and most of the time I play with Bots because I just dont want to let my team down with garbage healing (if im even in range) or a luke warm speed boost.Sadly, we probably wont see any improvements to his healing because of an additional healer to the roster, would only make the ever so increasing return of the Tank Meta that much better.

"Voice comms are great, and clearly the only option for competitive 6-stacking scrims... but for regular games there's plenty of reasons why one might not want (or be able) to use voice comms.That said, here's a list of additional comms I think are the most desperately needed on the comms wheel:Point button: ""point"", i.e. go to point don't C9, focus enemies on point etc.Focus target [hero] button, said as: ""[hero]"". If reticle over a shield/bubble, ""focus shield/bubble"".[Hero] [ability] button. On enemies: ""[hero] no [ability]"". On yourself (no reticle on enemy), hold an ability on c/d while pressing comm button: ""[time] to [ability]"". On Zen, pressing this comm while using orb of discord results in ""[hero] discord"".[Hero] 1 HP (very low) button: ""[hero] 1"".[Hero] half HP (damaged) button: ""[hero] half"".One class of comms that would be difficult to incorporate into the wheel would be hero position comms. I.e. ""monkey top right"" is not the hardest, but what if the team is scattered and top right means different things to different people? ""monkey spaceship"" isn't exactly something that'd go easily into a wheel. You could program the game client so that different map positions were tagged and ordered into the comm wheel based on physical proximity to the player... but ultimately I think it'd just be a bit too slow for practice use.AddendumI just watched a random stream game with mostly pros and noted some of the comms they made, as a cross-check:genji discordgenji no dash pointgenji lowtracer 1monkey has ultthey trancedmonkey right topmonkey halfbehind tracer help medva discordmonkey lowgenji 1fight pointwhere tracer? pointbreak shieldbaby dva 1genjizentracer no re(call)pointmonkey discordmccree right topthey tranq?monkey no bubble","

But if you want to make it really cute and spend with ink the $30-$50 range instead of getting a normal teddy bear and chocolates you could get her that Winston plush and a valentines thing of butter fingers that has a note attached to it which say ""did somebody say peanut butter?"" In my opinion the second one is way cooler and cute but it all comes down to how long you've been dating and how much you wanna spend.

"I mean I RNG does attempt to mimic real world variations in shots due to physical conditions. Except as a game we already throw out certain aspects out the window such as hitscan and no physical effect due to gravity (except say junkrat). This aspect of RNG spread is not something I see really adding any value. For a character such as S76 or Widowmaker Assault rifle or Tracer or Sombra you actually need RNG because for single shot weapons this is the only way to lower accuracy. However, for characters like you mentioned I am not sure why it can't be a fixed hitbox that is always consistent.It would make Roadhog's hook feel much better as his shot could then be skillfully placed rather than say sometimes you might kill something depending upon how RNG works out for you.","

A hell of a lot of people see Widow on their team and just stop trying or decide its time to pick a hero they never played before to “practice” on. I’ve barely played her last couple of weeks because I just got so sick of that kind of behaviour.Reality is that if the group is nice and just gets on with it she’ll do a job same as any other DPS at that level. Her win rates are comparable to McCree and Tracer there and no one has anything bad to say about them.,"

"Ana is not the best for FFA. Don't feel worse because you cant kill people in it.Basically, when you're not scoped in, Ana shoots very fast projectiles and those are the main ways you should heal someone close to you. Further away targets or a jumping genji/tracer can be scoped in and hitscanned to hit them easier as your scoped shots are hitscan.To practice sleep darts, use mei as her secondary fire is very alike Ana's dart.Use your nade more offensively more often! Seriously, biotic grenade is one of the most powerful abilities. Enemies that are purple are so hugely vulnerable. If you need to heal yourself, try healing some other teammates as well but it's to just solely use it on yourself. Try and nade tanks as purple tanks are absolutely boned most of the time. Also, against a deflecting Genji, hit the floor and heal yourself while denying him healing at the same time.Nanoboost charges very fast. Don't be afraid to use it or hold it all game. A nano' Mccree or Soldier even without ults are very effective due to the range they can fire at.

"Righto is this an original idea?-We make ability take two steps instead of one- Increase the precision and controlActivating the ability brings up an arrow that does normal damage to the target and will apply a tracker on the target hit. Second arrow is readied and will home in on the player after exactly one bounce.With this you can target any surface that has an angle of your target and secure a follow up shot on the target from behind cover.Think Hanamura first choke point, you tag someone with a body shot, they seek cover on the side towards point B.

"One game, I blocked two of Reinhardt's Earthshatter's as Orisa. The first time, he used Earthshatter and I used fortify just before it landed. 3 of my teammates were stunned, but I stood my ground and melted Reinhardt before he could do any serious damage, and stopped the rest of his team from taking advantage of my prone allies.In the same game, in almost the same spot, Reinhardt used Earthshatter and I threw up my shield, saving my team behind it. He charged, and I used fortify before melting him down just enough for a ""fist bump."" Sadly, no one noticed my efforts other than the Reinhardt.","

"Tracer/Genji- They are really good at solo carry if you can work with their kit. They have high mobility and damage. It's especially good to have a Zarya with Tracer (Grav + Pulse) or a Sombra with Genji (EMP Blade).Widowmaker- The ability to One shot kill has great opportunity to solo carry, that is if you can hit shots. Don't stay in the same place for a long time cause your tracers will give your position off. If you can't hit headshots, remember that 120 damage is better than nothing.Sombra- As good as Widow when it somes to solo carry. You can heal, damage, and disrupt the enemy. Just do the Translocator near a hacked health pack, go invisible behind enemy lines, pick and/or damage, and translocate back. Also plan your EMP with another strong ult like Tactical Visor or Dragon Blade.","

No communication, no chat, refuses to say anything except of insta locking their main DPS's. I just don't get it. When I 3 stack, I always bring at least one fixed healer, one flex, and myself (supp/tank). I can't for the love of god understand how people can go into a game 3 stack and just instalock 3 DPS as if betting their whole life savings the rest of the three wouldn't do the same. Those three picks don't even have any synergy. Luckily, all 3 randos including me were willing to fill in and clenched our butts to victory (see that silver thing as Orisa, 3 DPS mind you. The supps were incredibly cooperative too). That could've gone real bad if the randos weren't willing to compromise (and the opponents weren't running a proper comp either).So again, why?","

"I have absolutely NO problem with low skill floor heroes. Quite the contrary/ I think they’re essential for opening up an avenue of the game to players who would otherwise struggle to perform at all in a game of this type. My ONLY concern would be low skill floor heroes, with low skill ceilings, reliably being counters to high skill floor heroes with high skill ceilings. It feels like too much of an “easy” button and I raise an eyebrow st someone defeating another who arguably has a higher degree of skill, almost entirely because of their hero choice with minimal investment on their part to do so Thankfully this is a very VERY rare thing in overwatch Nearly ALL of the low skill floor heroes, have HIGH skill ceilings- even if they emphasize something other than pure mechanical aiming, but instead emphasize observation and game sense appropriate for their role. I’m 100% cool with these guys going toe to toe with, well. Everyone. And I really hope/wish ALL heroes can eventually have nearly even skill ceilings to help ensure a rather solid sense of balance.As long as the skill you put in is equal to the skill another puts in, even if the first step was a bit different- that’s pretty solid in my books. And if you’re dishing out more? You should win. Less, you should lose. In an ideal world anyways.","

"Doomfist, ‎Akande Ogundimu‎, The Successor, Punchman, Mr. Fister, whatever you want to call him he's supposed to be a hero who is all about punching. He had two interesting moves that were scrapped during development because they apparently took away from him being the ""punch guy"". Yet for whatever reason his primary fire is an anemic shotgun that reloads slowly over time. Why?Meanwhile his Rocket Punch, what should be the main focus of his kit, is his secondary fire. What's worse is that in it's current state it is best used as a mobility tool, because it's too unreliable as an attack. I'll repeat that, the punching hero's main punching attack is best used to run towards a battle or to run away from your enemies, not actually punching them.I don't know about you but when I play as a hero named DoomFIST I want to punch people. That's why I think Doomfist's Rocket Punch should be reworked into being his primary fire. Here are my ideas for such a rework:Rocket Punch's damage would stay roughly the same, it's hitbox would be increased by a bit (nowhere near it's old size though), and the delay before being able to punch again would be 1.5 seconds. To compensate for all that it's charge time would be doubled and the distance it travels would be reduced by nearly 50%.An uncharged punch would do 50 damage, knock an enemy back with no chance for wall damage (or the additional stun that comes with it), and would travel 0 meters. For each half second you charged the attack it would gain 20 punch damage, 30 wall damage, and 3 meters. Also the amount of temporary shields you gain would increase with charge time as well.Charge time 0 seconds = 50 damage, no wall damage, 0 meters. 0 shields.Charge time 0.5 seconds = 70 damage, 30 wall damage, 3 meters. 10 shields.Charge time 1 second = 90 damage, 60 wall damage, 6 meters. 20 shields.Charge time 1.5 seconds = 110 damage, 90 wall damage, 9 meters. 30 shields.Charge time 2 seconds = 130 damage, 120 wall damage, 12 meters. 40 shields.I think upping his base health to 300 would help him avoid getting gunned down from a distance (with 50 of it being armor), but perhaps being able to generate shields more easily would be good enough.I honestly think this would be a great change to Doomfist because it would make the character better in a number of ways.- Rocket Punch would feel better for the puncher and the punchee. You would actually be able to reliably punch people more often, but if you were fighting Doomfist you would have more time to dodge or defend yourself while he was charging up, not to mention the reduced range means you could avoid it easier.- Doomfist would finally have a reliable method of dealing damage even if you would need to be at close range. Right now there are moments where you can do nothing but quick melee or run for cover, waiting for your ammo to regenerate or one of your moves to be available to use. No other Attack hero is ever this helpless.- Doomfist would be more of a threat up close which fits a martial artist wielding a power gauntlet. Getting up close and punching people to death would be a viable strategy, instead of leaping in and scoring a kill before needing to waste your abilities to run away. He would feel more consistent.What are your thoughts? Should Rocket Punch be made a more reliable move but one that is harder to score one hit kills with? Or should it stay a high risk high reward move that is best used for mobility?","

Last I heard only his hand cannon was adjusted, playing with him currently it's definitely not reliable because you can easily whiff punches you should have hit (Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogcx_kO0xSo) , which is why skilled Doomfist players like Chipsa say it's best used as a mobility tool. At first it was ludicrously easy to hit with, now it's way too hard, I feel like the ideas I listed would make it better for both Doomfist and his opponent.02/09/2018 04:33 PMPosted by GildTesoroWhy does it need to be harder.

						Dec 30, 2016
					",,,,,,,
"The problems with dropping ridiculously low:> You'd pi** off a lot of people by throwing games just to get down to a lower SR. The only way this would be ""sort of"" ok would be if you'd do it with 5 other friends - intentionally losing and dropping down. Still, it'd be unfair to the players in the low ranks because you guys are way too strong for them, even though both team's SR might be the same.> Let's say you drop from 3000 to 800. It'll go fast by the end as losing streaks work just like winning streaks: after the 5th or so loss, you'll loose a lot more SR with each loss. Me for example, I dropped from 2800 to 2100 in one week (not because I wanted to) - and my 10th consecutive loss had me lose like 90 SR. But when you're finally 800, there's the next problem: You will win, win, win. Which is nice as you get the CP you want. BUT: After the 10th or so win, your winning streak will take off and you'll be nearing your old SR in no time. There's the next issue - damn, you might have to lose just to end winning streaks. But remember that KOTH matches can last up to 5 rounds, sometimes with long overtimes, possibly more than 30 minutes for a single match. My advice: Play the best you can. A big chunk of getting a golden gun is done by receiving end of season rewards:Bronze	1-1499	100 CPSilver	1500-1999	200 CPGold	2000-2499	400 CPPlatinum	2500-2999	800 CPDiamond	3000-3499	1200 CPMaster	3500-3999	2000 CPGrandmaster	4000-5000	3000 CPPlay as good as you can, earn CP on the way up and if you break through any of the SR limits for a new rank, e.g. diamond, you'll get a big fat reward at the end of the season.","
						Dec 30, 2016

Depends. You get points for winning and you get a bonus end of season for your season high. So you could try to make yourself start in bronze or silver and hopefully carry 300 out of 400 or so games and win or you could place at master and get rewarded 2000 cp end of season meaning you only need to win 100 games or just get to GM and stop playing for the season.,"

"Hanzo isn’t garbage. His ult is great for clearing points and payloads, but requires skill outside scatter arrow. I love playing McCree also, but more often than not anymore can’t because teams lack vital roles and heroes. If your team lacks tanks, you won’t have space to play McCree, and using cover won’t be enough to secure picks because no one is drawing fire and with four or five other DD’s as teammates, you’ll probably just get killed or flanked again and again. Team composition really matters.","

"I'm a support main. My hit scan targeting skill is unremarkable. If I want to DPS my main choices are Reaper, Phara, and occasionally, (when I'm feeling dirty) Junk Rat.Reaper is not a stand-up DPS. If you pull the trigger on someone facing toward you then you are doing it wrong. You need to use side passages and his teleport to get completely behind the other team then eviscerate their healer, snipers, or tank by putting you gun against the back of their head before you fire a single shot. There is a reason he has an unlock for killing 3 people with a single clip (8 shots). It's a little nerve wracking but very rewarding. Reaper has an undocumented tool to help with this - despite his damage output, he makes almost no sound at all when he walks. If you come from outside their line of sight they get zero audio warning. His invulnerability is a huge boon for giving you time to learn what the character can do and if you play supports you already have some idea what you need to do to make yourself an appealing target for your side's heals. Finally, his ultimate take tactics, not aim.Phara has a margin of slop in her attacks and the ability to force enemies to do the one thing most people CAN'T. Namely, LOOK UP. If there's an alert McCree or a D.Va that knows their business she's hard countered and you need to swap out ASAP (don't worry, you'll be dead soon enough). But left un-countered she can absolutely wreck face on offense or defense. Another character that can be very forgiving as you climb the learning curve.And Junk Rat. Sigh. No-skill clown-bait but the recent mine nerf will go a long way towards weeding out the posers form the dedicated demolitionists. You can fortify your position or trap essential entryways. You have one of the best point-blank attacks in the game even with the nerf, and if you have a flair for geometry, you can rain down hell without exposing yourself in any way.","

"Moira is not as bigger threat as people make her out to be. She can't clear turrents anymore and against high health and mobility opponents her orb is just ult charge for supports. It's meant to be a versatile team fight finisher in my opinion or turn a room into a death trap, along with being an assist for her beam (and let's be honest beam plus orb is WAY better than just beam).Moira on cooldown is also super easy to kill when you have the mobility or damage. She is also absolutely useless against Bastion at the moment, so he is her hardest counter right now (seriously, she does like 0 damage on him right now. It's a joke.)She doesn't need anything. Moira is meant to be a burst healer and a fight finisher. She should have tons of picks and average heals. Her beam ends lives. She isn't really meant to be a hard dps like soldier or a defender like sym or a healer like mercy. She is the games second best life ender after Winston in team fights and that's how she should stay.No change needed.Edit:Also, as we now know from Mercy, whining about supports generally leads to nasty consequences. Now, we have one less decent healer in the game and a hamstrung rez. As people are saying, enough with the nerfing our supports. The support community can't really handle another nerf right now. We are worn out from how terrible Mercy is at the moment. Hence, stop whining and Get Gud, bro. No more complaints about the baddest btch in the game.

I'm tired of liking a character only for the devs to change what I liked about them in the first place. To be fair, it's not just Blizzard, a lot of games have trouble balancing healers.

"Nerfed role?Supports are the keystone to the entire thing. EVERY META has been based off of the best supports, and what synergizes with them. DPS is a straight fill category. The only time you could argue a meta has been based around a DPS is Ironclad Bastion or w/e that was... Maybe like early day World-Destroying FTH McSnipe or early Widow? Point is, it's RARE for a DPS to really set a meta.Supports, followed by tanks, set the meta. Arguably, Tanks, and then Supports, then DPS, dictate if a team succeeds or not. Evidence? OWL Season 1. You can have proven GOD TIER DPS players, and still get dumpstered. You can basically rank all the OWL teams by 1) Their tanks. 2) Their supports. And then 3) Their DPS.So yeah, looking back on things, it does seem like supports face the nerf hammer a little harder than DPS. This also has to do with just the number of supports vs number of dps, etc, etc. Tanks, are arguably, in a good spot rn. Some could use some love, but hopefully things will shake up and we'll see more Rein and Zarya in a map dependent sort of way.There's a decent diversity of comps being played on the ladder at the moment. That's a good thing. Supports are starting to tighten up, being circumstantially viable in a sense. There's no ""always the best, all the time, every map, regardless of comp"" like Mercy was before latest patch. And Mercy is still a good pick with a lot of ladder comps, etc, etc.I see this class war sort of thing going on a lot and I have to ask, what is it you're hoping for from a support hero? Like... Is it strong healing? Is it DPS potential? Is it ability to defend self? Like what? There are options for all tbh... Lot of people love Moira and it's all ""omfg if Moira is nerfed"" but in that sense why didn't Zen appeal to you?  Couldn't land orbs?Iunno. Lot of people seem to be complaining for the sake of complaining and not really understanding the more far reaching implications of their positions.","

Ok this is an odd subject but an actual question. So when I play Overwatch I listen to various types of music. I just feel like I enjoy listening to music with it more than without. So I wanted to know if other people listen to music and if so what kind of music or what artists and songs. And yes I am aware that it can drown out game sound a little bit which means you may miss a key voice line but I've never had this problem occur because I keep the music down low.,"

"So i was thinking, every hero's all abilities charge their ultimate abilities. Why Mercy's rez doesnt? I think that might be the right buff to her since her ultimate doesnt really impact game that much. The way her ult is used rn is either pocket heal or pocket dmg boost to charge teammates' ults. I dont feel like i do much when i use valk rn. At all. Sometimes when i use it i think im throwing, because i achieve almost 0. Lets be honest, teammates never group up for chain heals and dmg boost so all this 15 secs u scream in voice chat GROUP UP and they do that successfully only when theres a few seconds left. Ults are something that is game changing and Mercy's ult rn is the weakest in the game. At least let it charge faster so Mercy players can feel like they are doing something.

"02/11/2018 05:35 AMPosted by Mineos02/11/2018 04:46 AMPosted by LovelyIt has to be one of the easiest to use abilities in the whole game, can destroy entire Ultimate's, ruin life for Reaper's and Mei's who should have the upper hand in a close range 1 on 1 battle with McCree but they just don't, McCree can slam them in Medium range AND Short range where they should have the advantage, it just feels like such an unskillful ability to see in the Death Cam, for example: You as a Mei, sneaking behind a McCree, said McCree turns around, flashes and then fans the hammer, instantly tearing off nearly if not all of your HP, I honestly think McCree is holding back Mei and Reaper in this meta.I am a McCree main in QP and I would gladly accept any rework on McCree's flashbang, since it's unreliable, deflectable and long cooldown. Give me an area slow empairing movement ability and I would enjoy it far better than a 0.7 sec stun that miss 50% of the time.or just a useful alt fire for close range instead of the fth piece of 5h7t","

...don’t pick a fight with a McCree who still has flashbang? ‘Problem’ solved.,"

Flash bang is too opressive and unfun to play against.Symmetra and Mei cannot be but McCree can.,"

"lol mccree isn't the one who keep mei out of the meta, he is berly consider meta himself. his winrate acrros all the ranks is lower then the other dominant dps in the game.yeah this flash is feels BS as f, but its the only thing that make him viable acrros all the ranks..Btw a good mei can counter his flash(and any other cc in the game) with cryo.","

"All the people defending it are McCree mains, of course. Hard CC should not be in an FPS at all. McCree relies too much on stunning people for kills and all the people that play him (in DM especially) are artificially boosted in their elims by this fact. Good thing he had his damage fall off increased or he would be the undisputed god-king of the hitscans. Get good, scrubs. Get those kills without shooting stationary targets in the head from a few feet away and then you can begin to think you have skill. Mei is equally as stupid, but her hard CC is much more avoidable.","

"At times I seem to have a firm 40 ping, which is the base ping I play at, but for the past few months I have had times where my ping will go up and there will be ghosting or I'll be stuck moving in one direction, or I can't even move. Though, my ping goes up in Overwatch, but anything else, such as discord ping or in skype, I don't show any signs of lagging. This does not occur in any other game I play, and I don't know what to do. Any recommendations?","

"Instead of simply downvoting because you disagree, please read what is being said and respond with your own thoughts. I want to have a constructive conversation instead of kneejerk backlash.This is going to be a VERY long post. I spent a lot of time thinking about this and putting it together.Genji's ult--+Is useless if he can't get that first kill.+Is countered by every support ult in the game+Doesn't make him any harder to kill.+Is HARD to use reliably.Genji himself is countered by+Winston.+Moira+Mei.+Torb's Turret.+Zarya.+Moira.+Sombra.+McCree to an extent.+Roadhog+Doomfist.+Symmetra.+Pharah [what is he going to do to her in the air? She can 2 shot him] Genji's deflect+Lasts 2 seconds+Has a cooldown of 7 seconds.+Is his only defensive ability+Does no direct damage+Does indeed have a visual cue. Things I will agree with+If you want deflect to have a stronger visual indicator.+If you want a more accurate reflection of deflect's hitbox for said indicator.+If you think Genji is hard to kill.+If you think Genji's kit is very good.+If you feel like some of Genji's counters could use some minor buffs.Logical fallacies I'm tired of reading""GENJI IS OP!"" - Genji is the most played hero in quickplay. If Genji is so overpowered then why are so many Genji main's trapped in silver, dying constantly, and under-performing as dps? Why is Genji not dominating quickplay like old Mercy was dominating competitive?Genji is not overpowered, but his kit is PERFECT in that it's a flawless rotation of sorts. Dash in --> alt fire --> melee ---> deflect ---> dash out. Though I do feel like some of the other heroes [mei, symmetra, reaper, mccree] have kits that are very underwhelming and should be balanced  like Genji; abilities that build and play off eachother and work in tandem to create combos and increase their impact. ""Genji has no counters""- No. He does. He arguably has the most soft-counters in the entire game simply because anyone he can't deflect and anyone he has to keep his distance from, is going to make his life hard. Genji's counters are all very popular, very ""meta"" heroes as well. At least ONE of them is usually on every team. But because Genji is so popular and his kit is so great, the people that do play him tend to devote a lot of time into him. I have 150+ hours on Genji in all modes. I have destroyed Sombra. I can kill Moira. I know how to handle Winston. I've learned how to play him in all of these situations on all these different maps against different team comps simply because he is my favorite hero and I play him almost exlusively everyday for hours at a time. Not even to practice, just because he's fun and I have fun playing him. Do you devote that much time on any of his counters?I had this game early this season against this pharah on...dorado I wanna say. She carried their entire team. I was soldier. There was a mccree. I think we even had a widowmaker at one point too. No matter what we did, no matter who we swapped to, even when we did kill her, this Pharah was just un-freaking-stoppable. I check her profile-- All she plays is Pharah. Vs me, someone who only plays soldier occasionally because I play a lot of other heroes more. Of course I was going to lose. Unless you have someone that KNOWS how to deal with a hero AND has the mechanical skill on their counters to actually do it, you are always going to have a hard time. Overwatch is not rock paper scissors. It's like pokemon. Plus-- Overwatch is not a 1v1.What is that Genji's team comp?Is he being pocketed?Is he flanking you while you're busy fighting someone else?Is he waiting for you to use your ult, then popping out of nowhere with his?Does he keep baiting one of your abilities?What map are you on?Do you know how long deflect lasts?Do you know how much damage swiftstrike does?Do you know what his cooldowns are?Do you have the killcam turned on so you can see HOW he killed you?All of these things matter a LOT more than just picking Winston and expecting to win every time.""Genji has too much escapability.""Genji's biggest strength is that he can attack from anywhere, yes, but a Genji out in the open by himself-- is a dead genji. If there are main tanks and off-tanks, main healers and off-healers, then Genji is an off-dps. Hear me out now.Soilder. McCree. Reaper. Pharah. Junkrat. These are the heroes that I consider to be strong, reliable DPS. They can consistently pour damage into the enemy team. They can consistently and reliably secure kills, which is their job. Genji. Tracer. Sombra. Doomfist. These are what I consider off-dps, in that while yes they can be effective [doomfist has a lot of problems but that's its own thread], you do not want any of these characters as your main damage dealers. Because they are inconsistent. Because they are unreliable. Because they, by themselves, simply looking at their kits and stats, do not do enough damage and do not do it reliably. These heroes have specialized roles.Tracer is like a misquito. Her job is to zip around and be annoying af. Cause chaos. Make them scream ""FOCUS THE TRACER""-- get the kills she can get, then recall and zip out. Genji is an assassin. Get in, get the kill as quickly as he can, and then get out. Because Genji, in a straight up brawl, will probably die unless his team is there to support him. Sombra is like the ace in the hole. The ""Secret weapon"" of sorts. They only have one healer? Hack all the health packs, deny them that, and put your team at a big advantage. Hack the mercy so she cant rez that. Drop that EMP into the grav so they cant counter or defend. Tell your team who's low and turn invis, stalk them, and get the kill yourself-- then get out.   Doomfist I dont even know lmao. tank buster? w/e. The point is-- if you are a squishy then Genji is designed specifically to 1v1 you in the backline. That is his job. You are his prey. It's not to charge into you head-on spaming shurikens from midway across the map. It's not to dive in and try to 1v6. Genjis who do these things are the Genjis who always die. That is how you know he is not supposed to be played that way.He is like a bully. If you're a squishy, you're a little kid. He comes along, when nobody's around, to steal your lunch money and then run away before you can tattle.  But if there's anyone else around; especially tanks unless he can dash out or wallclimb somewhere safe-- he is dead. ""Why are Genji mains so defensive/toxic?""-- I do notice that a lot of Genji mains do seem to be angrily responding to the ""NERF GENJI"" threads, and I can say why. It's frustrating, to be blunt. I, myself, do not want blizzard to gut this hero like they've been known to do in the past. To Dva. To Roadhog. To Mercy. He is my favorite character. I love him. Playing him just makes me happy. I have all his skins and emotes and highlight intros, and voicelines-- He is the first character I ever learned to play. He got me out of silver. He taught me how to play the game. He made me love overwatch. I'm just really attached to him. When I login and he's the character greeting me on my screen, I just smile and little. I don't want all of this ""NERF GENJI"" mob mentality to do to him what they've done to mercy; who was my second favorite hero that I just got a gold weapon for :/.  I'm somebody that's been disabled with severe depression and anxiety; there've been lots of days where all I've had was my PS4 and the friends I've made on overwatch. Where, if I couldn't just login and play Genji, I'd have been in a really dark place. I can't speak for other Genji mains, but for me its just-- fear, you know? We/I have this attachment to this character that we love and we've loved and played for so long and put so much into-- that is why mercy mains are so upset. I'm not trying to drown out all criticism or suggestions for Genji changes, I just want them to come from a constructive place instead of people angry about their most recent game who just want to kill the hero. So now, I'm going to tell you how to fight him with every hero.Soldier76: +DO NOT USE YOUR HELIX UNTIL AFTER HE DEFLECTS.--- When I'm playing Genji I expect you to burst me with that rocket as soon as I drop down, so I'm going to be ready for it. Shoot him, especially when he's jumping, then mix it in with your primary fire. Chances are you'll land the hit.+When he swiftstrikes-- put your field down. BUT NOT BEFORE.Once he's wasted his dash, you have 7 seconds before he has it again. I've seen soldiers who put their field down as soon as I'm on them and that's how I know I've already won. Because I'm not going to attack you now, I'm just going to keep jumping around spamming shurikens and make you waste it. +Don't be afraid to sprint and get a little distance.--I can't catch you, not unless I waste a dash, and my primary fire is garbage unless you stand still and let me actually land the shots. At a slight distance, anywhere out of melee range, you have the advantage. +Don't use tac visor if I'm in front of you, unless I've already deflected.-- This should go without saying, but if I'm directly in front of you and you wanna ult-- don't. Pop it, focus on someone else or use it when my back is turned and burst me down. Deflect lasts 2 seconds. +Overall, be cautious. Don't be so trigger happy and don't panic. McCree+Please for the love of everything don't flashbang as soon as you see me. I'm going to deflect it in your face and laugh at you, then headshot you. Like soldier, mid-range is your friend. If I drop down DIRECTLY in front of you, chances are I'm trying to BAIT your flashbang and I'm already deflecting. That flashbang is the only thing you have that's a threat to me, unless your aim is good [which, if you're playing mccree, it should be.]+If you want to pop ult, same with soldier, don't do it directly in front of me. Deflect, reflects in a STRAIGHT LINE. So if I'm staring at you straight on; I'm going to kill you with your own ult. Pretend there's an invisible, narrow hallway in front of me. If you're standing in that hallway-- you will get high-noon'd.Even if you do pop ult, just make sure you're not in that hallway. I can deflect it, but I won't hit you with it, and you']ll probably still kill my team. Tracer+I'm waiting for recall. Don't waste it. Dash in, burst me down from behind, I'll probably deflect reflexively, and if I do bring your health down-- THEN recall and finish me off. You're actually very hard for me to hit believe it or not. You can zip around me a lot faster than I can jump around you.+If I see you running at me and only me-- I'm expecting that pulse bomb; ESPECIALLY if we've been dueling all game and I know you're triggered. I'm going to deflect it and laugh at you. Your best bet is doing it in a teamfght when Im preoccupied with someone else-- or just...not using it on me at all.+Honestly, it'd be better for you to just not bother with me. I'm hard to hit. You're hard to kill. You're wasting your blinks and I'm wasting my kit. The kit I NEED to survive any engagement.GenjiWhoever has the best reflexes wins.Reaper+You actually have a bigger advantage against me than you think you do. You heal yourself with every shot. I've only a 2 second deflect. I'm probably going to wait for you to come close, because I know you NEED to to get that sweet headshot, and send it all back in your face.  so don't do that, unless its from behind.You see me up there jumping around? Shoot me. Even if you're a bit further away than you'd like to be, your bullets still hit and they burn me down if you just keep shooting. +While you're in wraith form that gives my cooldowns precious time to recharge; because you can't hit me either. So if you're going to pop that I hope you have a plan. And don't slowly float up to me. I know what you're going to do. And I'm going to send it back in your face. +I love killing you with your own death blossom. If you wanna pop ult, either do it when I'm far enough away so that I can't get close without taking damage, or do it RIGHT over my head. I'll be dead before I can react. Also dont forget, in death blossom you still have your healing factor. If you've got an orb on you or you're already in it killing my team, I can't out-deflect your healing. Doomfist+Don't waste rocket punch. If you telegraph it, I'm just going to jump out of the way. Then when I know its on cooldown-- dash and burst you down.+You aren't going to hit me with your ult lmao. Just...don't bother. Pharah+I can hit you in the air, but its such a pain in for me to do it than unless you're floating low to the ground, or you're REALLY annoying, its honestly not worth the effort. 9/10 times I'll pretty much ignore you. +Your ult is like, ridiculously easy to kill you with. I can easily just rush in while you're doing it and pop deflect an kill you. If you want ot safely ult-- do it directly over my head and MAKE SURE you catch me in it, or make me waste deflect first.+Pharmercy is my nightmare. Because now not only can I not kill you, but I can't even kill your Mercy; which is my main job.Sombra+Ok. Listen. I know you love hacking me. I know the satisfaction you get seeing me jump around in panic. But if you're gonna do it then you'd better make sure you kill me because I am going to be TRIGGERED and as soon as my abilities come hack ohohoho you are dead unless we're in a room where you've hacked that healthpack. +If you want to 1v1 me, throw your tanslocator down somewhere. Anywhere. Preferrably behind me. You can do it while invisible too. You might tick me into camping it or confuse me, or be able to teleport and take me by surprise-- dont underestimate it. But don't just run at me. You have to catch me off guard then burn me down. +You can make my ult useless. Not just with EMP. In order for me to get ANY value out of it, I have to get a kill then dash to my next target. If I dont kill, then I can't dash. But if I can't dash-- then I can't kill. Your hack takes away my dash. So even if I'm ulting and I get a kill--- I can't get to my next one. I'm basically just jumping around slashing at nothing.+You are a hard counter to me. Don't be afraid to focus me. It's gonna make me really angry and I'll probably hunt you down at one point, but stay invis, take me from behind, and MAKE SURE you either have a hacked healthpack in the room, or have an escape. +if I SEE you, Im gonna just start spamming you. I know damage interrupts your hack and if im hacked-- im jumping around and hoping your aim sucks.Torbjorn+I hate you. Like. A lot. Your turret is SO ANNOYING for me, especially since it can hit me when im not even close. And since I can't heal myself and because I'm a flanker-- going into a fight with anything less than full health already puts me at a disadvantage/makes me nervous. Chances are I'm gonna kill your turret first. My shurikens have no dropoff. I'll probably find cover, spam until its gone, or stay out of its LOS and take it out with a dash/alt-fire combo while it's focused on someone else.+Because I hate you, if I see you close to me-- I'm coming for you. you're so easy for me to headshot with my primary fire. I know you're probably gonna drop some armor to save yourself-- im counting on it. Your headshot/alt fire is pretty dangerous to me too--- but I'm probably gonna deflect it, dash through you, then alt-fire into your back. Unless you're confident...don't try to 1v1 me. Just let someone else deal with me.+Molten core is a nightmare. Increased damage, increased rate of fire-- if it doesnt kill me then it makes it so I can't really do anything until it's over. Depending on the placement and how good you are-- your turret is either a minor annoyance or im screaming ""CAN WE [I]PLEASE[/I] KILL THE ----ING TURRET"". Junkrat+You are so annoying. So ungodly annoying. I'm probably going to focus you first in all honesty just because you can 2-shot me, kill me without even meaning to, and you're a big threat to my team and probably the reason why we can't push or take the point. I'm relying on deflect. I literally will not even go for you unless deflect is up. Expect this. If I run at you-- I'm going to deflect your bombs in your face.if I drop down in front of you-- I'm going to deflect your bombs in your face.As soon as you see me, expect me to deflect. Bait it out of me. Because I'm expecting you, out of reflex/habit, to spam me. But if you do-- You'll probably die. So don't be so trigger happy if you see a genji coming at you. Bait that deflect. Then commence with the spam. A Genji without deflect against a junkrat-- is a scared ninja. +I can kill your riptire. It's not easy, but I can do it. If I land enough shiriken and dash-- I can kill it. Chances are though I wont know where it's coming from in time or won't even see it. +If I'm caught in your trap; I'm EXPECTING you to come and try to kill me. So I'm going to wait until I see you/someone and then Im going to deflect to try and save myself. Then run away. But, your trap lasts longer than my deflect does. A lot of Genjis will deflect as soon as they land in it out of panic. If I get caught-- it's an easy kill.Bastion+If you play enough then you already know what I'm going to do. I'm gonna attack you, you're gonna turn and out of instinct/habit start shooting before you can help it, then Im gonna deflect and it'll one-shot you. You already know to stop shooting for 2 seconds and make me waste it-- then kill me. +If you're in sentry mode or your back is exposed, im gonna alt-fire into your head or dash through you and jump around spamming you.  In all honesty, I'm your hard-counter. So unless you're camping in a nice corner or being pocketed [which you probably are]-- you're gonna have a hard time winning a 1v1 with me.+In tank mode I'm either going to stay away from you or deflect your bombs and kill you. It's VERY easy for me to do. Don't shoot at me. Mei+I might try to kill you just so you can't kill me/arent a threat to me anymore. Your secondary fire-- I'll probably just dodge. Your primary fire-- I'm well aware you're an ice demon so I'm not even going to come close enough to you unless I'm confident I can land those headshots or bait your cryo-freeze. Take me from behind when I'm preoccupied with someone else or jumping around/not paying attention. I don't think I'll be dumb enough to just run up to you and let you freeze me, but if I do-- free kill. Unless I dash away in time.+If you go in your ice block I might camp it and say ""Hello!"" or just run away. If I'm camping it-- I'm gonna headshot/dash as soon as you pop out. Unless you can get that wall up. +I can deflect your ult, but I probably won't just because you aren't really someone I want to be focusing. But still, toss snowball at the ground and unless I'm right there and expecting it there isnt much I can do.Hanzo+BROTHER!! You're an easy kill for me if you're standing off somewhere by yourself [which you usually are]. When I get close, just know I'm going to deflect. I'm ready for that scatter/panic-shot. Shoot at me when deflect is down. I'll probably dash/alt fire through you. I'm your hard counter so unless your aim is good [which it should be], you're gonna have a hard time.+I CAN actually deflect your ult, but I have to literally be right there before the dragon forms. I'm not saying it's never going to happen, but it has such a short range to travel before it's a dragon and you'll probably fire it on point when I'm not even near you-- I wouldn't worry about this.+Sonic arrow is your friend. You're an easy kill for me, but unless you're just being a nuisance I'll probably just ignore you and focus on people in the fight. Shoot it at the obvious flank routes if you're worried about me coming for you. Widowmaker+If you see me standing still, out in the open, directly in front of you and looking right at you-- I'm sending that bullet right back in your face. It's bait. Don't take it.  Instead shoot me when I'm jumping around in the fight. I have a very predictable jump/falling pattern that makes me easy to hit for you. +Just like sonic arrow, venom-mine is even better because it not only shows you where I am-- but cuts my health down. If I get caught with that, unless I'm confident I can kill you, I'm probably just going to grab a health pack. +Just like Hanzo I'm another big counter you for, but you'll have an easier time against me so I'll be easier for you to hit and you have a longer range. Plus there are places you can hook to that I'd have to go out of my way to reach; depending on the map. If I dash in your face-- machine gun or hook away to charge up for a quickscope. Winston+Public enemy number one. I hate you. I hate you so much. You are so annoying lmao. It's not even the fact that you counter me, but it's HOW you do it that's so triggering. You'll jump on me, melee, then when I dash away-- follow me. Usually this is all you have to do to get the kill, but I've learned how to play around you to some extent. +If you're in a teamfight or at a distance, I'm going to be the main one focusing you down. Because you're a threat and I want you gone ASAP. If you're at a distance, you have a giant head and it's really easy for me to land my primary fire  into you. If you jump on me then, I'm either going to dash or wallclimb away since I know your jump also has a cooldown. +If you're on the other team you have to focus me otherwise I'm going to wait for the perfect time to swoop in and help my team burn you down because again, I want you gone more than anyone else. If I know you're preoccupied or can't reach me, or are low on health-- I'm going to try and get that kill so that you're out of the way.+There's nothing I can really do against your ult. Getting smacked around can kill me and it's annoying. With your jump cooldown decreased you can follow me and keep smacking me-- I'm pretty much a dead ninja unless I can just...get away.Roadhog+free dragonblade. If you see me and I don't see you-- hookshot melee. Every time. Because ONCE I see you and I KNOW you see me? I know you're gonna try to hook me. And Im either going to dodge and make you hit the corner at the last second, or delfect it away then get some cheap shots into you for some free ult charge. Or if you're low, burn you down and make you go heal. +I can't really do anything to you to be honest, so unless I know I have your attention, I'm just going to ignore you and poke you just to farm my ult back up.  +Your ult however is another story. Whole hog is ridiculously easy to deflect. Not only can I kill you with it, I can also push you back with it and knock you off the map. When you're ulting I'm the safest. You can't hookshot me. You can't heal. If I can't/dont deflect it, I may try to dive in and burn you down. DvaFree Dragonblade remix (ft. Nicki Minaj)+I'm waiting for the missiles. I know you're going to use them. So chances are I'm going to run at you or drop down into your face and wait for the Dva spam-- then deflect it all back to get you out of your mech.+What wrecks me, is hyper-aggression. RAM your mech into me so it knocks me back [and does damage], spam your rockets, spam your bullets, use melee--- its so fast and so overwhelming I don't even have time to react and does so much spike damage at once, you can oneshot me. +You're also another ult battery however. Unless your aim is good I can jump around you and just keep spamming shuriken into your mech. Make me waste deflect and keep tracking. +There's nothing I can do against your ult aside from get out of the way. And against my ult, unless you're already low/out of mech, I'm not going to waste it trying to kill you. Zarya+I want to be close-range to you while you're distracted. If you're even moderately charged and have good tracking, you can kill me without many problems. So more often than not I will get directly behind you in melee range and alt-fire into you, or directly above you and jumping around. Even then, I literally cannot stop your beam, your bubbles shield against all damage, so unless you're a massive threat where we all have to focus you-- 9/10 I'm going to go for someone else. If you see me though, you are one of the people who can just follow me around and kill me quickly-- or make me run away.+I can deflect grav but I probably won't, unless you fire it from a ways away and I'm right of it. When it comes to dragonblade, its not worth it to waste on you. though on the opposite end, you can easily kill me while I'm ulting.   Orisa+You're big, you're slow, and your hitbox is the size of Texas. You also fire projectiles. I'm going to get in your face, directly in front of you, and send every last one of them back into your head. You're an easy target for me once I'm behind your shield. You don't want to 1v1 me, just because it's so much easier or me to hit you than you to hit me-- I'm probably going to kill you first.+Instead, fire at me from a distance and use halt to suck me into focus fire. I can deflect halt, but I probably won't waste it on that. If I'm close to you, I have a huge advantage. At mid range, behind your shield, is where you want to be. +Your ult is terrible :/ sorry. As soon as I hear ""CEASE YOUR RESISTANCE"" that's my cue to dash through your shield, through your drum, and fire shurikens into it. I can take it out very quickly-- bodyblock it. Put your shield DIRECTLY on top of it and stay with it so that I can't get to it without coming into your line of sight. Since I'll be focused on that and not on you, that's your chance to burn me down.+Depending on the situation, the team and I might just hang back and let the time run out. Reinhardt+Your hammer does 75 damage per swing. Swing it. So many reins will just stand there with their shield up while I jump around spamming shurikens into their back. I can't do anything to your shield, I don't do enough damage to make it worthwhile. If I want to do anything to you-- I have to dash through it and get in your face.  And when I'm that close-- your hammer can end me. It can reach me in the air. You do a LOT more damage than you think you do. You can 3-shot me, just be aggressive.+If you want to charge, don't broadcast it. A lot of reins will see me, charge, then I'll just jump out of the way and spam them from behind. But just like with the other tanks, you're someone where it's not really worth my time to focus-- unless I just want some ult charge. Even then, your shield negates that so I'll probably just ignore you unless you're low. +Don't firestrike me unless you're at point blank range, I'll just deflect it back through you/your team or move.+Earthshatter, I can't do anything to, but chances are I'm not even going to be with the team when you bring the hammer down. Dragonblade-- swing the hammer. When it's sword vs hammer: hammer wins. You out DPS me, you just dont have any mobility. Mercy+Listen. You know what's going to happen. I know what's going to happen. But you are not as helpless as you think you are. When you're by yourself and cant guardian angel--- pull out your pistol and start shooting at my head. One, it catches me off guard because most Mercys will just panic-jump while I kill them. And two-- it might make me waste a deflect if you're accurate. And three-- sometimes you can actually kill me first.+Most of the time I'll dash through you to get to you. Shoot. Jump around. Let your health regen while you take mine down. There's not a whole lot you can do by yourself. If you can-- guardian angel to somebody else and let them bodyblock for you. You have a 2 second cooldown-- I have a 7 second one. If I can't kill you on that dash and you escape? I'm screwed. Behind your whole entire team. +If I dash into you while you're whole team is there-- chances are I'm gonna ult. If you have valk-- Pop it. You can fly out of range where I can't do anything to you. This will also help your team, because if I can't kill you then I'm gonna do the next best thing and go for your second healer [jk there are no second healers lmao], or some other squishys[/b]Lucio+You are pretty hard for me to kill, harder than Mercy, because you move faster than I do and I'm not a hitscan. For me to do anything to you I HAVE to be in your face or landing my primary fire. Even then, if I'm far away, your healing song helps you regen all the damage from that before I have a chance to finish you off. You're someone I have to kill quickly but you also have the tools to run away from me.+If I dash into you, boop me away, then speedboost. Wallride. Jump along the walls or into your team-- you are HARD for me to hit. I have a 7 second cooldown on my dash and I can't really deflect damage back into you because you're skating around too much. 1v1ing you is like...the worst stalemate depending on the map.+Your ult counters my ult. If you see me or hear me, drop the beat. Yes I can burn through it but only if I want to kill you and just you. Chances are I'll realize I can't do anything and will be stuck in the middle of your whole team, and try to back out. Zenyatta+MASTER! DIscord: yes. But don't waste time with the alt fire unless I'm midair. Otherwise I'll just dodge or get behind a corner or something and make you waste it, then dash in. +Just like Mercy-- aim for my head. I'm going to try to deflect all of your damage back into your head. Honestly I'm probably the hardest counter to you in the entire game, but don't just give up. Move around, mix in melee, use some primary fire and some [not fully charged] alt fire. Up your sensitivity so you can keep up with me.+Your ult pops almost instantly. If you hear me, pop it. I can't do anything to you or your team and its one that I can't burn through. Ana+Between you and I it's basically a game of who has the better reflexes. When you see me coming, I know you're gonna throw that 'nade at me or try to land that dart. I'm ready for it. So unless I'm midair or have already deflected-- save it. Wait until I'm close range then throw it at the ground. You'll heal yourself but also anti-heal me. +If you can, there's the 'nade, sleepdart, rifle-shot combo. You're not helpless granny. On the contrary, out of all the healers you probably have the most tools to look out for yourself. But you ARE an easy target because you'll usually be way back by yourself sniping into the fight. +If I'm ulting, sleepdart is your only chance. You have no mobility, and you have the only support ult in the game that doesn't affect you as well. Moira+Auntie Moira. Use the succ. The succ is arguably the best thing against me in the entire game, aside from symmetra's gun. If you use that and toss out an orb; whether it's to damage me and burn me down quicker or keep yourself alive-- You should be able to win. The orb is slow, and I can deflect it, but it's...awkward for me to do it. I have to basically chase it, let it damage me, then hit it; but by that time it's already used up most of its power so unless I catch you right when you toss it out-- deflecting it doesnt do much for me.+You also have fade. You're completely invisible and have time to either escape or flank me and finish the job. +If I pop dragonblade-- toss that damage orb and fade. I'm not going to waste my ult deflecting it and probably won't even notice it in time before it burns me down some. Fade and escape or use the succ.I'm not a god at him by any means so take all of this with a grain of salt, but I do hope it was at least somewhat helpful. If you've noticed, throughout this post, the one ability that keeps popping up-- deflect. Deflect deflect deflect.+Make a Genji waste his deflect, his survivaility and effectiveness is cut in half.+If he dashes in AND wastes deflect, that is when you pour damage into him.+When he ults, don't panic. Shoot. Yes run if you can-- but shoot. tell your team to shoot. You can kill him. I have died in the first 2 seconds of dragonblade plenty of times by just a mccree flashbang, or a junkrat bomb, or a reinhardt pinning me to the wall-- you can do it. And there you are. This is how a Genji player thinks, fights, and some things you can do if he's really giving you trouble.","

"Sorry, I agree with some of your points, but not the one about counters.  The problem is that no one can reliably counter Genji (not saying he can’t be killed by them) because he is so overloaded with escape routes (wall climb, double jump, dash, deflect).  Mei definitely doesn’t counter any Genji who knows what he’s doing, because even though she goes through his deflect, she has no reliable mobility counter.  The best Genji counter (imo) is probably Winston, but even he is not hard to escape from as Genji.  I think his counters could use a little more than a small buff to be able to deal with him.","

"Mercy main here. My only problem with Genji is his deflect hitbox/animation, which you did mention as something you can concede with. I think if the devs fix that, he will be and feel much more fair to play against. Getting killed because you shot something you can't even see is really frustrating and kind of senseless.A lot of the issue is also that while Genji has several soft counters, his only hard counters are Moira, Winston, Symmetra, and Mei. Symmetra and Mei can shut him down the most effectively in my opinion. This is pretty reasonable on paper, but Mei and Symmetra are F-tier and never see high-level play, and Winston is often occupied diving the other team instead of playing bodyguard, so he won't necessarily be setting out to ruin a Genji's day unless he decides to focus on that. I think this is why Genji is so consistently effective, and it creates the illusion that Genji has very few hard counters and is OP. The real problem doesn't reside in Genji himself, though: it resides in how underpowered his most direct counters are.Mei and Symmetra need to be buffed instead of Genji being nerfed. I think that and perhaps a deflect hitbox change would be all that is needed to keep our favorite cyborg ninja in a healthy place.","

Racism makes it easier to fight/kill enemies.  It is a product of war.  Psyching troops into thinking enemies are monsters and easier to kill.You see her slowly changing her views in the comic.  Overwatch is inclusive and has some realistic plots.  I like how they still convey these issues but in a more acceptable form.  There is a bunch of symbolism in gaming with modern problems.  It's not exactly 1:1 but many games have participated in this in some form.For example instead of labeling a struggling minority today the story sets it as omnics (robots something today we don't see as human).  It also has double sentiment cause in the future we may have these issues arise.  We have an ai deemed as a person in a foreign government and it totally wants to kill things.,"

"Tanks have started to run into the same issue as supports: they nerf or rework any tank that becomes too prevalent and they end up as a weak off tank or a DPS hybrid like D.Va. That means if four members of your team go DPS and you feel obligated to bring a 'main tank', your choices are limited. Obviously that means you'll run into people who just don't like the choices on offer and therefore refuse to play them, but I also feel like the two options, Orisa and Rein, suffer from the same issue of being absurdly easy for fast moving flankers like Genji and Tracer to run circles around. They require not only a support to be there to back them up but also for the DPS to keep their back clear. Especially Rein who would have to drop or turn his shield to deal with a flanker and might leave the rest of his team wide open. Given the issues in the support category right now, I imagine you also have more games where people don't want to play a healer and tanking feels absolutely pointless. I know I've actively come into matches saying 'ok I'm not healing this time' and then no one else picks up the slack. Or if they do they pick someone like Ana and proceed to miss every single shot or get murdered by the ever present flankers or blocked by enemy shields. We've reached a point where if you don't run double healers and double tanks, you're limited to about two selections that actually serve as their role intended and can protect their team/solo heal:Tank: Rein or OrisaSupport: Mercy or Moira That isn't fun for anyone.","

If I'm not willing to play tank for whatever reason, why should I expect another to? There's an old adage -- do not expect of others what you are not willing to give.Your condemnation of others gets us nowhere. The real issue when it comes to hero selection is that while playing with others should be a matter of give and take, the community as a whole is all take and no give. Refusing to play the role while demanding it of others is a losing proposition. I prefer to be the change that I wish to see.

"With the latest patch, some people noticed that the reload on doomfist's cannon is... weird. I guess it was due to the fact that some hero changes slipped into the live version, like the mei one and the sombra one. These two have been removed, i'm not sure about the doomfist one.The doomfist weirdness is the following, the first reload after shooting all 4 bullets is 1s long, as opposed to 0.75s which it was supposed to be. But the next 3 reloads take about ~.66s instead of .75. The total reload time is still at 3s for 4 shots, but the reload times are just not as they were.Also i'm not sure what happens if 4 shots are fired, 2 reloaded and then 1 fired, will it take 1s to reload because it is the first one to reload after a shot? i am not sure, but if it is like that, that's a nerf. All these changes are unintended is what i think, i just wanted to share the info.Here is a gif for you to see: https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableSharpAmmonite?speed=0.125","

If your playing as mercy in that situation you have two options. Fly to the farthest teammate you can to get the hell out of dodge, or die.RMB is not an accurate move. Its a horizontal spread.

His ult is very forgiving but it does consider planning. The advantage that he really has is his double jump. His ability to jump all around you and attack you easily while you attempt to follow, I'm sure in Ana had a double jump people would be complaining too.

Never completely irrelevant, but you get my point.An ult that can wipe a payload or clear out the enemy's supports is usually better than one that acts as a crutch for situational awareness and slightly inconveniences Tracer mains. 1- There usually isn't more than 3 people on the payload ,the ult can still have use there , it can even be useful against the people on the payload for some headshots (I.E. payload is turning around the corner ,you have no idea if they're infront or behind the payload, infra-sight gives you an alert if someone's head will pop up soon)2- IMO it just becomes even better depending on how good the widowmaker is , you don't normally just know that the enemy is currently about to peak around the corner ,with infra-sight you get a chance to react to them and INSTANTLY kill them as soon as the head pops out (before they get the chance to see you)a good widow can take advantage of this and always hit the mark ,a normal widow could probably miss that , I know you said ''never completely irrelevant'' but I feel like you're underestimating it a bit3- I agree with you here, though it should be obvious why widow doesn't have that(her gun)I'm by no means a good widowmaker, I don't have much playtime on her either, I'm just stating my opinion on why I think it's not a bad/underwhelming ult like many people think it is (Maybe that's why I think it's a good ult ,because it helps me get easy headshots lol)","

"It's a great ult. Unfortunately that dirty arrow peasant gets it as a regular ability. I understand that Widow's is map wide, and the arrow peasant's is not, but being able to have walls on the important chokes without alerting the enemy through most of a game is a bit stronger than a 15 second ult that most people stop and use their wave and/or dance emotes for until it's over.","

Because Widowmaker mains are selfish people who doesn't care of their ultimate actually helps the team a lot.

"02/11/2018 02:52 AMPosted by Scynt1. It is helpful to snipers, but seeing as there is only 1-2 in the game, that is a very limited benefit2. Even if it is helpful to snipers, most widows are still not *THAT* good to really make use of it and pick off every person that peaks around a corner.3. Most of the time, you will know where the majority/all the enemies in the game are already, they are at or around the point.  Its a running joke in most games I play if a widow activates her visor, during a teamfight with 11 people on point ""Don't worry guys, we know where they are!""4.  Aside from most of the enemy team being visable, it could help with flankers, but it won't (unless they are bad flankers).  Announcing to the enemy team you've just activated your wall-hack means anyone that was going for a flank will stop and delay it for 15 seconds.So basically, all it does is make flanks wait around for 15 seconds, and help out the very few  exceptional widows and Hanzos.All valid points. I wish it would allow her to penetrate barriers for 50% damage durring it's duration.","

"Aside from learning the game and its heroes better, something that will immediately help your performance is making sure your peripherals aren't holding you back.A larger mousepad with a better sensitivity will do wonders for your aim, and of course make sure you have mouse acceleration turned off.A monitor with 144hz+ and a graphics card to get you to that fps helps immensely, and I mean it. Being able to see motion twice as clear as people with 60 fps is a huge advantage that will have an immediate and clear impact on your own performance.I'd also recommend a little stand to hold up your mouse cord so it doesn't get in the way or rub against the edge of the table and pull on your mouse (they're very cheap).","

"So what I do for the characters I want to get good at is every time I load up OW is play a deathmatch with the hero I want to practice before I do any quickplay/comp. Here I'm shamelessly focusing on aiming and dialing in my aim settings as well as creating a custom crosshair for that hero. I main all healers so I typically play healer in deathmatch so I'm already at a disadvantage WHICH IS GOOD. When you play Ana and are fighting 3 genjis and 2 tracers in close quarters with nobody to nanoboost it makes regular matches seem a lot more manageable. My friends in the following quickplay are then all like ""whoa dude you keep sleeping that tracer!"" and it's like well yeah I just had to fight an army of them so only 1 tracer feels like a blessing haha. Here I'm trying to expose myself to as much game stress as possible so I can think more clearly when I'm in those heat of the moment fights. There's tons of tips and tricks and this is just one tool I use out of many to keep improving and also getting a fresh new take on the game. Deathmatch locks you into maps with restricted areas so you become intimate with those parts of the maps which again helps you even more when you run into those areas in quickplay/comp. Also the easiest way to get better is to record you gameplay and ACTUALLY go watch it, not just save a bunch of clips lol. You'll be able to focus on analyzing your gameplay rather than focusing on trying to win and stay alive which will reveal to you all these simple silly mistakes that you wouldn't believe you're making. It could be bad positioning, aiming at your target with projectile hero's when you should be leading, etc. I try to never be satisfied with my performance even if it's 5 golds with Moira, theres always something I could be doing better. Did I get gold damage/elims because I didn't heal the dps enough so they could get theirs? I'm still willing to admit to myself that after 600 hours of Overwatch and all these wicked games that I still practice bad habits subconsciously and identifying those habits is how you get better. Yeah my aim could be better but rather than ""getting good"" i just try not to be bad and that will lead to better performances. Also watch players that are better than you at your hero. Doesn't have to be pro but open up your mind to alternate play styles and positioning. Hope this helps","

"The ""most successful idea"" for Scatter Arrow as far as just changing the ability drastically was to make it a high speed, single bounce, can't bounce off floors change.The idea of a reset your cooldowns being a new ability he could do got me thinking about self buffs. Scatter provides a close range ability to not immediately be at a huge disadvantage. Widow has hook to get away, but Hanzo exchanged the evasion for a way to fight back more effectivelySo my thought: do the changes for scatter to make it a better sniping tool with faster speed and single non floor bounce. You need this to keep ""simple geometry"" to not be janked out of his character. Give him a brand new ability on his reload key/L2 if on console. ""Sake"" he drinks some special ceremonial Sake or something and gets a self buff. Buff: For 6 seconds, emody the Shimada way. Gains 50% movement speed increase and becomes harder to detect by the enemy. Explanation of ""harder to detect"": normally the enemy team has a glowing red outline on their character. It gets rid of that for the duration. This allows him movement speed to quickly get to sniping positions, or get away from enemies. Making him harder to detect, as you have to pay attention to the character and cannot rely on the outline is also beneficial when sniping as not being seen allows for easier shots and fits the ""sniper"" character. With the new high speed scatter arrow, the 2 go hand in hand forming a nice way to make one another more valuable as long range sniping wasn't as viable due to slow projectile speed.If anyone from Blizzard reads this, even if you disagree, I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Why it sounds good or why it wouldn't work. I really would like to see scatter stay in some iteration or another as ""simple geometry"" is all over the place and also because I honestly just love the changes I wrote above after hearing the possible change of a self buff and that new scatter arrow.","

Even without a lot of damage, if you were already hurt then moved behind a shield to be safe, you would suddenly die despite believing you had made it to safety. On top of this, in many maps there would be areas that the skill, due to low ceilings, would just have no use at all. This would make it a net nerf when he really needs buffed overall.

People like to spar and show off their skills and it's better they do it in 1v1 than in comp, right?","

"What with the recent heroes being released and updates for new heroes coming out more and more answers for Genji keep popping up. Here are some changes in place/changes on the way that directly hurt Genji since OW came out.Junkrat: extra mine, also team is removing if Genji deflects it it won't harm him/Genji's team. Also also the change making it where Genji can't dash through the trap was necessary at the time but could be reverted at this point if we are looking to make answers to Junkrat more viable.Ana: Genji can't deflect while in his ult animation so sleep is a hard counter if landed.Sombra: Hack/EMP. Also upcoming change may reduce hack time to 1/2 a second not 3/4 a second which is pretty huge considering Genji's ult takes a full second to cast without any form of animation cancelling.Doomfist: All of Doomfist's kit, with some nuances, can't be blocked or defended by Genji.Mercy: Granted she is getting waayyy toned down but her ult is just another Zen like ult. Unless Nano/Dmg boosted it's very very difficult to kill a Valk Mercy or the team she's all healing through your dmg.Bastion: Got a big survivability update with the dmg reduction and self heal.DVA: has way more kill potential against Genji now with Rockets and the constant dps she can output wiith her guns.Roadhog: The changes are nice and really not complaining on this front, but his survivability now with his vape make it much harder to finish him off when He's low, just have to re-kill him basically if you win the initial duel.Moira: Another hero that Genji is weak to. The self heal + constant dps at a rather generous range with not a lot of effort to aim to begin with makes her incredibly hard to deal with.Couple of bugs/problems I have found with Genji. I've noticed I have a lot of moments where I will reflect, I will hear the animation activate and possibly even hear bullets get deflected, but I will still take damage and even die if I am low enough. This may just be a matter of split second ping but it happens consistently enough I'm not entirely sure. Another Issue is a lot of times when dashing as Genji the trail left behind could get hit by a stray Junkrat grenade and damage/kill me. It's like Genji exists in all frames of that line for a second not just point A to point B and any bullets/grenades that hit that straight line also hit Genji. Bug? Weird programming? It happens a lot if not atleast once a game.Proposed changes: really not looking at any dps buff but survivability. 1) Give Genji Invulnerability frames during his dash. Allow it to be used responsively to incoming dmg or Ex: if he dashes to a Junkrat, the 1-3 grenades in the air hit him but wont hurt him, or he ""ghosts"" through them not hurting Genji per-se but still could hurt anyone behind him. 2) While Genji is deflecting he is invulnerable to splash damage/beam damage. This one is a stretch but may be the slight bit he needs to keep him up to any auto targeting sym/moira/winston/junkrat/pharah. Also if he deflectsa Pharah ult he can't accidentally kill himself (also quick note I think Pharah should not dmg herself with Rockets/Ult like JR).3) Reduce Genji's ult cast or allow Genji to animation cancel his ult cast with E (deflect).As the years go on Genji has only ever seen nerfs and changes that impact him and his playstyle negatively. In no way am I saying Genji is weak. Obviously he has great combo potential, and his playmaking is up there with Tracer/Widowmaker. Throw these changes in the PTR and see what happens, but I really feel Genji needs a little pick me up, especially if th eupcoming new hero is yet another answer to Genji.","

"Bugs I've also found playing Genji more: - deflect is unreliable: ex. i deflected a zen's full orb set, damaged his shields, while I died; McCree stun completely RNG on whether I get stunned regardless, he gets stunned, or the stun vaporizes, dying against projectiles during deflect, game not registering fast enough turning to face new projectiles- player position updates on server hurt genji more than others: ex. see above (facing while deflecting still registers as fire from behind), dashing into players still registers impacts at point of dash- AoE deflected damage hurts genji: ex. i deflected an ulted bastion point-blank, splash damage killed me in one tank round, while junkrat is free to spam grenades and even saw survive his own ult in close proximity to riptire detonation- wall climb a bit unreliable: ex. i try a wall, nothing, i try 2x times without changing my position left or right, he climbs- dash cool-down not resetting reliably on kills: ex. at least one time I got a kill, feed showed me getting the kill, yet I couldn't dash again","

No. You're getting down-voted because you make yourself sound like that guy that would say ""Switch off ______"" before the match even starts, before giving them a chance. And that's already piss poor teamwork. Maybe you're not that teammate that does that, maybe you wait and give them a chance, and ask them politely to switch. But if you're the former, where you ask them to switch before seeing how they do, then you might not be a good teammate, either.","

"When you TELL or DEMAND someone switch, they rarely switch. They'll keep it to spite you.Try SUGGESTING it or ASKING NICELY without being a douche. If they still don't swap when asked nicely, then deal with it. For all you know, the other team is handling a troll in team chat that then decides to throw the game because they demanded that he switch rather than ask nicely and deal.You can't control the other players. Sure, it's annoying to lose because of someone not playing to full effectiveness, but grow up and deal.","

No ult from hacked healthpacks? For just slightly reduced spray and hack time?Goodbye neverplayed hero who got nerfed for some reason02/08/2018 01:30 PMPosted by Geoff GoodmanHere are the complete changes (so far) for Sombra that we are looking to test out soon:* No longer gains ult from health pack healing* Weapon Spread decreased by 10%* Hacking speed increased from 0.8s to 0.65s* Hacking will disable more abilities. Basically any ability that requires a button press will also be disabled. Here is a list:Genji - Double Jump/Wall ClimbPharah - Hover JetsHanzo - Wall ClimbLucio - currently running Crossfade song will be disabledMercy - Angelic Descent,"

Is totally the oposite. She will be very more picked. You is not a true Sombra player. You don't deserves play her.,"

"It shifts her role from a heavy support by building EMP for the team in no time flat, to a more solid solo DPS . She's still a saboteur role by her design, yet this new change allows her to be a better flanker with the decreased spread and stronger denial of passives. She might be better to 1v1 opponents now instead of waiting to finish off weak opponents.In other words, she's more true DPS character now.  The problem now is that it might make her too powerful considering.  Blizzard said they didn't want her to be an assassin role, but these changes might make that happen.  It's a big buff for her, but it also means a massive problem for supports.  They gotta deal with Tracers and Genjis to no end already, and this makes their roles even harder.","

"I know it’s not super important, but I thought it was an interesting note. We know for sure Genji is ambidextrous leaning on left handed due to him leading his dragon blade with his left and writing with his left in the Valentine’s Day comic. I’m not totally sure but a few things lead me to believe he is similar to Genji. He always shoots with his left first, and in the old soldiers comics he is seen shooting jack with his left hand, leaning to the side for his left shotgun to do work. He also punches jack down in that same comic with his left.  Also, in the Infiltration short, he spins to shoulder with his left hand instead of shooting the dude on his right with his right.In the animated short “Recall” he aims up and shoots down the capsule that crushes Winston with his left. I imagine if he was right handed dominate he probably would’ve picked his right to do that.In the animated Overwatch trailer at the museum, reaper often leads with his left. There are also plenty of sprays showing reaper leading with his left, including the cute spray and “psst”.In the death blossom animation, reaper skins left, shouldering his left gun and then crossing over with his right instead of vice versa.Again, not a huge deal but it seems he is one of the only if not the only left handed hero next to Genji.","

It’s a character building thing and I wouldn’t put it past blizz to have put something that subtle in.","

"One more small thing to add that might be a dead give away: the location of reapers ammo belt. His extra shotgun shells reside on his left hand side, his belt buckle on the right hand side. This is peculiar. Looking at McCree (who is right handed), his extra ammunition is located on his right side. I’m not an expert on guns, but I believe this makes it easier for him to reload with his left hand while he holds his gun in his right. AKA reaper reloads his shotgun with his right hand and holds them with his left. I could be totally wrong on this, but it is noticibly different than the usual place for spare ammo I.e. a right handed ammo belt. I actually looked at some of the character models from the Fallout games to see if my assumptions were correct (as I wouldn’t even know where to begin to look for that kind of ammo belt). The characters in fallout (NCR veteran rangers) all have their extra bullets closer to the right hand side. One could argue about soldier 76’s bandolier location, but I always thought those things on his belt and left arm were the canisters for his biotic field. again, I could be totally wrong.","

Arya Starks actress from Game of Thrones learned to sword fight left handed because it was important for her character in the novels. I’ll leave at that because spoilers Let’s not forget all storm troopers in Star Wars are left handed. In Rogue One, the main antagonist is also left handed.  The film name doesn’t come to mind right now but there was an underhanded businessman (antagonist) that had his hair parted over his right eye as one of the hints he was left handed.

"I’ve seen a lot of Symmetra, Torbjorn and Bastion players go on attack in CTF. Why? Since there’s a new instant pickup system, you can’t rely on your turrets to stop the enemy from getting that flag. It’s annoying when you lose all because the defense heroes aren’t on defense. Some heroes like Junkrat and Hanzo are the exception, because they don’t really rely on self-shooting turrets. Junkrat’s mine+trap are both based on the player, and Hanzo doesn’t have any of those types of abilities.

Remember that you have a lingering heal once someone is sprayed. Use your healing orb more often than your damage one because it can supplement your resource healing.

"Moira is basically a healer who needs to dps in order to be able to heal :)* align as many targets as possible in front of you* spray your LMB. It heals 80 per sec (and 17 hps for 3 seconds when switched off)* if you need more burst healing, click skill 2 > LMB (when you'll be comfortable with her, save it for more urgent situations when you need AOE heal). (It lasts 10 sec, heals 75 per sec, and disappears after 300 hp healed). If your team is not in danger, prefer RMB instead of LMB. It will send a damaging orb instead of a healing orb. (Damage is 50 per sec, and disappears after 200 total)* Both types of orbs will bounce on walls, so when you'll want to optimize your game, you can first imagine its trajectory in your head before sending it to make it last the longest time possible on targets (may it be for healing or damaging). It's just like a pool game basically. The most optimal environment to send an orb is indeed a closed area* when everybody around doesn't need heal, or when you're out of heal resource, search the nearest enemy, keep a safe distance of 5 meters, and focus your aim on target while holding RMB. It does regen slowly your life over time (30 hps). The objective is to stick your crosshair on target the longest time possible. This particular mechanic is what regens your heal resource* Your ult is a straight, channeled beam that goes straight in front of you for 8 seconds, that both heal allies and damages enemies. (Damage is 70 per sec, healing is 140 per sec). It pierce shields and have a range around 15 meters long (twice Mercy beam approximately). It also heals you over time (50 hps, something like mercy's regen under Valkyrie)* This ult seems to be stronger over time, so you'd prefer to save it until you're sure that a pack of allies or enemies is aligned and cannot escape (combo'd with another crowd control ult ideally, but not necessarly as when you play Moira well, heal constantly, and damage as much as you can, ult charges up really fast)* Her ult is not burst damage enough to force a team to split, most of the time they'll try to tank it. So it can be used either as a big AOE heal, either as a push trigger. Most teammates will gain confidence when they see Moira ult, and take the opportunity to be more aggressive. It's quite effective on payloads attack, a bit less on capture point (where you prefer to use it for mass heal, or combo with another ult for damage)* skill 1 is an excellent escape and/or dive in ability. Every 6 seconds, it allows you to position yourself without being seen, and without being affected by anything (damage/altering effects). It nullifies anything on during travel time (Tracer bombs, any ult), but any effect returns back once you're uncloaked again. It takes some practice to time it well* Her dps is the lowest in the game (50), but its consistency and leeching power (= able to face a target without retreating) can make you top damage without ever wanting to dps. Just train your aim to have at least 35%, it will be sufficient to be effective* ideal targets are 200/250 hp. Whatever is above will put you at much higher risk. When you want yo secure a kill, just send a damaging orb, but remember orbs are not regening your heal resource and that you'll have to wait 10 seconds for a healing orb. It's her part of decision makingShe's really enjoyable, independant thanks to leeching, I hope you'll like her as much as I do :)","

"Moira is a short range healer. You need to be close to your team to heal. Stay with the tanks. You won't be healing any of the flankers while they are flanking or any of your DPS that are out of position. Try to keep an orb up at all times. Look at your other support. If you have a friendly Mercy, you can use damage orb more often. If enemy has a DVA don't toss a damage orb unless she is out of mech. Prioritize healing over damage beam. Damage beam primarily use for recharging your pee pack or finishing off a squishy. The damage itself is very low. It's more profitable to sustain your DPS and let them put in the work. Stay at a safe distance from enemies while you are recharging your pee. Try to save fade as an escape tool. It can get you out of a lot of trouble especially avoiding multiple enemy ultimates. Consider if you have to use it to reposition yourself closer to any dying allies. If you can save them then it would be worth it. If not you may be a sitting duck.","

"I would tell you a lot of really fancy tricks I do with Moira, but lets start with the basics first. You are a healer/damage hybrid. Your healing gauge is increased by you dealing damage, so striking a balance between dps, and healing is essential. The gamesense to be able to pick between the two comes with practice,but you should start picking it up a little bit after 2-3 hours of play. Here is one more ""advanced"" thing you should learn. Fade jumping. If you jump while using fade you can get much more distance then normal. Alternatively, you can jump before using fade, and then jump a second time after hitting the ground for a little more speed. In addition to this, if you time the jump right on certain objects you can propel yourself high into the air. Here are some examples.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q67ldXyRGjk These can be tough to pull off, so practice them in the practice range first.","

"Focus on healing, I kinda play a little ways back to mid, using healing orbs is really most of her kit, don't entirely focus on damage, alt fire not orb, do it often to keep up charge I usually only use it against tricky mobility heroes tracer, genji, Lucio, low flying pharah, the soft lock is really good and you're most effective against the lower health targets anyways. Damage orb is really strong definitely use it but remember that healing orb is just as or more useful. Also if nothing is going on teams are regrouping etc just throw out a healing orb it'll bounce around for a while so it'll stick around till it cools down so it's worth sending them out as much as possibleFade is one of the coolest abilities in game and having it on a hybrid dps support is amazing. Almost anything you want to do is enabled by fade, avoid an enemy, run across a hallway without being hit by spam, heal somebody on the other side of the point, contest a point till your team gets back usually I'll throw a heal orb touch the point fade off touch again somewhere else healing orb then either my team is there or I'll heal enough to live till fade cools down and my team will likely be there by then, counter a lot of ults like dva, zarya, tire etc. Get comfortable with fade bc it really does enable you to do almost anything","

"The most basic yet most important advice for playing Moira is: don't waste your resource. Don't overheal. Mercy has infinite healing. You can keep that healing beam attached to your target indefinetly without dire consequences. With Moira it's quite the opposite and if you aren't used to paying attention to it, you might find yourself in situations where you're healing when it really isn't necessary. If someone is on full health, don't heal them. If the team fight is over and you have several seconds of peace, use your orb. If your resource is wasted at the start of the team fight, you'll be forced to dps when your team need the heals desperately. Pay attention to how often you're healing with your main resource without it being necessary. This will improve your resource management drastically.","

Also even if they did just adjust the character model to make the puppet model one can simply copy the 3d model without the codes attached to it.

"After spending a lot of time this week playing the game mode, I thought i'd share some thoughts that I've had.1) Communicate the rules to players in a better way: I don't know about you, but when I used to play capture the flag both in real life and in other games, a team couldn't cap the flag while the other team had their flag. The way the current cap and flag return systems are completely un-intuitive until after you've played a few games.2) The changes to movement while carrying flag: Find a way to better communicate that you can't use these abilities while carrying the flag. Perhaps just disable them after  you've picked up the flag? For outside abilities like zarya bubble, make the flag carrier un-targetable perhaps. I've had numerous games where people start asking in chat why they used a winston leap (or other ability) and it dropped the flag.3) Map pool: I played a bit of CTF during last year's event, but honestly I don't know how people enjoy playing certain maps in the current pool. I've noticed a huge difference in enjoyment of games between the various maps. The good maps, Ayutthaya and Illios (mixed emotions). The bad maps; Oasis and Nepal. On Nepal, the area around the flag is so easy for certain heroes to defend by themselves. It requires a pretty coordinated dive to actually grab the flag and escape (unless the lobby isnt balanced). Almost every game I've played on Nepal has gone to sudden death because it's just so hard to break in to the flag.4) Hero Balance: CTF and the current maps lend themselves to a few heroes that are considered extremely strong atm and whether it's a change to the maps or the heroes I'll leave that up to everyone else. Sym, lucio, junkrat are really strong. Roadhog is quite strong as well. I see these 4 heroes in almost every game that I've played. I think part of the imbalance is due to people not understanding the game mode and how it differs from quick play, but overall there is a pretty big imbalance I feel.I'm sure some of you will disagree with what I've said, but just sharing my personal thoughts.Cheers","

"I flex between dps and the dps-lite supports(Ana, Moira). People on these forums are just biased. Supports and tanks dictate the meta but there is far more sympathy for support players especially after the Mercy debacle which I feel went on long enough that it heavily divided the playerbase into distinct ideologies.Support impact controls this game even when in game it doesn't feel like you have an immediate and tangible impact. What a lot of support only players don't get is that the complaints come about because they don't personally feel like they're doing much when everyone else can recognize that they are. For example most Mercy players were in heavy denial that she was overpowered until her pickrate literally became 100% and it was no longer deniable. People in general should play all of the classes so they don't get stuck in this bubble that essentially mirrors real life racism. You have people stereotyping and saying everyone who plays a certain category of character is the same. Not even a specific class but the wide range of characters are somehow all the same. Stupidity.","

"One idea:Doomfist holds his gauntlet out in front him which blocks all incoming damage in front of him. Damage absorbed is returned to Doomfist as shield health, capped at 200 shields, making his max health 450 with shields. 3 second duration, telegraphed with sounds and bright electric particles. Only the handcannon can be used during this ability. Long cooldown probably necessary, but essentially he can build up shields before going into the fight, or try to use it to survive after going in and using his abilities. This would also replace his passive ability.","

I know this isn't a priority, but if this isn't going to be addressed then the real question is why do we have it in the first place? This feature lets players know that they are performing optimally, that they are doing something. Mercy is the only character where all of her fire meter was tied to her ult. I believe the reason you haven't fixed it yet is that you either don't know how to give fire meter on things of value with Mercy because her entire kit is now just assists or because it just doesn't seem to matter.

"Okay, fine, I'll bite... In this sentence ""Shoots a bullet that will chain up to 3 players if it hits dealing 15 damage to each player"", what do you mean by ""chain?""  Will it ricochet to another player, or does it punch-through the target in a straight line to hit targets behind it?""Dark Blue"" health is shields.  They recharge once you've stopped taking damage.  The highest HP of any non-tank character is 250... so your proposed 300 HP means it doesn't fall into any pre-defined category, and certainly not a Support.  150 HP would make a lot more sense.Smoke bomb: Ok, maybe they'll do some sort of LOS-blocking mechanic eventually, but I doubt they'd tie a stealth mechanic into it.I just plain do not like the shift ability.  This isn't TF2, and I really don't think we need a ""Spy"" archetype yet -- if ever.  We've got a few characters with some of those elements, but the disguise mechanic doesn't seem like it would fit in too well... especially since ammo is unlimited.  (In TF2, one is wise to shoot every teammate, to make sure they are not a disguised spy.  It works for TF2 because ammo is limited.)And for the mine... It seems to only be useful for particularly oblivious snipers?  Who else would be standing still for 10 full seconds and not notice an enemy behind them?As for the Ult, well, same deal as with the smoke bomb: as a way to obscure LOS without blocking projectiles?  Sure, fine by me.  But granting invisibility to characters within it?  Unnecessary.","

"So after foolishly trying to become an Ana main in low silver and dropping to an abysmal 1300 SR, i got my !@#$ together and made some changes. I messed around with my setting so i had solid frames, got my internet fixed so it was more consistent, started doing aiming drills almoat every day, and went back to playing dps heroes. Things were looking up. My aim was better then ever before even if im atill bad and i was getting hundreds of SR every day. More importantly my gameplay felt much more consistent, meaning i felt alot more confident about myself in general and thus played better. Before this my biggest hurdle was being overly critical of my own performance to the point of where it would ruin my day and completely destroy my self esteem, so i was feeling pretty good about being able to move past that. But after i got to around 1850 SR i ran into my newest hurdle, which you have probably already figured out is smurfs.I realize the topic of smurfs is controversial and im not saying there is never a justifiable reason to have one. Useing one to learn a new hero because your regular rank is too high makes sense to me, but the sheer amount of smurfs that i seem to run into at this level compared to just 100-150 SR lower is mindblowing. I also understand that both a new player that has tons of dps experience and is just better is a thing, and that random games where you do great with a hero you never play occasionally happen, so chances are at least some of the time when i think its a smurf, its totally not.Lvl 83 hanzo that is landing almost every single shot with 7 hours on his profileGold widow no star that is completely destroying the team with 6 widow hoursTracers who are one clipping me that have 6 hours of playtimeGenjis who obviously know what they are doing because of seemless and accurate ability use as they destroy everyone, all the while sporting an impressive 13 hours of total genji playtime.Im running into these people every 2 or 3 games on average, and sometimes 2 or 3 games in a row. This isnt an exaggeration, and it doesent seem to matter what time of day i play. Also, its not uncommon for these people to be a gold rank with no stars thats duoing with a bronze or silver player. As a dps player its even more frustrating because when i recognize what these players are doing, i have no choice but to always try and focus them every single time they are around, because if i dont, they will kill everyone. If i turn around to shoot a flanking sombra for 5 seconds when i turn back around the entire team is dead and im about to get steamrolled. So not only does it make me feel extreemly constricted (because then i feel like the team is counting on me to control the smurf even though they are much better then me,) but when i fail, i feel like the loss is my responsibility. This gets 10x worse once the smurf identifies me as a threat. Bonus points if i manage to kill them instead of just do enough damage to make them retreat. Once this happens, the smurf will single me out and force me to duel them. Over. And over. And over again. And every time i lose they will walk away and kill everyone else. This compounds the feeling that its my inadequacy thats loseing us the game.All in all, betwean how it changes a match and the sheer amount of times it happens, its really starting to put me down. How does one overcome this hurdle? Does it ever get better? Also i want to mention that i dont care what team the smurf is on. Im not any happier over winning a match i dont deserve because we had a widow smurf that terrorized and ruined the enemies game then i am about getting destroyed by one. It takes the fun out of the game for me no matter what. What should i do, and why in the world are so many people purchasing this game so many times??Sorry for spelling, grammatical, or formatting errors i did this on mobile.

"Hey Everyone!I am a huge Overwatch and Halloween fan. It's my favorite Holiday and Halloween Terror always makes me giddy when it comes around! However, last year I was hoping for a bigger expansion on what Blizzard had built in 2017- I know it's pretty entitled, but as someone who isn't very good at the base game of Overwatch and loves hanging in the Arcade I was just craving a bit more than Aldersbrunn again. I have some ideas- a wishlist of sorts- for what could come around next year! I'm not expecting anything nor do I want Blizzard to feel I don't adore the work they have done and the amazing effort that they put into every aspect of their game. This is by no means negative- entirely just my ideal event for next year! New Skins: Sombra- Invisible WomanDoomfist- Swamp MonsterMoira- MummyHanzo- Wolfman/WerewolfReaper- Slasher (I know he's already gotten a legendary each Halloween, but why not make it a tradition?)D.Va- Jack O' Lantern [Epic] (De-Meched Dva can be wearing a skeleton costume with facepaint)The Haunted House: Taking place on a Halloween-skinned Château Guillard, this would be a wave survival, with infinitely spawning waves of Zomnics creeping from every corner of the manor, as the Survivors try and get as far as they can. Powerups can drop around the map, including Nano boost, Ult-filler, Instant rez, damage boosts, speed boosts, clip size increases, Zomnic distraction lures, and the like. Each wave more enemies spawn and become increasingly stronger, and the game only ends when all heroes are dead. Dying means not respawning until next wave, but teammates can collect rezzes throughout the match that they can save you revive you. However, they can also use them on themselves on death, creating an Altruism/Self-Preservation dynamic. Every few rounds a boss round will begin, spawning a random Junkenstein boss. They're be more of a relaxing breather round at first, but as the rounds increase in number the Bosses will start spawning alongside regular Zomnics and at the same time. Also, some new bosses could be thrown in as well! Based on the Skin ideas above, I think Sombra, Doomfist, Moira, and Winston would fit well. The Chateau map is already pretty well suited for a creepy makeover, turn it into night and add an eerie fog over the lake, creepy rotting aesthetics all over and a secret lab in the basement. Idk how many players/what heroes would be the default for this, but probably similar to Junkenstein with mostly DPS characters and an Ana.Curse of the Pharaoh:Basically the same as The Haunted House's wave survival game mode, except on a smaller scale map. Keeping in the vein of Classic Monster Cinema that Junkenstein's Revenge and Return of Junkenstein set up, this would take place on The Necropolis, with Zomnics being slightly redesigned to be mummified in bandages. This would be fun because you could have Reaper/Junkrat/Roadhog/Moira as Tomb Robbers who have been cursed for upsetting the ruins, similar to how Ana/Soldier/McCree/Hanzo take on different roles in Junkenstein. 80's Slasher: The coolest part about Overwatch Halloween Terror is that it's been themed around Horror Cinema. However, just because they went with classic monsters the past 2 years doesn't mean they don't have to stick with that forever. Imagine if they rethemed the event to feel like a 1980's Slasher film, with an oppressive synthwave techno theme and a dark grindhouse feel! For a game mode based on this idea, they could do some sort of Reverse Yeti Hunt, taking place in a foggy, swampy Campground a la Friday the 13th. Give Reaper a cool hockey mask Slasher skin and have the other team of heroes try and sneak around and avoid him while collecting items to escape. So what does everyone think? Does anyone have any other ideas for what to do for this, or any other event? I know it's a lot of work and I love it when the games come around again every year, but I'd love for Blizzard to expand on what they've started making!Also- please bring back event playlists for map reskins! 24/7 Eichenwalde and Hollywood during Halloween is my dream!PS please reskin Ilios for the Summer Games, it deserves it.","

"With the upcoming buffs to Hanzo (faster draw speed, and climbing with arrow drawn with reduced cooldown) can we talk about Hanzo's Scatter Arrow, please?As I understand it, the scatter arrow was originally meant to deliver some damage when someone's hiding inside a room or tunnel. But now, Hanzo's scatter arrow is mostly being used to oneshot enemy heroes by shooting it to the floor, that is aiming to deliberately missing the shot, and kill the enemy hero by multiple scatter arrows shooting at once.Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqgnp0cmj0UNow, the thing is, this technique can be used to oneshot anyone from pilot D.Va, Tracer, to tanks like Zarya, Orisa, and also Bastion. Using this on Roadhog, although it doesn't oneshot him, it takes out a significant chunk of damage, about 450 health.One-shotting tanks is no way for a hero to behave in any game.450 damage is probably the biggest one-shot (non ultimate) damage in the game. Not even Widowmaker can deal that kind of damage. (her headshot at full charge deals 300hp damage, that is 150 less than Hanzo's scatter arrow)Now, the counterargument to fixing this is usually that because Hanzo is 1. a popular hero, and that 2. he's an unrealiable hero. But it's actually not that hard to oneshot people with scatter arrow like this, as the hitbox is fairly large and you don't even need to hit any specific spot on the floor to allow for a one-shot kill.[Removed]Thank you.Calling out individual developers or the development team in your title or post is against our forum guidelines.

"Yesterday I had a high ranking Widowmaker on my team in competitive. Nothing really seemed off about him at first; he was nice and worked with the team. It was when he popped off and headshot-killed 4 enemies in less than thirty seconds that I started to get suspicious. Turns out he had a 70%-ish winrate on Widowmaker, and admitted to being a smurf when I asked him. I continued my questioning, slightly irked, and this is what he had to say: ""I play on this account either when I'm warming up for my main or when I'm drunk... and I'm drunk a lot.""Turned out that his way of ""deranking"" was giving the account over to his brother who naturally brought the account's SR down from gold as he was a silver player.Seeing as this particular player is one of the many smurfs and derankers I've come across in competitive play, I learned something from interviewing him. These people see the low ranks as a joke. My role in this community, in the eyes of the elite diamonds, masters, and grandmasters, is to be warm-up fodder. I'm here to be made fun of in Smurf Deep Dives to Bronze! YouTube videos for my bad aim and clumsy plays. I'm here as easy entertainment for drunk diamond-rank Widowmakers.Please, tell me how that is fair? I'm not saying that these people are the reason I'm stuck in silver. I know I belong in silver; I'm not being delusional. But, explain to me how being carried, or reversely getting steamrolled, by a high rank player is supposed to be fun or challenging?

I know this might be an unpopular opinion but shield should definitely drop the flag. Whenever Winston has it and he is running away his shield can be a blockade that can give him the boost he needs to get away almost every time,"

I'm fine with mobility abilities being the only way to drop the flag. Some tactical play has to be available because simply walking away with the flag doesn't always work too well.,"

Whenever Winston has it and he is running away his shield can be a blockade that can give him the boost he needs to get away almost every timeWith the Bastion/Junk/Torb (pick 2 of 3) that seems to be there every game, you need some sort of defensive ability + Lucio to do anything, and you often need high healing on top of that to get out consistently. You need to give the offense some sort of ability to get the flag or else it ends in a stalemate every game.","

"Well...i can kinda understand this. Junkrats Ult is pretty much controlled by him. So when he dies the tire should be gone or not be controllable anymore. Meis Ult is something else, because she pretty much just sets her lil robot out there to do his own thing. No player control in there. Same with Ana and Sombra because they buff/debuff people and that is a set timer without any form of control from the player beyond the use of the ult. Following that logic i would say that the Widow ult should also be gone when she dies, since she uses her goggles to wallhack and i always thought it is strange that the ult keeps up, when the one causing the wallhack is waiting for the respawn. Orisas ult is not controlled and like a turret so i guess i can stay after orisa is gone, but its easy to destroy anyway. Lucios ult goes away pretty fast by itself so no need to make that go after he died. I still don't know about Torb and his little turret Son, since both get buffed up. When he dies his buff is gone but the turret still goes on. i guess that's a pass? I just do not know if the turret buff should be always the same as Torbs buff, or if both should be seperated from each other. I guess the way it is now with them is better so Torb won't just hide while ulting.But why am i even trying to say something about that, when this game buffed Dvas ult by letting Dva survive her own explosion, while Tracer still can get blown up by her own ult. Junkrats try to hide when ulting because they want to be alive after the ult, but there's a little bit too much reward in the ult the way it is now. Making them mostly do it whenever in the next corner. When you are lucky enough to find a Junkrat you should be able to kill him and erase the ult with him. This only makes Junkrat players play more defensively so they try to find a good spot or only use the ult when they are sure there is no danger around, when they wanna survive. I like playing Junkrat from time to time, but he is just way to easy to mindlessly spam around not giving a care in the world, because stuff is bound to explode and the Ult charge is built up really quick. He can be like that for all i care, but his changed ult is just a little treat for him. It's too fast on maps with corners, making the counterplay that was intended (shooting it) really hard because by the time you see and react to it, it's pretty much in your face.In short: Junkrat could use that kind of change, since it makes him think twice when and where to use the ult. There is just enough easy kill potential in his kit. Other ults like Widows could also use that, making them try to survive for as long as possible.","

"Strengths, weaknesses, roles, etc. As a long time Reaper main I have a few thoughts, but I'm interested to see where others see Reaper in the ""meta"". I'll list off a few points.- Strengths; corralling tanks, assassinating healers- Weaknesses; Literally every attack and defense hero (in varying degrees and situations of course). Shadow Step. - Use Case; disrupting the back linesReaper excels at melting tanks, but it isn't easy in a ""balanced"" match. Poor mobility and range make it too difficult to attack dug-in targets. So this role is more reserved for those big brawls that happen around objectives. Otherwise I think sneaking around (with Shadow Step) is the best use for Reaper and assassinating high priority targets. It's always a gamble though. Generally you either pop that Mercy before anyone knows you're there or you have to flee.","

At lower ranks he seems to be a flanker. i'm guessing the disparity is just because he isn't mobile enough to really be a great flanker, but his damage is still good at killing things up close and playing with tanks/barriers is an easy way for him to get close relatively safely.","

"As a tank that regularly has to deal with him.His attack pattern doesn't sync up with his team. By the time he gets in position, the fight's already over and he has to hide while waiting for the next wave.Part of what makes Tracer so difficult to fight as Orisa is because Tracer engages at the same time as her team. Orisa can't shield dance with the enemy team on the other side of her shield and has to tank Tracer, which of course, she can't. Resulting in a melted Orisa.Reaper on the other hand, tends to engage the tank by himself since he's not fighting with his team. Orisa can counter him because she can atleast use all her abilities (including shield dancing) on him without getting shot in the back.Reaper needs to flank, but doesn't have the speed to actually do so (or the map doesn't give enough routes to make teleporting worth it)Again tho, I'm a tank, i don't use Reaper, so i don't know how to balance him. I just know how to fight him.","

He should be with the heart of his team most of them time and occasionally backing away from the front lines to teleport to higher ground and drop down ontop of a team fight already happening. He is an excellent duelist but not always one on one... i think the best way I could describe him is an awesome teamfighter because tanks (the things that are making space for dps in a teamfight) are afraid of him and if his tanks are doing their job then he can walk all over the enemy dps without too much worry.It's all about picking your engagements, if I am running into mcrees, sombras, genjis, doomfists /whatever in one v ones and im consistently losing to them its not a failure of reapers kit its because im picking bad engagements.I don't really care if people who think reaper NEEDS a buff downvote this because im just sharing my personal experience with reaper and how /unfrustrating/ i find it is to play him when i put some tactical thought into my approach. I do a dance with shotgun characters lately when I need them, sometimes I take a roadhog, sometimes I take a reaper... depends if I need to be defending my teammates more (roadhog) or if i need to be tearing the enemy up more (reaper).A lot of the ways I see people complaining about how bad reaper is at his role seem to get very frustrated that he's not performing the job they think he should do as opposed to the job his kit actually plays into. Brawling with the team on point, acting as a backbone.I like playing reaper a bunch so would I deny a buff? a quality of life change? absolutely not. does he need one to be viable??? ehhhhhhhh probably not.","

"Would like it if they combined Shadow Step and Wraith Form into a single ability. Basically make it like Moira's Fade ability but without the invisibility and controls like D.Va's Booster but without the boop.Give him a Smoke Cloud for his E power that obscures vision for enemies but not allies, even hide people from spotter powers if someone is inside it, including Widow's ultimate (reasoning being it'll only cover a small zone).Finally give him slug rounds for an alt fire on his shotguns that does less damage per shot but has better range.","

"30 years of FPS games and even after recent examples like TF2 developers still haven't learned that giving a low ranged hero no ability to actually get within effective range usually ends in disaster.Reaper can absolutely shred enemies to a ridiculous degree...but only in very specific situations like the back alleys on Anubis.  Otherwise he's useless.  He will get picked off easily if he gets caught outside of these CQC situations.  He's ironically a pretty good defense hero since he can just sit in these chokepoints and let enemies come to him, but not as good on attack for the reverse reason.Meanwhile not only can Tracer also shred enemies in CQC, but she has a far easier time closing the gap between her and enemies, and far more ability to escape from a bad situation.","

They do not always listen to the player base because they are designers, they weigh their own experience and ideas above the communities by a little and that us a good thing.If balance was based purely on player base ideas of how things should be, you would see some rediculous 1 sided balance changes.They care about overall game balance, not ""genji beat me once so nerf pls"" attitude.They still obviously listen to the playerbase a lot, but they trust their own direction as well, to a larger extent even, which is fine.","

"Yeah, I'm sure the Moira mains will race in here and downvote me, but this is my main gripe with her.She's a low skill, high reward character.One of the bigger things to be complained about in Overwatch is the high impact low skill characters like Mercy (little aim required, easy to benefit, etc).  So the latest hero Moira comes in with exactly that.  Her main healing is spray in pray.  Her damage you just gotta look in the general direction.  Her orbs?  Pick a direction and shoot.  Get in trouble?  Fade away!Not only that but her healing and damage is strong.  I've played games as her just using barely using healing orbs and barely trying to heal and still manage to outheal Ana or Mercy while coming in with gold elims, gold obj. elims, and even gold or silver damage often.Seriously Blizzard, I love the concept of Moira, but did she have to be so low skilled?","

"You understand nothing about Moira. Her damage output is the weakest in the game. Her beam does requires aim. You clearly know nothing about Moira. She does require skill as to when to use orbs and fade abilities. Fade at the wrong time, you cannot escape certain abilities or a fight. The healing orb is what makes up for Moira's healing as the spray is not that strong compared to other healers. Use the damage orb when it's mainly one or two people in a tight space. Not worth using the damage orb over the healing orb when experienced players know how to escape or run away from it. I can go on and on.","

"Moira has one of the higher K/D ratios across all platforms, and is easily the 2nd best healer behind Mercy (Stats pulled from masteroverwatch.com):PC: 2.92:1 K/D 11th overall in eliminations PG, 2nd place in healingPS4: 2.94:1 K/D 9th overall in eliminations PG, 3rd place in healing (About 200 less than Lucio)XBO: 2.94:1 K/D 10th overall in eliminations PG, 3rd place in healing (About 200 less than Lucio)The issue comes from her utility:She's very good at healing (distance healing of up to 15m)She's very capable of killing (long-distance latching of 21m)She's extremely evasive (<1s fade and cooldown of only 6s)A simple fix is to reduce the distance on her primary and alt-fire. Just from playing games in Deathmatch I've seen her whip Pharahs out of the sky and it's an ugly sight. I would hopefully like to see a reduction of primary/alt to 10m and to 12m respectively, forcing her to play much tighter to her tanks. In comparison's Symmetra's lock-on weapon has a 7m range with a 9.5m breakoff, and Zarya's Particle Cannon Beam only goes 16m.","
						Jan 1
					",,,,,,,
"Here's the thing, her healing can be some of the strongest in the game. This is of course assuming there is more than one teammate being heled by her spray. If there's only one teammate your losing quite a bit of value. Her kill to death ratio is practically meaning less. Her orb of decay latches on to any nearby enemy. If you throw that and all those enemies die to lets say a reaper ult you'll still get a point for eliminations, this renders her K/D ratio irrelevant. Her secondary fire needs looked at for the length of the beam, but it is in no way overpowered. It will still take you several valuable seconds to kill an enemy genji, mei, soldier, etc. Where as tracer can one clip 200 hp heroes. IMO i don't see a problem with her fade ability. It allows a healer to escape being killed by an enemy flanker. Tracers blink cooldown is faster than that, genjis is about the same and does damage, soldier literally has infinite sprint. Overall i think you have the wrong idea about Moira being a low skill high reward hero. If played right she definitely can make an impact on the game, but most people don't play her the way they should. There's a combination of decision-making, multitasking, and resource management that other characters generally don't possess.EDITForgot to add that her secondary fire has a very slight lock on. VERY slight. Its much like healing a teammate as Ana where you have that tad bit of leeway on either side that registers as a hit. Its not like full Symmetra microwave lol","

If there's a flying or height advantage hero Mercy would be stronger but if not Moira is better. Her healing output is also comparable to Mercy's so that's nice.She also can run out of heal juice which happens fairly quickly and the orb is a relatively long CD, so there is awareness and juggling required.","

"As someone who played 150 HP Zen a lot, there are a few things to really take into account.Options:1. Wait for another buddy to spawn.2. Switch to Lucio or Moira3. Make sure Tracer doesn't blink beside you as you strafe. Your goal is to be facing her as you strafe at all ties, and don't be afraid of meleeing after a shot if she's close. If you can force recall, you're in a good spot, but might still end up dying....which makes the other 2 options important. 4. Headshots with Discord and melee...but this isn't really helpful, since you try to do it anyway. For 3 and 4, just be aggressive and don't back-pedal. Get those shots to land with confidence, because that's the only time I EVER fend off Tracer.","

"There is no matchmaking in QP or Arcade, and anyone who says otherwise (including Blizzard employees) is full of it.  There is just no way a developer could program a system where it thinks that Bronze/Gold players are a match against Diamond or above without getting immediately sacked and banned from the industry.  Meanwhile, 18 months into the game it's still extremely common to be placed up against players who are double your SR.  I don't play comp, but at a guess I'd say I was around 1800-2k SR, yet I'm constantly in games with 3.5-4k players (had one a week ago against a 4300).  This is predominantly why I have simply stopped playing.  Imbalanced matches are just not fun (whether you win or lose) and I'd rather give money to companies who are willing to address major issues such as matchmaking.

And if they were better than us, well, we just... learned and got better at playing the game until we were on mostly equal footing.You millennials and your constant cry baby attitudes about wanted everything to be fair and equally matched. I guess that's what we get for giving you all participation trophies and tell you that it was okay if you didn't always win.It's all our fault for never wanting you to suffer through adversary or learning how to deal with it and eventually learning how to overcome your challenges.","

"02/03/2018 06:13 PMPosted by RockI've always been a platinum player (SR 2996 career highest). And these days I don't play Comp because it's just not fun, you get bad teams one after another.But to the topic at hand: I'm still plat, but when I play quickplay I go up against all the time diamonds, masters and grandmaster SR players. Why is this ? This is very unfair in my honest opinion. You can't just throw a grandmaster into the mix of platinum / diamond players. Basically a grandmaster SR tier player could be top 500 player, right ? And I'm a platinum player...it's like a casual player vs a pro level player.Anyway, is the matchmaking these days broken or what is causing this ?Dude I’m in masters and I’m playing with plats, golds, and even silvers sometimes in quick play.","

"Hi, I'm just re posting this to see if i can get any luck on some discussion or if any of the blizzard members could answer this question at this time or at all. I just want to discuss this since it's been frequently talked about before.I was wondering if someone could go in depth of any knowledge you know of a recontacting with Sony/Microsoft.I read a while back about a deal could be POSSIBLY drafted with Sony/MS when recontacting with their online services for data transfer for skins, sprays etc.This was a while again during the games release and contacts usually last 12 months-24 months just for example. From my Knowledge Hi-Rez and Rockstar Games was able to draft up this deal at recontacting.So, I was wondering if there could be any updates at Blizzard maybe looking into this when recontacted or if already recontacted recently since i have had a tough time switching to PC from Console and am curious if this is possible at all or false information i may have picked up on.Even if we could get some stats transferred would be nice since fan sites already have these stats recorded.It's extremely frustrating and difficult starting from level 1 again and trying to adapt from high level play back to the latter lowest levels with fresh players who are just starting out. I want to make my PC the main platform but grouping up is mostly or almost the only choice me and my boyfriend have playing together without a frustrating experience.I would assume solo players would find this even more difficult aloneOf course Skins are a big bummer to lose but I know my boyfriend is upset he can't get his cosmetics.Personally I 100% understand this side of things I don't mind putting more money into Loot Boxes and building cosmetics from the start since I love this game and like to support it.If we could get a discussion going to let me and others know if this is possible at all or not after time has passed since a lot of players are still hoping for the chance to obtain our lost items upon a switch.I understand if Blizzard are completely out of bounds with this but if we could get any information at all that'd be great thank you so much. :)","

"Junkrat's Tire does 600 damage, falling off all the way down to 60 damage over its 10 meter radius.Damage numbers are important here because you need to get as close as possible to tanks. When it comes to trying to hit both supports, you have about 6-7 meters to work with.The tire can climb the rooftops of several maps.Dont be afraid to explore with this thing. You have 10 seconds to work with, after all. A lot of the best tires in the OWL see up to 7 or 8 seconds spent just on taking the roof route.Junkrat is not controlling his tire.For those who think he should lose it when he dies because he controls it... he doesn't. The fantasy, keeping in line with the character, is that he just lets it loose to run rampant, while he covers his ears. The player only gets to control it for balance reasons.The tire can use sprays.This is mandatory knowledge. Write it down, people. Take notes.","

"When I first started the game and only played casual I only played 2 heros: tracer and junkrat, and only 1 gamemode, quickplay. Then arcade mode was introduced and I started to play 1v1 random heros. That gamemode gave me a proper understanding of all the heros, their abilities and limitations. And because of that I was able to flex in comp more and go from silver to plat. Now we only have select gamemodes and some that change everyday, and and 1 or 2 are always replaced with a new event, map or hero release.

"Ok, from the short to the gameplay I always loved scatter concept, but in the end, the ability felt just wrong, one-shot for no reason and pretty inconsistent when used to kill enemies in closed areas.I don't play Hanzo a lot (I have some pretty lousy aim), but I like to speculate about abilities and such, after a long time of discussion I propose my Ideas for the rework of scatter arrow:-Low the damage from 75 to 25 (charged and uncharged)-Hight speed piercing scatter arrows (pierce players not shields)I focused my attention on the base concept:A totally cool arrow that splits and ricochets all over the place, causing significant damage to all the players in a single room or an area;I hate to aim at the feet of players, I would like to use the ability in a larger room filled with enemies instead and have some more consistency in closed spaces.Here some other secondary Ideas:- Storm bow charge dramatically increase/decrease scatter speed note: this means that you can use the ability in more creatives way such use gravity to hit multiple enemies through the area- Scatter Arrows travel infinitely for a set time (for example 2 seconds).note: I like the Idea of a set amount of time because arrow that bounced in some corner can be useful and actually hit some targets- Maybe more pellets (like 8 to 12 instead of 6).note: just to balance the single arrows low damage and add some consistency in bigger rooms, I really like to see that little arrows bounce all around, is just fun!That's all, here some other idea that I have discussed but that don't feel right, fun or consistent:- homing scatter arrows- an arrow that scatters when hit an enemy and pierce him through- scatter arrows that bounce if hit an enemies- the first 5 meters the arrows do something like 10 damage- damage that scales with distance note: I feel that these are pretty silly ideas, some felt just like unfair free damage, some other is meant just to make ""foot aiming"" not viable anymore and that's not necessarily a good option and can make the ability less fun and fair for someone that like the ability as it is now.","

"a simple way of changing scatter arrow without getting rid of the ability altogether would be to make the arrows burst in all the directions when it hit a surface instead of bouncing at an angle. It would make it unreliable when shooting it at someones feet, wich is kinda the point, but i believe it could make it more reliable at hitting someone hiding in a room.","

scatter arrow is an interesting skill the problem is how it works. I play mostly tank  and it's frustrating to be one shotted by just aiming at the feet it doesn't feel fun or skilled.The scatter arrow as you say should be a skill used to hit enemies within close rooms or hitting enemies from different angles. By doing so you can have a reason to pick hanzo over widow. I agree with your concept,"

Mercy players are reporting being harassed for playing her and being told that they are throwing for picking Mercy. It's been such a short time since the nerf and already she is basically seen as a troll pick. It's too early to tell but its not looking good for mercy mains. Many are quitting due to the harassment and how unfun their hero is. That's not good. Maybe that might give the devs a hint something is wrong with balance but they don't want to talk about it anymore and just change the subject to other heros ignoring the elephant in the room. The feedback about the revert was good to hear but we need more. Mercy doesn't need any huge buffs just a small nudge in order to make her fun and viable again. Maybe 1 insta res or 2 cast time ones would bring her in line with other supports but currently any other healer has a better midfight and ult. I love mercy but right now even I wouldn't want one on my team I'm ashamed to admit.,"
						Feb 10
					",,,,,,,
"Until they Revert Mercy, the devs will continue to be met with these balancing problems, her pickrates will still be the highest in her class, she will continue to be horribly clunky, anti-climatic, and unfun to play, and the Mercy playerbase will continue to be bullied on playing their favorite heroes.... no matter what Jeff currently says. Feelings are temporary, but history and numbers don't lie.But let's hope I'm wrong and that they somehow find a way to make her both fun and rewarding to play again yet balanced... All I'm saying is that right now, that seems like a really difficult hurdle to get around for them for some reason, and It's slowly becoming more and more obvious that a Revert is the only true solution to the broken hero.... No matter how much they will try and disregard it.~Sincerely Yours xoxo, a Lover of True, Fair, and Fun Balance.#RevertMercy","

It appears that you play every team in your division, but only 5/6 teams of the opposite division.

You play 5 teams from your division, 5 teams from the other. It would make more sense to me if it were set up like MLB with divisions within leagues or the NFL where you have divisions within conferences, but that would require a lot more teams to be warranted.It bears mentioning that the MLB season is decided based on length and then the intra-divisional, inter-divisional, and inter-league games are scheduled.

"The only situations where Lucios capture flags and make it back are when enemy teams are not paying attention in which case it's their fault. In other cases it's the tanks that capture it and bring it back while being healed and speed boosted.If you're gonna remove wallride then you have to remove Genji's double jump and wallclimb, Pharah's jetpack etc.Then people would still complain that Lucio is a must pick because he can speed boost tanks and people would still ask for nerfs until they put a cap on run speed while holding the flag.In which case the game mode would become a lot less fun, Lucio and DPS players would become obsolete and the game would be dominated by tanks even more.","

"People are under-performing on purpose to get placements over with so they can earn their points at the end of the event because they know placements don't matter. Lose them all, win them all, you'll get placed the same rank as your current competitive season and the worst part is it doesn't even matter if someone is just walking around to avoid getting kicked out for inactivity (lost count of how many times I saw that today): they'll still get their usual rank average and free points at the end of the event. They also go 1v6, jump off of cliffs, ult in spawn, completely allow people to get away with the flag just so it ends quickly. Don't get me wrong, I know it is all supposed to be for fun and ranks shouldn't matter so much, but what bugs me is that I can't play with my friends of a higher rank and I'm forced to play with griefers instead, when in reality we should've been able to do placements with any ranks. I like the mode, I have fun in it when I'm with a good premade but holy jesus the amount of throwers is unbelievable. I'm not at all unhappy with my rank, I just sort of hate this kind of rank restriction during placements and practically useless MMR that allow lazy people to get away with it. Even if they place in a lower rank, it's still free weapon points and they don't care how they get it.Blizzard, I'm really thankful for adding another mode to get golden weapons (only 30 points away from my golden Tracer pistols!) but PLEASE consider not doing the whole restriction thing next time.

"I understand some people are getting placed higher, and I'm happy for you. I really am. What I'm saying is people who are simply just playing it to get it out of the way still get their regular rank from last season, which imo isn't at all fair.  If people capturing/recovering flags are getting more SR, then that's great but those who actually need the team to do that and can't do much because there's someone AFK near base or someone intentionally feeding - and they still get the same SR than those trying. Like I said, I'm not at all unhappy with my rank, it just feels wrong playing in a competitive environment like that just because it goes away in a month. If everyone had gotten a clean new separate rank I doubt I would've have seen such behavior frequently (and I would've been able to play with any friend).Still, judging by the replies and downvotes it might not be an issue as I initially thought, maybe I just had bad luck in my 2 accounts (20 games and literally only in 1 people wanted to coordinate). Again I'm glad some people managed to outrank themselves from regular comp, that's a really nice thing to accomplish.","

"Firstly I want to start off by saying I am by no means amazing at Widowmaker and my hours, win rate, accuracy are not the best. However recently I've approached playing her differently and I feel like my aim is actually improving. When first playing Widowmaker I would just try and get headshots, and would miss almost all the time. It was very hard, infuriating, and made me feel like I had no chance at ever playing this hero properly. After changing my sensitivity to one I was comfortable with around (24/25) I felt like I was more in control but my timing was still off and trying to get headshots was really hard. Now however, I'm not focussing on getting headshots anymore, but bodyshots and with this in mind my aim is actually getting much better. Not forcing myself to only get headshots was what made it really hard playing her. But when I focus more on bodyshots I find it a little easier to get headshots too. My timing is improving and so is my aim. So next time you play Widowmaker, try and focus on bodyshots moreso than headshots and maybe in time headshots will be much easier to get!","
						Feb 9

"Well, its true that its better to atleast hit the body so you do some damage instead of nothing at all, but if you manage to full-charge crit any non-tank they are out of the fight which prevents the chance of them getting healed possibly (and thus giving the enemy healers ult%). So if you do have the opportunity, you should try going for these crits. I can relate though, I would also rather get that bodyhit than missing entirely as im not that good with Widow either yet (and likely wont be for atleast a while)You have me wondering about your sensitivity, i mean 25 is like a bloody lot, especially for someone like Widow on whom aim is a key factor. What dpi do you use in conjunction with it? But ofcourse, everyone their own confident settings ^^","
						Feb 9

"Yeah, in team fights if you can deliver reliable body shots, team mates should be able to finish those players off pretty easily; which is why a lot of people like such call outs when you put them on low health.

As a diamond Widow my tip is to click heads.

Keep you honor alive even if it kills you!25 sens is extremely high. I would not be able to hit anything with that.,"

"i dont think dva should be able to detonate her mech if it gets destroyed. its a waste of an ult half the time, and it rewards bad play. Im a dva main since season 2, and i admit that i detonate my mech inside a small closed hallway just to get it back sometimes, but after watching my gameplay back and improving i realized how much of a waste this is. Or if they decide to keep the self destruct after its already destroyed, only give points based on damage done rather than giving dva a new mech. Now if she throws her mech on point or detonates while it still has some health, thats one thing, give her a new mech, but put in a small window of time during the animation of her ejecting from her mech where if she destroys it, she wont get it back unless she got enough hero damage with it to get her ult. This would tone down dva without making her totally useless. youd see less bad play as players are more cautious about when they take engagments.","

"02/09/2018 10:16 AMPosted by GreyFalconThey promised they would improve her if she was too weak. This is a worrying view on their part, as is the view that they need more time for the dust to settle to see if her current state is good. Her current problem is not a power level problem. It's a game play experience problem. It can't be diagnosed by looking at win rates, pick rates, or any other number. No amount of waiting and checking will detect it. It's noticeable if you like to play the hero, or if you listen to people who do. Mercy players are not asking for a more powerful Mercy. They're asking for a shift that will make her kit feel more dynamic and engaging again. I know that people feel like too much attention was paid to Mercy and that other heroes should have their turn, but the current situation is quite problematic. They took a well loved hero, changed her drastically in ways that her player community didn't ask for, then continued to do so for months at a time, and then left her in a state where she's significantly less enjoyable for Mercy players. Now they've decided to take a break and leave her be for a while. They started the rework process with a request for trust from the Mercy community. There was an entirely new direction here, a new and improved vision, and it was going to be more fun, more engaging, and healthier for the game. Over time, that trust has seriously eroded. The rework was certainly not healthier for the game, and she's become less and less dynamic and fun as time progressed, until we are left where we are now. A character who may (or may not, time will tell) be balanced, but has lost something of their soul and of their fun factor.  Mercy's kit has become the project titan of Overwatch. The only people who I've seen like the current Mercy are people who are interested in not playing her anymore.At this point, I feel like some trust needs to be re-established (probably on both sides). Some acknowledgement that Mercy's current problem is not a balance problem, and that thought is being put into fixing it.","

Build rez, and constantly analyze the battlefield for the best way to apply it.

What's your point?not really.. before the rework mercy felt very exciting to play. you could undo massive amount of ult uses.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IRp8E1TbPcit was FUN. it felt like you did something huge, had an impact. (even tho we didnt win the fight after that rez on the video.. the enemy still used mercy ult; grav; soldier ult, reaper ult). after the rework mercy was still kinda fun, since you were actually doing something during your valk. you would rez. it was op.. but you were not just flying around the universe. now your better off not rezzing during valk.. most time its too dangerous, its time you are not healing, dmg-boosting. mercys rez has no skill ceiling anymore.. bronze mercys do 5 rezzes, while grandmaster mercys do 6 rezzes. there is nearly no learning curve anymore about this abililty. thats making mercy unfun.. they should remove rez and give her an abililty she can use more often.","

Blizzard has no reason to believe the unfun argument as long as her pickrate stays high. You mean that 6.8% pickrate in competitive and 5.8% pickrate in QP for this past week, while her pickrates before the rework in those categories were 12-14%?That's a loss of half the Mercy playerbase since before the rework.https://www.overbuff.com/heroes","

Playing around mass rez gave you a purpose, and a game plan.  Build rez, and constantly analyze the battlefield for the best way to apply it.  If you were good at your healing job and staying alive, you'd get a lot of opportunities to be a hero.Now there are no opportunities to be a hero.  Constantly analyzing the battlefield won't make a difference to new Mercy, since there's little to nothing she can do to stop big (or even medium sized) plays from the enemy.  Old Mercy was a sidekick most of the time and a hero some of the time, but new Mercy is a sidekick 24/7.Everybody knows the ult has changed. I'm talking about, you know,the times when you don't have ultimate ready. That hasnt changed a bit. It actually had something added to it on E","

Like almost all heroes have around +45% +50% winrate it's a negligible difference. However Mercy's pick rate got cut in half do to the excessive nerfs. That's huge. Then Jeff says she's in a good spot and it's okay because she's still ""playable"" Imagine if DPS ULTS were nerfed as hard as Mercy and hard capped to two max kills only. DPS players would say its unfun and almost pointless. Their pick rate would drop like a stone. But technically the characters will still be ""playable""Jeff why not cite winrate/pickrate for Mercy in other modes like duels/deathmatch/unlimited/ctf not just cherry pick comp data to exaggerate Mercy's success to push for excessive nerfs?Also it was report recently that griefing is 17% down? Since the previous talks of Mercy nerfs and patch and changes, there's been huge surge on griefing support mains both in and out of game. What's the current grief reports now? Did the recent change on Mercy encourage toxicity and double standards?","

Partly because of people adjusting to the changes, and partly the re-ranking of certain players that might have had inflated SR due to extensive time played on one OP hero.She's also the second most played support in comp this week, only behind Moira. Things are normalizing out for her to be a pretty average support.Maybe they could try for a ""fun buff"" in Valk, but the heroe's balance isn't far off.","

I do think it's a bit pricey, but it just depends on your circumstance and how big of an improvement of a connection it'll provide. Sometimes finding a different route just won't yield faster results than what your ISP is already doing. But sometimes it does. Some other companies will also use different routes, but again you don't really know which one will work best (or if at all) until you try them.There's also invite-only networks that are difficult to get into.. One in particular runs a physical line through the ocean from California to the East, offering immensely low ping considering the distance.

But that would only be useful for Asia-only games like specific MMOs, of course.Doesn't a regular Cali-Asia connection already use physical cables? There are multiple cables across both Atlantic and Pacific, most of them owned by broadband corporations, so I'd be surprised if your normal connection wasn't using them.","

"Lately I've been grouping up with a GM friend (Fragehardt) for Arcade and Quickplay. He's really a cool guy, he is giving me a lot of tips/coaching to improve my tank game. But since he is a GM I've already encountered several OWL Pro players in Arcade. The most recent being Rascal from the London Spitfire. We were playing CTF. I started off on Reinhardt, but when Rascal started shredding our team with Tracer, I switched to Roadhog. Even though we lost the match, I did manage to hook/kill him a few times. feelsgoodmanBefore this I played against Dayfly From Fusion. Even though he is a support player, he was playing Genji and he completely destroyed our team. So much so he got bored and left. I'm really grateful and feel lucky that I get a chance to actually see some of these players in game. It's really incredible watching them first hand. It's feels totally different from watching/spectating them.  Have you ever played against any of these OWL Pros? What was your experience?","

"EDIT: I understand that this is likely expecting too much of a video game forum, but if you're going to respond, please do actually read what I have to say.I've never posted in the discussion forums before, but this has spurred me to. I really hate the new CTF mode. CTf used to be my absolute favourite game mode, I would play it every time it was available and I was so, so excited for it to come back for the Lunar New Year event.But I was horribly, horribly disappointed. The new CTF rules completely changed the way its played. It feels like there's no point in strategy or team coordination now; the way to win is with brute force.Having a required time spent on a flag without damage to capture it was great! It forced players to really think about how to approach the enemy. You had to come up with a strategy that would disable the enemy and enable one of your team members to grab the flag. You had to think of how to counter the enemy's defenses, as well as which team member was best-equipped to capture the flag. It required thought, quick-thinking, and teamwork.Likewise, allowing the use of mobility moves was fantastic! Again, it forced each team to really counter their opponents, to focus on preventing capture, and to have contingencies in place. At the same time, though, a highly mobile hero couldn't capture the flag alone without deliberate planning and great strategy. Both teams had the potential to use highly mobile heroes, so it wasn't really unfair. If the enemy team used such a hero to great effect, it was the job of their opponent to figure out a suitable counter.In the old CTF, a team had to decide whether to focus on attack or defense, or how to sufficiently do both. Teams had to coordinate and consider their moves and composition carefully to win. It wasn't perfect; there were too many draws, that's true. But there must be a better to solve that than to completely alter the game mode.In the new CTF, the new game seems to just be using as much firepower as you can to overwhelm the opponent, then running back to base. There's no real strategy; a team can't even split up because capturing or defending a flag with less than the full team is practically impossible. Only a few heroes are suited to capturing the flag now, most of them tanks or Lucio. Heroes like Sombra, Mccree, Hanzo, Widowmaker, Pharah, and others are all but useless now, when they could certainly have played roles in the earlier version. To add insult to injury, the only way to play CTF now is to either relegate yourself to a single map, which is boring, and results in basically playing the same game over and over, or to play competitive, which is not something everyone wants to do.Those changes, especially, point to what I think is the heart of the problem here; Blizzard is catering to only a specific type of player. This has been shown in many other actions they've taken as well: most notably, the disastrous changes to Mercy, but as well in the changes to Lucio, and the constant elimination and deathmatch games modes that dominate the arcade. The changes to CTF make a lot of sense if seen from a specific perspective: players who do not value or wish to engage in teamwork, who prefer personal victory and accolades to group success, and who find any strategy that does not involve them getting as many kills or points in as little a time as possible to be unacceptable will find these changes most pleasing.Many of the complaints about the first iteration of CTF came from these types of players. They complained that they could not win this mode with the mindset of a solo DPS player who refused to change their strategy to fit a given situation or to work with their own team. These are the same players who complained about Mercy players using their ults to counter team wipe outs, even though that is exactly what Mercy's ult is for, they knew that already, and did nothing to counter it even though it could easily be stopped. They complained, and Mercy was nerfed, and nerfed again, and again and again until she was all but useless. They whined that they weren't getting enough chances to show off their DPS skills until they got Deathmatch mode, despite the developers saying early on that a Deathmatch mode would not fit Overwatch and would not be implemented. These are players who care only about their own enjoyment, their own way of playing the game, and will stifle and shout down anyone who wants to play differently or in a way to which their unchanging style does not effectively apply.These players are loud, but they are not the only people who play Overwatch. Some of us want to work together. Some of us want the challenge to out-think our opponents instead of out-gun them. Some of us value the ""team"" part of ""team-based shooter"". We paid for our games the same as everyone else, and to shunt us off to the side because we don't loudly complain that there are modes of play that don't fit our proclivities is unfair. As I said, I don't usually write in forums; players are often so nasty in-game that I don't relish the idea of engaging with them in extended conversation. But I felt that I had to say something about this now, because this is the first change that has really made me question why I even play this game. This is the first time I thought, ""Wow. They really don't care about the rest of us. Maybe I should just uninstall.""","

I disagree with your wall of text. This latest CtF mode with it's dedicated map have lead itself to natural strategies. Even without voice communication in a quick play game I've found teams work out how to play it. The best games have a push and pull feel to them with action happening from one end of the map to the other. Team's switch from offensively pushing in for the flag to defensively falling back to defend their own. Players do have to understand when their team is losing the fight so they can fall back accordingly. It's a different style but the longer it stays around the more people will adapt and learn the basic strategy.,"

"I'm going to have to agree with the post above. Competitive CTF doesn't seem a whole lot of fun. I'm basically forcing myself to muscle through these placements. It's kind of disappointing because I feel another competitive game mode (such as CTF) could be a nice alternative to the meta style play that session games like OW are subject to.  Currently movement speed, tele's, and immunity abilities cause you to drop the flag, and I thought this was a great idea. All this has done though, has created this meta where you need Lucio. The match is basically wait out the 6 minutes till sudden death then quick Lucio cap; or a team just dives the flag and when they're distracted Lucio just grabs it and wall rides away. There is no way to catch him if he gets ahead of you.  Maybe, if holding the flag lowered your movement speed that would level the playing field.I also don't like the regular maps being used for CTF. The new map is great and a lot of fun with many ways in and out, but the old maps seem out of place for CTF. I think maybe experimenting with flag spawn points, or even just having one flag that is set up in a neutral location could make these maps more fun and viable.","

And now it's a completely different mode. And I'm so disappointed.

						Feb 10
					",,,,,,,
"So, I main D.Va. My advice is this. Some of these are obvious, but I will mention them anyway. The D.Va match up is hard for Widow. 1. Don't engage in a one on one. D.Va is still  a tank and will win. If she boosts toward you, run to your team. She is too weak to take on multiple targets at once. If she's dumb, she'll follow you and die. 2. Stay at as far a range as you can. Widowmaker has no damage fall off, but D.Va has to be really close to do damage effectively. I want to say D.Va can boost 20 meters. Try to be farther than that if the map allows it.3. Keep your team between you and D.Va. If she has to fly over them to get to you then she can't get to you without taking a lot of damage first. 4. If you have a Tracer on your team, they can split the D.Va's attention. Tracer in the back line makes D.Va need to peel for the supports leaving you free to shoot from range. If D.Va goes after you then Tracer is free to take out the supports. Either way, one of you can get kills while D.Va is busy trying to deal with the other. Pharah can also work to split attention since dealing with both of you is D.Va's job.","

"A D.Va is doing one of two things against a WM: She is either defending her team and eating your bullets, or she is flying into your face with a missile barrage and DM.The key to fighting D.Va is to keep track of her DM and her booster CD.If the D.Va is defending her team and stopping you from killing a priority target (such as a Mercy or other support), then you can just wait it out. This is especially true if you have a barrier of your own to prevent a WM or Zen from counter-sniping you while D.Va is blocking.Against a diving D.Va, you can drop down and hope the D.Va follows you so you can grappling hook back up and regain your high ground. This leaves the D.Va to be away from her support, without DM because she used it to protect herself flying into your face, and without a good way to fly up at you again for at least 5 seconds. Hopefully, you or your team can demech her before she can fly up again.The alternative is that you grapple to a secondary position (remember to always have an escape plan) and start sniping the D.Va who is in the open, without cover, and without DM. She is forced to either drop back or just try to dodge your (and your team's)shots for 5 seconds, and hope she has enough DM charge left to dive you again.If the D.Va ambushed you, that's just poor teamwork and you should probably tweak your sound settings to catch footsteps better. D.Va can't crouch in mech form so she's very bad at sneaking.","

If there is a concern that Lucio players will lack survivability if they want to use Amp it up for healing while holding the flag but can't, then make it so that if you switch to Lucio's Speed Boost song during the effects of Amp it up, he will drop the flag.  Please implement a change like this, Lucio is incredibly frustrating in this game mode.

"If Lucio uses 'Amp It Up' he drops the flag. Period. I keep saying this, but even if a Lucio uses his passive speed to dart off, it still shouldn't be an issue; every other player still has their movement abilities to catch up with him and almost every hero in the game has a ranged weapon to shoot him with. A Lucio not using amp it up speed, just passive crossfade speed, isn't that much faster; it's only 30%, which is pretty easy to catch up to for any other hero with movement abilities they can use. (DVa, Soldier, Winston, Lucio, Genji, Tracer, Reinhardt, Moira, Ulting Mercy, Junkrat, Pharah), or heros with abilities to 'stun' or 'pull' or 'stop' him (Roadhog, Mcree, Lucio, Orisa, Ana, Junkrat, Pharah). And of course any hero with a non-melee weapon can just shoot him. Sounds to me like the issue is not Lucio's speed; it's players who have never been particularly good at killing or focusing good Lucio players finally forced to face their own shortcomings. Lucio is super countered in this case by a Pharah, Winston or Dva, especially. A good Lucio player can be tremendous wallriding, especially once he knows the map well. Either get better at focusing a Lucio, or get better at wallriding and play Lucio yourself, because even without the speed, wallriding is what makes him pretty dominant in this mode.","

It doesn't work this way.  After 5 seconds have passed the flag is free to be instantly picked up.  I'm thinking that you're thinking that flag pickup works the same as flag recovery.  It does not.  Flag pickup is instantFlag cannot be picked up for 5 seconds after droppedFlag return is 4 seconds,"

"02/09/2018 03:35 PMPosted by SǾMBRUHHard to pull off and I don't know if this will work, but let me explainSo if your flag is at base: enemy grabs on on touchBut if your flag is dropped and needs recovered: flag must be captured before enemy can pick it upSo would it be viable, to keep the flag dropped, but very close to base? That way you can defend just as well, but enemy cannot 1-touch your flag.I used that strategy pretty often last night, actually. It's very viable if you're in the thick of a teamfight at your base to prevent a quick ninja of your flag during a teamfight.","

"What if instead of splitting into 6 ricocheting arrows on impact with a surface, it shattered into many shards, creating a damage cone? It's difficult to explain the idea, so here's a poorly drawn info-graphic I made to describe it:https://imgur.com/a/C8iUnThe damage within 2 meters or so of the impact location is 150, falling off to zero at 8 meters. It can still oneshot light heroes (125+150), but you have to actually hit the person rather than shooting the ground near them. If Shatter Arrow hits a barrier, it will deal 225 damage to the barrier on top of the 125 from the arrow, but no damage cone will be created.This replacement to Scatter Arrow will make Hanzo more capable against groups of enemies while also solving the ""shoot the ground for 400 damage"" issue. Since it is a little less potent, the cooldown may need to be lowered to 8 seconds or so.","

"I'm so tired of how people act around Orissa.  She has a nice, big, protect shield.  I know, it's nice, and safe.BUTWhen the enemy team has heroes like: Tracer, D.Va, or Junkrat (e.g., heroes that can literally 1 shot a hero), DO NOT GROUP UP.Orissa's biggest strength is: cutting a route off for the enemy.  Sure, they can burn the shield down, or they can go around it.  Yeah, there's maps like Hanamura where it's amazing to just hide behind her shield (while also being spread out, woohoo), but that's not always the case.For example, 'fight for the point' maps usually have tons of ways to flank.  When the Orissa sets her shield down, MAKE SURE HER BUTT IS COVERED.  She is literally protecting 180 degrees, the least you can do is protect the other 180.My last map (the purpose for this rage) was the Ilios Well.  To bring to light how competent our enemy was..  I literally managed to pull 5+ enemies into the well over the course of the fight.  But they had this Genji who kept flanking me.  Genji vs. Orissa..  yeah not the best fight.

Also Valk would not give her a free charge since it already gives her chain beams to help her charge another Res faster.","

"02/09/2018 07:52 AMPosted by HomerUmm, are we no longer able to customize practice mode so it's easy to explore a specific map?You want to do that in Custom Games.As to the main thrust of this thread, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1) It was September when Purrfait's portfolio was initially posted. Given that they appear to be a British national, that's a pretty short timeline for them to get hired on by Blizzard in the US and relocated to begin work on Ayutthaya. Not impossible, but challenging. 2) The purpose of the portfolio isn't to present an idea and to see that specific idea implemented in the game; it's a demonstration of skill and design sensibilities intended to entice a studio to hire those skills. So the notion that Ayutthaya couldn't have been designed by Purrfait because it's a temple and not the town in the portfolio is erroneous, since the sensibilities used in designing the town could have been used to design Ayutthaya. 3) That in mind, it's not impossible that Tara could be the starting point for a Thailand-oriented hero. I just find it highly unlikely that the (incomplete) presentation of her in Purrfait's portfolio would be implemented as-is.","

"Not hit-scan that would be OP.  I think they should simply increase the fire-rate and travel speed of the Caduceus pistol to make it more inline with how Pilot Dva's light gun behaves.  The whole rationale for eliminating the original Mercy 1.0 ""Hide-and-rez"" (per Jeff Kaplan) and adding Valkyrie was to make her more part of the battles.  A pistol change is inline with that goal.  It would give her a little more defensive capability and the ability to contribute to team damage in a pinch.  To be honest I think this is a fair concession given her recent extensive nerfs.  I think the nerfs were necessary for hero balance but she was gutted pretty severely.Also, I find it compelling that many of those poo-pooing a support buff on these forums have exactly ZERO hours in the most recent comp season on Mercy.  I am actually convinced that many DPS players will not be content until Mercy's ult transforms into a 10 second grand mal seizure where she repeatedly yells ""Bitte töte mich!"" (Please kill me in German) so she is easier to target.","

In its current state your better off damage boosting a teammate because chances are it does more damage than mercy’s pistol anyway","

"These are just my thoughts on a way that both scatter arrow and resurrect could be changed to be less frustrating to players.First off, scatter arrow. The change I would try is decreasing the initial damage done when the arrow splits (maybe still enough to kill a ""squishy"") and then increase the damage for every bounce, probably to more damage than it currently deals. I believe this would encourage it's use in corridors to hit multiple enemies gathered there, and it would stop tanks from getting one-shot. Damage fall-off may also be a good idea to try, as no one likes getting headshot from across the map by a stray arrow shard.As for resurrect, I heard this idea from someone on Facebook and expanded on it. The idea was that the ability would immediately respawn the target in the spawn room, so it's more of an emergency medical translocation. The cast time could be instant, and the cooldown could be dependent on how much time the target had until they would normally respawn.So what are your guys' ideas and thoughts?","

"I have heard a lot about Hanzo and how bad his pick rate is. I've been thinking of this for some time and many people say that he isn't a bad hero to pick if it wasn't for his survivability (or the lack there of). Aside for his wall climb, he has no way to get away from players that dive him. So I have an idea for a way to increase his survivability when getting dived. Give his sonic arrows a knockback effect on top of the existing recon ability that the arrow has. The knockback only works when it first impacts a wall, floor, or player. The only players that wouldn't be affected by this or those that have an obstacle that is blocking them from the arrow (wall, platform, shield). This would dramatically increase his pick rate simply because he now has a way to survive (or get away from) a dive. The area of effect of the knockback would be the same as that of the sonic arrow as it is now. As for the issue with the scatter arrow. It is a great ability and I don't think it should be gotten rid of, instead of that, I believe that it actually needs just a bit of a rework. It should have a 50% increase to its total damage but the trade off is its cool down, which should go from 10 seconds to between 25-30 seconds. This would keep the effectiveness of the ability but now, you need to be a lot more careful and selective on when and where you use it.","

Whenever I'm playing soldier, all my FPS instincts tell me to r-click to bring up my iron sights for aimed bursts.

Since that's possible, some games like Overwatch will avoid it for the sake of balance options like spread.","

"Iron sights add nothing of value as a game mechanic and only exist for ""realism"", which isn't really a selling point of this game.Forcing people to exchange mobility for accuracy just lowers the skill gap from what it otherwise would be if people could move fast while shooting accurately.  Beyond that, blocking most of the player's screen with an obnoxious weapon model is inferior to just having a simple and clean camera zoom that achieves the same results.","

"The community says otherwise. And our opinions have not changed at all. If there have been this many nerfs and you say it’s successful, is the “Balance triangle” just a figure that has not been closed, missing one line? Ressurect as an E ability, or for consoles, the left bumper (atleast for Xbox, I’m not sure for Ps4).Ressurect really only works as an ult, and now the community says to only give it during valkyrie. I highly agree with this, considering that the game director says “We arent reverting Mercy even though your feedback is exactly that”.  We lost an iconic voiceline, and we received a healbot.

"02/07/2018 07:52 PMPosted by NebulaWow. Well said. The devs really need to listen. This rework was a horrible failure but as long as Jeff ""feels"" like it was good, they don't care what we think.:\I'm sure it's more than just how he feels but these are the legitimate concerns that people who play and main her have. I mean even those that occasionally switch to Mercy find her more dull than she was before. I don't mind them not reverting her and I wasn't expecting them to but I don't feel like this rework was a success. The only thing they succeeded with was not making her OP or very hard to counter. Even the 30 second res isn't hard to deal with because it's so situational. I think she poses less threat than any other healer in the game at the moment; both ability and ultimate wise.So now how about the enjoyment, impactful feeling, and challenge of playing her? That's not something you can base stats or your own personal feelings on, that's something you have to base off how the community feels and I think we've already made it clear. Valkyrie gives us none of that.Note: I also changed the thread to add 2 important questions that have been pointed out to me.","

"02/07/2018 08:10 PMPosted by NeedlesIt's such a shame what has happened with her.  I hate that I don't want to play her anymoreFrom someone who's mained her from the moment I bought the game (she was one of the main reasons I did due to her unique play style) I've only played her 1-3 times since the last nerf. And I honestly regretted it every time. She feels like a chore to play that has no real impact when it matters most and at the end of the day the other supports just bring more to the table. She may have the best basic healing in the game but the others have better defense, can kill enemies while healing at the same time (therefor making your team not needing as much healing in the first place), and all have game changing/saving ultimates.What reason do I have to play Mercy now?","

People can agree with you, but that does not make your position the correct one.  If they feel mercy needs more changes, they will make more changes. Until then, either accept the changes, find a different hero to play, or stop playing the game. The devs have spoken on it and thats it for now. The issue is officially over at this point. Let it go. This is coming from a DVa main who was posted all sorts of crap during the Armor nerf and subsequent months. Youre not going to get any changes by continuously posting about it.","

Well the issue is despite what Genji mains want to tell you it is a low skill character.

I’d say less so. Nothing other than spread and the ult charge change affects him ( hack time for rein is mostly negligible). Spread means that he can be melted slightly faster- still would take awhile- and the emp charge change means less emp will be used.,"

"I mentioned this in another thread, but:02/09/2018 07:59 AMPosted by ResultReinhardt has trouble with flankers in general; as it stands, Sombra can drop his shield, but heroes like Genji and Tracer were already completely ignoring it. The only difference in these changes right now is that Sombra hacking Reinhardt will happen 0.15 seconds faster, and for Rein-- who can't shoot Sombra to stop her-- that's going to be barely noticeable. On the other hand, we'll see fewer Sombra EMPs, because she's not an EMP bot any more, so even if we're hacked, our teammates will still have their abilities.It'll balance out, but speaking as someone who plays a lot of Reinhardt, I'm not concerned by these changes. If anything, I like them.The only Sombra change that actually affects Rein is hack speed, again. And with Rein's big, slow, short-range hammer, 0.15 seconds of reaction isn't a huge difference compared to the less-consistent EMPs coming in.You know who this will effect more in the Tank category? The hitscan tank with infinite ammo who can actually peck Sombra out of her hack. The second most-picked hero in the game.","

This is going to powershift Sombra in a big way against basically everyone not just Reinhardt. I'm all for it it though as there are plenty of things that should have been countered by Sombra when you heard the design of her kit. If she becomes too oppressive they'll probably increase her spread by 5% or something,"

"@thread Not much. Hack speed is .15, and is interrupted by damage. Sneaking behind and hacking a Reinhardt guarding a choke is definitely value, but not reacting in the time it takes to hack with rotations from the enemy should have value. Also, rein is less ability reliant than some of the other tanks, and his barrier interrupts hack. Orisa is more hurt by the sombra chabge given how reliant she is on her abilities to perform her role, as well as hog and dva since they don't have as many barriers, but any tank that uses barriers can move it between them and sombra to interrupt hack, and any rotation or accidental damage will still interrupt.","

Now it’s going to be much harder To fend her off.You don't have much experience with the matchup, so I can't blame you for not knowing this, but the distance for Sombra's Hack is much greater than Reinhardt's hammer. There is no good reason for a Sombra to be in swinging distance of Reinhardt when she hacks him. Most people playing her find a good vantage point from behind, preferably up on a ledge, before they hack Rein.","

It's not hard to sneak behind a Rein, take away his shield, and make him regret playing Rein as Sombra. I've made plenty switch off and I myself have switched off Rein for that very reason.

One can hope anyway, but typically barriers from any tanks at gold and below seem to go unused. It boggles me that a team can’t push when a team is without a tank, but when one is present they don’t work with it anyway. I’m at a loss.","

"Face it, as soon as the enemy grabs the flag you have almost no chance to get it back unless you are already on the other side of the map.Capture the Bomb and place it in the enemy base would be much more balanced since you have to take it to the enemy spawn which gives them an advantage. Also make it so the bomb takes 10 seconds to destroy with 1 second to disarm. CTF maps can easily be redone for this gamemode.Capture the flag may be more of a staple of the genre but  Escort the bomb is more balanced for this game in particular.","

"After reading Geoff Goodman's post about Hanzo's rework, I had an idea for replacing Scatter Arrow that I think is pretty cool. I wanted to share it with everyone.So, Scatter Arrow's original intent was a way to pick off low health characters who had just turned a corner or gone into a room. Instead we all ended up shooting at the floor. With that in mind, I wanted to bring up a fire arrow.The idea I have is that the arrow would be on fire but when it hit the fire would explode like a molotov cocktail. It would be a somewhat lower damage, damage over time, ability.Specs:--Area of effect about 3-5 meters from impact--Duration would be about 2-3 seconds--Damage would be somewhere between 20 and 30 dps to any affected dargets--height would be maybe 1-2 meter above the ground or off the wall depending.--If it hits a shield, it would ignite the shield doing only minor damage to the shield but making it temporarily opaque reducing visibility.--A direct impact on a character could do higher DOT damage but maybe not have the AOE affect. Uses:--Could be an area denial tool. This could be used to stall points, force the enemy team to scatter if they are in a deathball, or temporarily block a choke.--Could be used to chase down a low health target that just entered a room and isn't in direct LOS any longer. --Could be used to displace an enemy sniper--Could be used to cause chaos by reducing visibility.Does anyone else think this could be an interesting way of providing Hanzo some utility?","

"I think fire arrow would work best as kinda of Molotov.The area you shoot will create a AOE damage fire pool that sets people on fire. This would stop players from holding up in one particular choke, Help keep bastion in check, help keep torb in check while still remaining defensive and precise. I think that something like that would need to be usable for hanzo where he stands to help better defend himself against tracer, Genji, sym and other flanktastic heros. He himself should receive no damage after standing in it.","

"I disagree. Blizzard has big coffers from the 3.5 million accounts sold and Overwatch is still selling reasonably well. They also have merchandise (which is actually kinda cool for some products) and so on. The game is not 'kept running' by lootboxes, lol.Loot boxes are a scam. They should sell game gold. It's more responsible. That or assure no duplicates for 50% of the boxes bought and at least one legendary. At the moment it is too random and a bit frustrating for those that want to buy boxes.Farming boxes is actually pretty easy, however. You can get 12 total from doing arcade in the 4 weeks of the event. If you play a lot then you'll get more. You can use coins to buy the cheapest voice lines and sprays and that means you have a better chance of getting the better content (that's how it worked for me last summer games at least).Here's some fun facts.From their annual report:Blizzard had 40 million MAUs (monthly active users) for the quarter. While down sequentially, this is the 6th quarter in a row with 40 million or more MAUs, primarily driven by Overwatch® and Hearthstone®. From their annual report:Blizzard delivered record segment revenues and operating income for a year with no major game release, as they continued to deliver continuous content across franchises including Overwatch, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft.You can read it all here. In the last few pages is a table that shows that Blizzard, Activision and King (Candy Crush) are making more money than God.http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ACTI/5984262494x0x970961/497CEF11-4FA6-415B-A4D5-59F1ECC4348D/Q4_2017_ATVI_Press_Release_Tables_vF.PDFOne last caveat:Revenues from in-game content reached nearly $1 billion in Q3 2016, led by World of Warcraft: Legion, Overwatch’s Summer Games content, and the One Night in Karazhan Adventure for Hearthstone which performed better than its predecessor.The number of in-game content purchasers in Call of Duty more than doubled year-to-date, and average revenue per customer also increased with Season Pass and a-la-carte map packs purchases.For the third quarter ending September 30, Activision-Blizzard net revenues came to $1.57 billion, up 58% compared to $990 million during Q3 2015.Right now it's at about $1.62 billion for Q3 2017. Yet, they have a pretty good debt profile in 2017. Not too much liabilities (surprisingly debt free for a monstrous company their size) and lots of cash in the bank. Cash flow was around 4,700,000,000, so they have a lot of money to throw around if needed.Sum: In 3 months the entire group made 1.62 billion in net revenue with lots of cash on hand and little to no debt for the year. They are chilling and riding the waves created by Overwatch and so on. Nothing much being developed or they'd have less money on hand. This is a company enjoying good times imo.","

Maybe they should put in a system like heroes of the storm and give us missions that can earn us gold.

Something along that lines to gives those that don't play the game several days a week a chance tok earn the skins.,"

"Today I played competitive for about 4-6 hours in my downtime, however I quickly noticed a trend that I found rather disturbing and want to discuss with others.For some background, I placed Mid Platinum but now am in Low Gold due to severe and seemingly endless loss streaks. I am a flex player who usually mains support but can play any character with moderate ability, however every game I have been placed in the past competitive season I have noticed two things that have not changed since it began.1. I am consistently placed with players who leave / drop games, or are verbally nasty and generally hostile. (Especially if they don't get to play what they want)2. I am constantly being forced into lower and lower ranks despite starting the season on a high note.My first thought was that I might have been reported a few times due to fighting back against the toxicity I face as a girl gamer, (worse: I have been reported due to being KIND and OPTIMISTIC, no this is not a joke, I was reported for being ""too kind, it's annoying and they should shut up."") but then this would be an issue with the reporting system since normally i only do call outs and otherwise remain pretty silent in voice chat.Or there is something else going on, an example to use: I played at least 6 games today where someone either on mine, or the enemy team left before the match started, there's a point where I can no longer just assume it's a poor internet connection when it's every other match it's happening. Second was the sheer amount of hostility I faced in each match we ended up losing, everyone I played with either was dead silent, verbally hostile, or just rage quitting mid match. Many people complain that Overwatch is toxic but there's something genuinely concerning about the fact nearly every game atleast ONE person is going out of their way to harass / troll / flame other people. My main concern however is how it seems that I can't rank anymore, these issues combined with pretty crushing losses, (that usually end up losses instead of draws because people just give up or throw at the end) I feel like no matter how I perform as a player I will not and can not get better or free myself from the position I'm in. If anyone has any advice on what I could do or have similar experiences I'd love to hear it because I can't be the only one who's dropping rank so much without explanation and being matched with severely horrible games.","
						Feb 9
					",,,,,,,
"OP, I agree with you completely. It is virtually impossible to rank up anymore.The problem with ranked is that it bases your ""personal"" SR on factors that are beyond your control.Leavers, throwers, trolls, one tricks, smurfs...Git gud and carry they say. That is rubbish. Pop off and carry a game and the next game you have a leaver or a troll on your team and all your hard work in the previous game is undone. Its like a rollercoaster ride of randomness. More luck than skill. SR should be changed to LR, luck rating, because that is exactly what it is XDThe only way to fix competitive is to make SR gains/loses performance based. If I outperform my opposite number but lose because my team were a bunch of slackers I shouldn't lose SR.Unfortunately Blizzard think that the system is working fine and they will never change it.In the end, rank really doesn't matter. Two years from now you won't care what your rank in season 8 was, so why do you care now?","

"I had the same issue at the start of the season, I wanted to flex to make sure everyone in my team could play what they are best at and communicate as much as possible to have some kind of team cohesion... Long story short, that was a huge mistake. Leave voice chat, mute group chat, take the hero that you think you'll have the biggest impact on depending on the map and rely on your team not being dead weight who can position themselves decently and not feed. Being verbally abused will always result in a mental strain that will have an impact on your performance, the way people take it vary but better be safe than sorry. Playing what you'll have an impact on means that you'll be a lot more in control of the outcome. And to make sure we are on the same page, that doesn't necessarily means playing dps. I personally tend to be more impactful on tanks or support because I know what a dps needs and want to be enabled and my positioning being quite decent I tend to be a pain to kill for a flanker making it easier for my team to do various things as opposed to someone with low experience in the role. Also I feel like no matter how I perform as a player I will not and can not get better or free myself from the position I'm in.It's overwatch, you will feel that way very often in this game due to how the matchmaking works. It can often feel like a huge lottery. Just stay positive about yourself and practice as much as you can.","

"As a player who was in a similar situation, I wanna tell you that not all hope is lost.I started Season 4 in high gold. I had been Plat for the last 2 seasons and felt that I didn't deserve that standing. So I set my bar higher and aim to climb to Diamond.I began playing solo queue. Flex; mostly tanks, but filling in with some Pharah and Mercy every now and then. I climbed to Plat and stopped half-way there. Suddenly, I began to lose every game until I dropped down to mid-gold. I was destroyed. My morale was at an all-time low. Still, I didn't give up. I queue'd up with a friend who was 100 SR higher than me and together she helped me climb off my bad streak. I began playing more Pharah since she could Mercy, and more Reinhardt since she was an awesome Ana. I carried on as solo queue.I finished climbing back to Plat and felt stuck at low-Plat once again.At this point I asked my friend if she could help me again (she had been playing with a Zen and Winston main for some time and had climbed to almost Diamond) and she added me to the group. At this point I began playing Reinhardt all the time. He quickly became my main (at the time, it was Pharah) and began climbing. With teammates I trusted and learned to communicate well with, we all began to climb. My friend finally got to Diamond and I was almost there.At this point I had some IRL issues I had to deal with, so I missed some games with them. What happened? They lost quite a lot of them. I knew I wasn't carrying them, but it certainly gave a boost to my morale I had not expected. I felt good about myself, as if I was important to this team effort.When I came back, we added 2 more randoms to the group that we met while playing and got back to it. We played a Rein, Winston, Soldier (my friend), Reaper (flex), Zen and Ana. And we dominated. Since they had lost a couple of games and I hadn't been there for those, I managed to keep my winning streak. And while playing with them, we didn't lose A SINGLE game. I went on the largest winning streak of my 700 levels in Overwatch, 16 games won in a row. I gained amazing game awareness. I communicated what I saw from the front line (low hp players running off, players flanking, players looking to engage) and I acted upon it. I learned the importance of not charging of and being the team's shield. I sniped Pharahs with my firestrike. And I shattered entire teams (no kidding). I got the most value out of a Reinhardt I could manage.In the end, I shot past the Diamond goal I had, and made it all the way to Master, with a career high of 3597. At which point I couldn't team up with my friends because of SR differences.I played some more but since the season was nearing the end and I had some internet issues and trolls crossing my path, I decided to leave it off where I had gotten.I leave you here the link to the Google Spreadsheet where I kept all of my progress (except for a jump you will see where I forgot to write it down).https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17qTrB1MmvTNOg8BM4HhuiTmYsR9z-ynHr1t62Gz_R2Y/edit?usp=sharingBottom line is, don't give up. If you feel stuck or demoralized, queue up with a friend. If no one's online, try to make friends in your games. Overwatch can get to your head, don't let it.Flexing too much takes experience away from you. Don't one-trick, but definately decide on a main and learn how to handle every situation with that main (try youtuber KarQ on his 1 tip against every hero as a <insert your hero here>).And in the end, practice. Climbing the ladder is just around the corner.P.S.: also, if you have the time, check out youtubers Skyline (for his old educational videos and aiming training) and Animetic (for her ""thoughts of a Mercy"" series)","

"Group up with friends (3 stack works well for me usually) and try to create synergy.Make sure you and your friends work on good team morale right from the start ideally in team voice. Make sure you mitigate hostile behavior without actually attacking the one being hostile. A light joke or a friendly reminder that being angry won't help anyone win can do wonders.Remember, we're all just people who want to have fun with that game. Sometimes one has a losing streak or has been irritated by others in previous matches. Try to appeal to their rationality in a friendly manner. Don't threaten with reports or anything, because that will just make them angrier.Also, even though I already said it... try to create synergy with your teammates!!! Like playing hog + orisa and using halt + hook combo. If you have a one-trick, never ever get salty and try to get him/her to switch. They most likely wont. Try your best to create synergy with them, and get them into team voice for better communication.Anyone who says ranking up isn't possible because of throwers/leaver etc. hasn't tried hard enough. Your opponents have the same issue. Use your mind to transform bad team morale into good one, and you'll have a massive advantage.","

"I literally haven’t won a round since I finished my placement matches.  I’ve been playing quikplay because of it.It feels like, when you win, you’ll win very easily, and when the games had enough of you winning, it will deliberately match you with bad teams, and you’ll Be the ones getting steamrolled.","

"my answer to this after decades of playing ranked competitive games.Just stop playing ranked.It isn't worth the stress or the toxicity, no matter what rank you are, you will always be seen as a piece of garbage, because youre playing a competitive game that promotes toxicity. Your bragging rights mean nothing.Just enjoy the game for what it is, play normals and leave the stress out of it.This applies to basically every competitive game.","

"I think this type of game just doesn't work well with the type of people who play video games these days, everyone is just hostile to others just because it's over the internet and the other people can not do anything about it other than report and count your lucky stars Blizzard will do something about it.I face the same problems that's why i don't play competitive no more and this shouldn't be the case, i shouldn't be forced off a game-mode because of how poor it is, instead i resume on QuickPlay and Arcade (for the lootboxes) i still face the same problems but as it's QuickPlay it doesn't affect me as much. I'm confident Blizzard see this issue with the game and i'm sure they have gone over it but i personally think it will never change.The only way to somewhat enjoy Overwatch is to play in a 6 stack but the issue with this is being placed against other 6 stacks these are usually very very toxic more than the average player, so in theory there is no way to enjoy this game other than just playing passively and not caring if you win or lose, but this also causes a problem, if you don't care if you win then why play the game, it won't be enjoyable, i think this is why a lot of people fall down to toxicity and end up being toxic themselves, it's the whole ""Can't beat them, Join them"" scenario.Personally i can't think of anyway to enjoy the game, you just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best when searching for a game, So what i'm trying to say is it's the community that is spoiling the game and Blizzard only can do so much about it. People just need to learn how to be friendly to people, but we all know that will never happen.","

Well the video game industry has fed the masses this lie that you can become a pro gamer and most people are delusional. Like half the people in competitive think that their teammates are holding them back from being rich and famous. It would be hilarious if it didn't ruin gaming.I remember doing 40 man PUG raids in WoW and that came with a lot of failure. Literally spending hours trying to kill a few bosses. Half the team didn't have a meltdown the second something went wrong. We reviewed what went wrong and what we need to do the next try afterwards for like 15 minutes and tried to work together to accomplish our goal again. You almost never had ideal team composition doing it this way and no one went crazy because of that either.I remember playing counterstrike for hours on end and no one ever throwing a tantrum because a push failed. Gaming was always about the process/experience and esports has corrupted that. Winning was seen as an achievement not a right.,"

"02/08/2018 11:56 PMPosted by ShelusineI had the same issue at the start of the season, I wanted to flex to make sure everyone in my team could play what they are best at and communicate as much as possible to have some kind of team cohesion... Long story short, that was a huge mistake. Leave voice chat, mute group chat, take the hero that you think you'll have the biggest impact on depending on the map and rely on your team not being dead weight who can position themselves decently and not feed. Being verbally abused will always result in a mental strain that will have an impact on your performance, the way people take it vary but better be safe than sorry. Playing what you'll have an impact on means that you'll be a lot more in control of the outcome. And to make sure we are on the same page, that doesn't necessarily means playing dps. I personally tend to be more impactful on tanks or support because I know what a dps needs and want to be enabled and my positioning being quite decent I tend to be a pain to kill for a flanker making it easier for my team to do various things as opposed to someone with low experience in the role. Also I feel like no matter how I perform as a player I will not and can not get better or free myself from the position I'm in.It's overwatch, you will feel that way very often in this game due to how the matchmaking works. It can often feel like a huge lottery. Just stay positive about yourself and practice as much as you can.kind and honest advice! appreciated","

"Sombra has been weird. She isn't really a DPS, she doesn't have the output for it, and her hack isn't reliable enough (very easy to shut down before it goes through) in order to be very useful in teamfights. She has been filling the role, then, of an off-support for a while now. Hacking a healthpack has been the reasonable thing to do for a while now, as she cant always get a hack off against a team that has good reactions and game sense. This is mostly because when she hacks, there is a loud noise and a bunch of lines pointing to her position. This makes it easy to damage her, making the hack stop. Ergo, you hack the healthpack, have your team charge EMP, then initiate off of that, if you have a team that will. The problem is that this made her kit essentially just lurking around hacking healthpacks and then using EMP, with this really awkward period while you try to be at least a little helpful. The hack changes makes it so not hacking healthpacks and instead hacking an enemy Genji, Reinhardt, or Orisa (if her shield is down, at least) is much more reliable and viable. Also, it brings her ult carge more in line with other heroes. She could get an EMP every fight if the ally Roadhog decided to use her healthpacks instead of his E, which again made it feel like EMP was her purpose. She will be getting charge faster through primary fire now, though, since more shots will be landing. I feel like these changes will help her feel more like her cinematic and make her be picked instead of an off-DPS like Junkrat or Pharah, but she wont be taking the place of main-DPS like Mcree or Soldier anytime soon. And that's ok. Its still better than replacing a Zen with her.","

"Face it, as soon as the enemy grabs the flag you have almost no chance to get it back unless you are already on the other side of the map.Capture the Bomb and place it in the enemy base would be much more balanced since you have to take it to the enemy spawn which gives them an advantage. Also make it so the bomb takes 10 seconds to destroy with 1 second to disarm. CTF maps can easily be redone for this gamemode.Capture the flag may be more of a staple of the genre but  Escort the bomb is more balanced for this game in particular.","

"Hey guys, so I've been hearing a lot of talk on the forums recently. Apparently a lot of people seem to think Mercy's Ult is overpowered. People seem to not like it when they get a 5 man kill and Mercy comes in and undo's all that hard work. This is why I'm offering a guide to counter her ult so the complaints don't reach Blizz and she doesn't get reworked into a monster and then gradually nerfed down into a non factor over time. Ya know, some silly nonsense like putting her Rez on a cooldown lol. So here's five ways to counter Resurrect.1. Save an ult - Don't go balls out in your ultimates and use all six of them lol. Save that Earthshatter, or graviton or D.Va bomb or even something like a Mei ult and once those guys are rez'd pop your saved ult. You may not get all five again but even taking two or three back to the grave basically wins you the team fight and Mercy's ult is wasted.2. Kill the Mercy - If the enemy team has a Mercy, NEVER use any big ults without sending a flanker to hunt her down first. I always told my team that before you do anything let's find that Mercy, even if it takes a few extra seconds.3. Coordination - Say you went balls out and couldn't kill the Mercy. Don't panic and start complaining, acknowledge the Rez and stay together and continue the team fight. A reason why Mercy isn't seen at the pro scene is because teams know to follow steps 1 and 2, and if those fail they excel at step three. I legit saw a Mercy get a huge rez in a pro match and the other team literally just sat there until they weren't invincible anymore and wiped them again.So yeah, these are my three tips. Remember you wiping a team and Mercy bringing them back are both done with little effort and one button, Q. If you guys can have it easy, why can't she? /s","

"I understand some people don't like this change, but please stop comparing it to Roadhog, Mei, and other Supports getting charge from healing, because for Sombra it's a whole different ball game.Sombra's packs are hacked for a fair amount of time, and respawn faster for her team, and as we all know, this typically meant Sombra would have Ult first in the field in most situations if her team farmed them.For Roadhog and Mei, they have to use their abilities that give them a bit more staying power, meaning that they won't get the benefits from them or that big burst of Ult charge until those abilities are off CD againAs for the Healers...Moira is on a resource and CD restriction. Ana, Mercy, and Zen have to choose who to heal, unless Ana has Grenade, or Zen/Mercy have Ult, and Lucio can't heal very fast AT ALL.However, Sombra just has to Hack a health pack, and until the hack expires, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is almost close to a minute long, she's racking up ult charge, and typically will have it before the Supports even.

Sombra charges EMP too quickly from the packs anyway. They are looking into buffing the charge in other ways anyway. With a reduction in hack time it would essentially be the same.

However, it ultimately it came down to draw after draw from torb and sym defense comps making it impossible to really play the game without real effort in coordination or lucky escapes. It took real coordination in order to get a flag and honestly that was the hardest part. Most of the time getting it back to base was a breeze. So essentially the game came down to who could pick up a flag and get it around the corner. Then, comes the 2nd flaw in CTF: movement abilities making it impossible to catch opponents after they escape with the flag.So I see what you guys have done to address those issues: 1.) Make the flag instant pickup in order to focus on team strategy in moving the flag back to base rather than focus on the fight to pick it up in the first place. 2.) Remove movement increasing abilities to give players the chance to intercept the flag. Reasonable attempts on a solution....if it wasn't for one thing: Lucio.Lucio breaks this idea completely and creates a meta far more toxic and unbeatable than torb/mercy in og CTF. Game after game I just see Lucio/Dva/Zarya combos that matrix/bubble Lucio while he sweeps in and snatches the flag making it absolutely impossible to stop him, then watch any half decent Lucio wallride over the horizon at the top of maps with no chance of stopping. That's all it has been.This game isn't designed for CTF let alone CTF focusing its balance on interception. It's too fast paced. The issue of interception hasn't been solved and now instant flag pickups have created an unstoppable meta that I guarantee will flood into the scene soon (its only been the first day). And to create a competitive mode at this stage on such a broken system isn't the best idea. I get it, it's arcade, but competitive CTF could have some potentional.The mode needs to be slowed down more, not sped up. Bring back flag pickup times to counter these in-and-out strats. Bring back a 3-5 second pickup time, but don't have damage cancel the channel [Edit: Match pickup time with return time]. This forces the team to coordinate defense while earning a capture by holding the position. This also forces the defending team to earn flag defense by killing the attackers and not just poking them with turrets and such. Keep the movement speed restrictions in order to keep things slow to encourage interception and teamwork.I think this is a good middle-ground solution for a balance. Opinions welcome.","

"I actually like this version much better than how it was originally. Before it was very frustrating to play against any decent Sym/Torb combo especially if you threw in a Bastion or Orisa in the mix. Even now, I've seen Sym/Torb do well despite the instant flag pick up. ...unless there's a Lucio on the team.I think the real issue isn't with the fast paced instant flag pick up, but with the fact that Lucio's movement abilities were almost all allowed. He can heal himself, he can wallride (which makes him faster and harder to hit), and if he's with a teammate he can still amp it up and his teammate won't drop the flag while still allowing them to gain the speed boost.I think if they changed Lucio so that he can't switch between healing/speed, make his amp it up drop the flag for his teammates, and possibly (assuming it's still too much) take wall riding out of it, it would improve the mode significantly.","

"Bullseye! Alot of people still haven't realised how strong Lucio is on this game mode, arguably the strongest hero for CTF.","

I hope I reach Masters in Season 9. I'm still a Diamond but only solo que. I think I need a partner to reach Masters to be honest. Season 9 I plan to main Sombra/Moira/Symmetra as my top three. This current season I only mained Moira but I think I need to flex much more if I want to reach higher levels of gameplay.,"

"When hacking a target that dies within the last 0.1s of its cast time, you are forced on cooldown even if your target dies.For instance in this clip: https://streamable.com/uwa6gMy hack did not complete, I did not get an assist for the kill, yet I went on cooldown. A similar thing happens frequently if you hack a Zenyatta JUST as he uses transcendence or a Sombra JUST as she translocates across the map. You go on cooldown despite getting no way to capitalise on your hack, as your target gets to use their abilities which should have cancelled the casting.","

"Explosive Arrow- The explosive has 125 damage if stuck on the enemy's body.- The arrow itself has 125 damage.- The explosive has AOE damage even if not stuck directly. This will allow Hanzo to be able to one shot the enemy, if the enemy does not get immediate peeling from his support.The explosive blows up after ~2 sec.This is way better than the scatter, since the enemy actually can be saved by support or zarya shield etc. For hanzo too, since it will do consistent damage with AOE damage.","

"The whole problem with SCATTER is that it can one shot enemies without needing a headshot. Hanzo is designed to take lots of skill, so being able to one shot someone with a body shot isnt exactly great.This would also be OP in low ranks with low communication, but be near useless in higher ranks where you can ask for a heal and get it instantly","

And unlike doomfist punch, the scatter can literally kill someone from nowhere without time for teammates to save him.What I wanted to say was that as people learn about the new hanzo, the healer and tanks will have to play better to counter hanzo. When doomfist came out for the first time, t500 supports and tanks were slow af to react against doomfist punch. However, as they learned the reaction time got better drastically.","

But I dont see how this would be balanced. Your doomed to death in lower ranks, and the only rank where this isnt an instakill is the 1% in GM and top 500 where theres support players with ungodly reaction times like ryujehong.","
