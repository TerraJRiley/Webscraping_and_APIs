A husband's marital satisfaction is a function of his wife's attractiveness. A wife's marital satisfaction is not related to her husband's attractiveness.

Ugly women don't get hired. Callbacks are 54&amp;#37; for attractive women, 47&amp;#37; for attractive men, 26&amp;#37; for ugly men and 7&amp;#37; for ugly women. The average was 32&amp;#37; for men and 28&amp;#37; for women. Being an ugly man is about as bad as being an average woman.

"BRUTAL, this just happened yesterday: My Stacy friend just told me that she friendzoned some guy","Yesterday I was at my friend's house who is a Stacy, and she just randomly dropped a pinkpill when we were talking. She told me ""I just friendzoned some guy yesterday"", in which I replied ""huh, why and how do you feel about that?"" She then basically laughed it off and told me that she only sees that guy as a friend (she has a boyfriend btw). I then felt the NEED to ask her how many guys she has friendzoned in her lifetime. She laughed and said ""MANY! This isnt the first one"" 

&amp;#x200B;

You know how I felt? She has PLENTY of ""orbiters"" (as incels like to call guys who basically worship a female) and when we went outside a cashier complimented her nails and then she saw my nails and we both laughed but inside I was so hurt because not even my nails look good, as much as I try to make them look nicely. When we walked through the city 3 guys from school approached her and they talked about some stuff (IDK because I started walking away from them because I didnt want them to acknowledge my existence). All of the guys were so happy and you could literally see their eyes shining for her.

Make a fake OKCupid or Tinder profile with a Stacy. Fill it out with details about your real personality. Watch the moids spill their hearts and dedicate their lives to you.,"That‚Äôs a black pill if you ever need one. 

The same men who would treat you cruelly, laugh behind your back, mock you to your face, abuse you, etc would worship you if you looked differently. 

Go ahead. Do it. Maybe then you‚Äôll begin to understand why I don‚Äôt take men seriously. ",Trufemcels
Any flat chested gals here?,"I‚Äôve been mocked my entire life for my small breasts by my family, friends, and even strangers. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I don‚Äôt even check my bra size anymore, because I‚Äôm afraid of what it might be.",Trufemcels
I used to be a (black) femcel. Now I‚Äôm a mega Stacy. Here‚Äôs how you turn things around.,"The reality is that as women the way our face looks matters much less than our bodies. Use makeup if you have bad skin. 99% of the time you do NOT need plastic surgery. If you do then save up for it and get it, but I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs probably not needed. 

I am 34 years old, black, and I have a rotation of wealthy Chads at my beck and call, not to mention all the orbiters. I can marry and have kids if I want, but I don‚Äôt and never have. 

Seriously consider what marriage and kids means for your life. You have to wake up to the same man literally every day... Not every day for a few weeks, or a few months, or a couple of years, but for life. Realistically you will get tired of him. I have never wanted children. If you do then there‚Äôs no reason you can‚Äôt have them, although you should aim to have your first before 40. 

Anyway, up until my early 30s I was a complete femcel. 100 pounds overweight (in my mid 20s I was skinny, but had no confidence. Weight creeped on over the years). Never had a boyfriend, never had a man love or adore me, only had a couple of guys who used and abused me before leaving. When I was 31 I became tired of feeling sorry for myself and decided to change. 

I changed my diet overnight. I ate less food in general and no junk at all. Exercised every day. Only put good things into my body. 

I blocked out the negativity from society and men. Men are jealous of women so they do everything they can to keep us down, but ultimately we have all the power. You have to block them out. You have to understand that as women we are superior to men. They exist to serve us and when we act as if we are inferior to them they get angry and punish us with abuse. This is why ‚Äúnice girls finish last‚Äù and men love bitches. It‚Äôs the natural order. 

Anyway for a year I focused on nothing but losing weight/fitness, improving myself, and my career. 

It all paid off. 

Age is a distraction. The wall isn‚Äôt for women, it‚Äôs for men. Men hate this which is why they project it onto us. The truth is that as women WE have the ability to age like wine and get better with age, especially black women. 

Now I‚Äôm 34 and commonly mistaken for 23. I make $320k a year on average with the business I founded five years ago when I was alone and unwanted. I have two rich, tall, ripped, Chad boyfriends who constantly fly me out and take me on vacations. They have committed to me, but I am not committed to them exclusively and they know about each other. They are fine with this as they genuinely enjoy my company. They both keep me sexually and romantically satisfied, yet sometimes I‚Äôll go out with friends (losing weight caused me to make female friends as well) and I get hit on by men all the time. 

I‚Äôm having the time of my life and you can too. Just improve yourself day by day and remind yourself that you are inherently divine and that you are superior to all men and that you will show everyone.

Remember, you are much more than a prize. You are the God he could never afford or deserve. Any man should be honored to be in your presence. 
 Love you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",Trufemcels
SuiFuel incident at my gym the other day,"I've been a long time lurker of this forum and finally decided to share some of my experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was a kid I've been into combat sports. It's always been my cope. Because of it I ended up getting a muscular toned body and not to mention I lost my breasts from all the workouts I do and the scars I've gotten from my tournaments. And all hope was lost for when I ended  up growing 5'11 tall, making me undateable to most men.

&amp;#x200B;

To me my boxing and kick boxing gyms have been sanctuaries because average women let alone Stacies barely attended them. the men at these gyms never showed any interest in me and I thought it was because we used to train all the time together but I did know that I didn't have anything to offer that they would be attracted either.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's what happened. Last week a male student introduced one of his  female friends to the gym and this girl was an absolute Stacy. Perfectly 5'6 tall, glowing skin without any imperfections, big blue eyes and silky hair, but dumb and uninteresting and boring as a sack of potatoes. She also had nice round big breasts and a perfect butt.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been one of the best students at my gyms with perfect technique but I've always gotten heavily criticized regardless. Specially after my sparring sessions (sparring is when you fight with less power to practice techniques). And they were absolutely brutal to me during my first few days. No one was really helping me when I was a beginner and guess what.. as soon as Stacy shows up everyone at the gym is so nice to her, teaching her how to perfect her techniques, showering her with praise and encouraging her even when she's doing a terrible job. They finally make her spar with another guy who goes very light on her and Stacy does a terrible job. And guess what they all acted as she was a great prospect.

&amp;#x200B;

After the training session was over everyone walked up to her and chatted her up, which never happened to me on my first day. Now the only place I go to cope is infested with Stacy too. There's no escape.

How to spot an incel?,"What are some giveaways that a guy is an incel, either by interacting or just looking at him?

I‚Äôve noticed short petite or short gym-obsessed (shortcels) and &lt;4/10 moids are more prone to inceldom. The most important thing is they will generally try to looksmaxxx in ways normal guys don‚Äôt, such as trying to dress like Chad (but failing), and going to the gym (but also failing). If he‚Äôs ugly but still hits the gym everyday he‚Äôs almost definitely an incel.

A short or &lt;4/10 man who isn‚Äôt an incel usually doesn‚Äôt bother to looksmaxxx and are safe to be around.

I turn 35 this month...,"...and I've never felt so alone. I don't really talk to my family, and thanks to my mental issues, I really don't have any friends. I actually looked in the mirror this morning. Usually I don't, because I have no reason to. I don't wear makeup because it's like putting paint on a trash can and trying to pretend it's a crystal vase. 

Anyway, I must have been feeling extra masochistic this morning, because I looked at myself. I really wish I hadn't. I've spent the whole day on the edge of tears. I have gray hair. Not all of it, or even a lot of it, but enough that I can see it. I have *gray hair* and I'm *still alone*. If I couldn't get a girl when I was young, there's no way in hell I'll get one now. Lesbians ignore ugly women too, and now that I'm visibly aging I'm worth even less than I was. I didn't think that was possible. 

I hate meeting people, and seeing the disgust that strangers hide behind their polite smiles. Going out in public makes it clear that I'm invisible. I wouldn't even know how to approach a girl. 

The only 'relationship' I had was with a meth addict who sponged off of me, stole from me, beat me, and molested me in my sleep. I was so desperate to be with someone, anyone, that I let him use me and abuse me, even though I prefer women. We only had sex like 3 times, and even then he insisted that it be from behind so he didn't have to look at me (yes, he said that). So I decided that if I was gonna get ignored, I would at least get ignored by the right gender.  

Of course, I'm so ugly that even other lesbians aren't interested, even though they are generally more accepting of ugly women than men. If even another woman can't see past my face and body, then it really is over.

I keep going about my life, sleep alone at night, and despise myself every second of every day. It's getting harder and harder to see the point, though.",Trufemcels

30=OLD,"why is it when a a female hits 30 she is immediately considered old?Ive seen people call 30 year old women ''middle age'',ive seen them get called hags and ''too old',and they would view them as these ''so old wrinkly all fat'' basically the same as a woman who is 60......

Middle age is actually considered to be after +40.    (so i dont understand why people call 30 year old women middle age..but ok)

&gt;The US Census lists the category middle age from 45 to 65.

‚Äã

Ive come to terms with the obsession of womens age (must be younger and i quote ''fresh'' ),but 30 isnt even old infact its not even middle age,ive meet 30 year old women who look 18 (and this is coming from someone who is younger than 25) so i dont understand this obsession with  25-30=OLD

It‚Äôs so unfair,"I have to work 6 times as hard just to be considered as an option (probably their last option).

For example, I always have well manicured feet.

But the shape of her toe was still genetically nicer than mine. Anyway, no guy gave a damn.

We often see how incels claim girls being are raised like princesses. And I have a theory why they think it's like that.,"&amp;#x200B;

You see, **men only see white, western and beautiful Stacies as women**, other women don't count. So when a confused incel says ""women are raised like princesses"" what he wants to say is ""white, western european and american Stacies  (a.k.a. only women I notice) are raised as princesses"". An Indian girl from some Indian village might be aborted or she might be raped and killed because she's a girl, but she's not a white Stacy, so her life doesn't matter. A Pakistani girl being married off to her cousin at 16 isn't a princess, princesses are white, as incels well know. A Chinese girl might be hated by her parents for not being a boy, she might be scorned and rejected since the day one, but she's not a white Stacy, so her life doesn't matter. A Russian or a Latian girl might not be beaten or raped or killed, but she will more often than not be raised in a family that favours boys over girls, her parents might invest less money into her education, if she gets raped, people will blame it on her clothes, etc, etc.

Even a Stacy in a conservative western family can be treated like shit. Her father will force her to do ""womanly chores"", she might not inherit the same money as her brothers, She might be fucked over for tuition, her brothers may have access to more expensive schools, cars and such. 

**So, when a confused incel says ""girls are being raised by princesses"", intepret that as ""3% of female population is being raised equally, and 1% is being raised better than men, while the 94% or the rest of them may as well die"".**",Trufemcels
Male lurcher not shopping for anything - Hi!,"Just saying I sympathize and empathize with a lot here, and personally I find this sub a good dose of perspective and shedding light on how ""the other half lives"", to state it simplistically and stupidly.

Just thank you for sharing your experiences.

Sincerely,
one who once thought himself ""incel"" but is not even sure about any of the assumptions behind that word, never mind all the psychotic hate --- there are many layers of bullshit to sort through in this culture... I am becoming a dilettante archaeologist.

P.S. - Okay yes I have to admit I get excites at the slightest bit of female attention in my life, because I am pathetic for my own life and/or genetic reasons, and that must be some part of my motivation posting here (who can tell?), but I genuinely appreciate this place and don't want anything.

P.P.S. -- I'm not really a white knight fishing for female humans.  I'm simply trying to connect with people in real ways and understand things that have plagued and vexed me all of my life.  I'm trying to reconcile all the shits I experienced, and find explanations that ring humanly true rather than the ones that confirm my whiny selfish biases in hot pockets of the world wide internet.

P.P.P.S. -- I am also sort of trying to amuse myself and anyone else who may have a similar sense of humor.  I'm sorry, I can't shed myself of all ulterior layers of my own, because I'm human and I know they are there... the ones I am conscious of, the ones I try to deny, and the ones deep enough I can't even see yet.

P4S -- The best thing to do with me would be to completely ignore this post and/or downvote it into oblivion, or have a mod delete it.  :)  Take the positive energies and feelings for their own sakes and not as opening gambits for transactional greedy human transactions, but then carry on as you will and should and must and are wont to do.  You don't need me telling you what to do.  You also don't need me telling you you don't need me telling you what to do.  You also don't need me telling you you don't need me telling you you don't need me telling you what to do, and so on.

P5S -- I just want to be good and decent and treat people right no matter their genders and situations and sexualities-or-nots.  I look to learn and hope to just think of people different from me who go through tough life things, and if I can, treat them goodly like they deserve within my sphere.  I'd like to not be an unthinking animal using too many words to justify his animal choices, and I also realize it's too late because I already typed too much.

Reddit has destroyed men for me,"Reddit has destroyed men for me. I am in my 20‚Äôs and a working professional. I never dated, have been asked out, or anything in my life. 

For years I dreamt of love and marriage but now I am understanding that love and marriage is only meant for the top 20% of women. 

Reddit has taught me:

That men are exceptionally picky about looks. Men hate their looksmatch. Men don‚Äôt want a nice 5/10 girl. They reluctantly date and mess with 6-7/10 girls. They only really are attracted to women who are 8+ out of 10. And they make it very clear that this is how they feel online on their posts and comments. 

Men consider any woman over age 25-28/30 to be disgusting and post wall. Even if they are over 30. A 34 year old 6/10 woman wants a date with a 42 year old 5/10 man? Good luck with that!!!! 

Men are picky about women‚Äôs careers. Basically a woman needs to pull $50-80k but not Work more than 8-5 so that she can do all the housework. 

Men refuse to combine finances to do important things like buy a house or raise a child. Stay at home moms are considered deadbeat losers.

Guide to Looksmaxxing (for Females): Section 3: Hair,"I will be busy moving next week so the next part may be released late. 

As a forward to this post I would like to once again stress the importance of health above trends for your own well being. The styling and colouring theories below are basic and meant to teach you the reasoning behind the aesthetic choice.

Please critique/add points in the comments.

# Hair Health

**Food**

Nutrients you should focus on for hair growth are proteins, B vitamins, Omega 3 Fatty acids and iron. 

Examples of foods to incorporate into diet can be found [here](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/ss/slideshow-foods-healthy-hair).

&amp;#x200B;

**Blood Circulation**

Pushing blood to the hair roots requires a strong heart. Here are ways to improve circulation at the top of your head (Cardio is an obvious one!):

1. Massaging your hair with Oil (Try Caster Oil, Almond Oil or Coconut oil as base, add tea tree oil to combat smells caused by fungus or bacteria)
   1. Take a bowl of about 50 ml (depending on hair length) and dip the tips of your fingers into the oil (I suggest you cut and file your nails beforehand) massage your scalp using gentle circular motions. (be careful about getting oil near face as this could cause pimples)
   2. Only a few inches of hair close to the scalp should be coated in oil (more will make your head very heavy)
   3. Braid your hair or tie it to prevent tangles. Leave the oil in for 8-12 hours and wash using shampoo and conditioner.
   4. Repeat this 1-2x per week

2.  Inversion yoga: basically holding any position where your head lies substantially lower then your heart. Examples include: [wall assisted head/hand stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bkX3kx0eNk), [downward dog](https://passionateyogi.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dscn1923-2.jpg) or [bridge pose](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/g4kYdtlcURi6LR25SsH3cg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://l.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/original/6t3icGQCZx0Q-6b_qic_2-LyV6A). Get into these positions 5-10 times, progressively hold each position for longer each time (this prevents uncomfortable pressure on the head or dizziness)

If you don't have time or are feeling lazy, don't worry! You can also just [hang](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/model-lies-with-her-head-dangling-over-the-side-of-a-bed-to-show-off-picture-id3200752) off the side of a stable bed or chair.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Gingko Biloba supplements like these ones increase blood circulation

&amp;#x200B;

4. Cold Showers: Progressively make your morning showers colder (this helps wake you up and forces your body to increase circulation)

&amp;#x200B;

5. Brush hair regularly (at least twice a day). This gets rid of tangles and helps circulation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things to Avoid**

\- Scrubbing ends too much while washing hair

\- Combing/brushing wet hair

\- Heat (where possible)

\- Not sleeping properly

\- Being stressed 

\- Over washing your hair (washing strips oil from the scalp)

&amp;#x200B;

**Regularly**

\- Trim your ends 

\- Get rid of tangles

\- Tie hair to prevent tangles

\- Use a silk pillow case (wash frequently)

\- Use hair masques like egg, avocado or curd (Once a week)

# Hair Styling

According to [this study](https://www.urj.ucf.edu/vol6issue2/sewell/literature-review.php) the most attractive hair is: 

1. Long to medium length (remember this may not suit you depending on your body type) 
2. Straight or wavy with high volume 

This may require a genetic lottery to have naturally but can be achieved via styling techniques.

I do not personally recommend heat treatments as they damage hair in the long run and thus are not sustainable methods.

First see this guide to [hair types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-akyyxey8w4&amp;t=263s) and this guide to [porosity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaAd8syyaOE). 

*If you have curly hair:*

Note that these techniques damage your hair. It is extremely important you follow the above steps to achieve healthy hair. You may also want to consider hair products with biotin, amino acids or proteins and keratin. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQK_jutehKg) are further salon tips to maintaining your hair's structural integrity.

This is a [guide to product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAN7KE6RvGI)s for curly hair

 There are permanent or long lasting straightening procedures that can be done please research them if they suit you.

This is a guide to [creating waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCK9yqzd0sQ) (note that you want to straighten hair before curling to keep curls neat.

Remember to use hairspray after doing any heat treatments to make them last.

3. Guide to [choosing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcLGV6P8_9Q) and [inserting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m6FTCvmrKs) hair extensions.

&amp;#x200B;

Other methods of styling by curling, crimping etc. don't effect your SMV and thus are up to your discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

# Hair Colour

According to [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201509/which-hair-color-induces-the-strongest-physical-attraction), having blonde or brown hair does increase your attractiveness to males however note that the following are very damaging procedures for your hair. Coloring is simply a method of drawing attention by highlighting natural features like makeup. 

Having said that, if you do choose this path I stress you get it done professionally.

Male Incel without hate here... are any of you mentalcels?,"Full disclosure: I am a male incel lurker. However, I virtually only post if the incels without hate reddit.

Really here just to learn. 
      So, my use of ""mentalcel"" is to mean that your general physical attractiveness is not the issue but it's some form of mental
blockage. I feel it comes in two camps 1) some form of mental Illness that make you unattractive to men even if you're otherwise considered pretty/ attractive or 2) you have body dysmorphia or otherwise view yourself as unattractive in the face of reassurances from peers (not just friends or family that you know will lie to you). Maybe you just have thoughts and anxiety that men are disgusted by you when they aren't or you perceive others viewing you negatively. 
          I consider myself a mentalcel because I've actually posted pictures s of myself in forums and asked for brutal honesty (and got some negative comments but mostly from extreme blackpillera who hate themselves).  
    And I'll be upfront about a bias I have: men are more susceptible to mentalceldom because the burden of approaching is usually on the males shoulders in western society. I have this belief that since women are usually approached, an ther wise shy or anxious girl can count on being approached if she's otherwise attractive. Am I dead wrong?

How can they make sure less attractive but slightly average women like me feel happy ? 
Oh wait, there's not damn article or website that exists to even allow us being cherished without hate rhetoric. 

 We all know advice for men are:

Get a better personality ( which really means to earn more money) 

Work out ( some actually work out but many like to just earn money) 

Become a better person ( men half ass tend to do none of this). 

But none of this advice seems to work for us incel women.",Trufemcels
Did your Stacy friends ever use you to look more attractive?,"I remember going to the mall with my friend and she looked really pretty. Mini dress with bareback shoes. She's always been petite, smaller framed. I wore leggings with a dress and sandals. The whole time we were there guys were staring at her, more smiley and even the male customers were nicer to her. Then whenever they'd speak to me, their voices we're drier, their faces weren't as pleasant and their attitude was more like ""what do you want"". 

It's insane to feel like my friend doesn't notice this. Sometimes I feel as if people bring me alone just to make themselves look better.",Trufemcels
Why is it ok for malecels to refuse to get a prostitute but......,"Femcels aren't allowed to refuse random sexual encounters?  Malecels go on and on about how they don't want a prostitute because they want something real.  But when we don't want to be used like free prostitutes all of a sudden we are the bitches.  It's not women's fault that men are more sexually driven and therefor we -can- get sex with less effort, but why are we not allowed to not want it?  Just like how a man might feel used and still lonely after paying and fucking a prostitute, that's how we feel after having sex with men, in general.  At least the prostitute will cater to their sexual needs.  Random sexual encounters with men who don't care about us normally leaves us unsatisfied.  So, why should I waste my time and energy?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, they are hella hypocritical.  They get mad at women who they deem whores for having sex, but then are also mad at women that won't have sex with them.  So, they just want a woman to be ""a whore"" for them but not anyone else.  What the fuck makes them so special??  Just because I had sex with one person doesn't mean I have to have sex with anyone else under any circumstances.  Just like if you gave someone money it doesn't obligate you to give anyone else money.

Another thing that gets on my nerves is how curvy girls act like guys don't want them and they want us. THEY NEVER DID! Girls like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian or Marylin Monroe will ALWAYS be 1st place.

I give up on trying to find someone. Cool aunt dog lady life it is.,"It seems like the healthier thing for me to do is accept my place in the world and pursue a fulfilling life without romantic relationships.  Accepting this means I can no longer be injured by the things men say and do. I am not saying that a partner is unnecessary or unimportant. The preoccupation of all the things in which I lack results in very poor self esteem which, in the end, doesn't give me anything but grief anyway. By freeing up this major life goal, I can pursue a series of others. 

The truth is sex with people just for the sake of doing it will never fulfill me. I will always be hurt at the idea that someone only sees me as good enough for that. 

The cool aunt dog lady who fills her life with good works and fun activities seems pretty ok, considering. I will need some help in transitioning mentally and I wonder how long it will take but I am very determined to. I am also not completely writing children off but that is a next chapter and a lot of research I need to start.

I am determined not to LDAR or be a toxic human being going down this road. I may not be beautiful enough to love but I deserve to pursue some form of happiness all the same.

I can't help but feel like I am somehow lovable, but just too ugly for sex - if thats even a thing. Both my exes said there was nothing wrong with me, that I was an amazing and understanding person. They hope I find happiness because 'I deserve it'.

Question from a man who has friendzoned a woman,"So I found out about you guys from BasedShaman's video. I was really entertained by his incel content because I find weird stuff fascinating in general and I didn't know that there were such things as femcels. I understand that you guys are not like male incels who are looking for sex primarily, you are looking primarily for LTR. Anyway, I am a young horny male who wanted to have sex with a woman. She rejected my advances even if we made out first, she wanted a LTR first so I just friendzoned her after that basically. I don't think it was due to her looks, I just don't want a LTR right now. Many young males don't want that.

I'm wondering if I'm basically the ""enemy"" that you guys hate :P? Do you here feel that because of your looks males don't deem you worthy of a LTR, but just a hook-up/ casual sex?  Also what are your experiences with dating apps or dating sites? I know that me and my friends use those just looking for casual sex, is that the problem? Do you guys feel that if you were more ""attractive"" in your words that a LTR would be very easy to achieve?

Forward Notes:

I don't want anyone undergoing severely invasive procedures to achieve the ideal I wrote about. No one can achieve the perfect ideal but we can get close.

These suggestions are not in any particular order and do not all have to be done.

I hope everyone can give me honest criticisms and suggestions in the comments.

Sorry this took a long time to post.

‚Äã

Everyone's body goal depends on their prefered aesthetic and I stress emphasizing your natural features rather than doing drastic or invasive procedures to improve your appearance.

These are all common methods to increase SMV for women. I suggest choosing methods that you can *regularly commit* to depending on your schedule.

1. Thin, tall form: Men have long associated this with youth and therefore fertile and disease free

* A BMI of 17-20 was found most attractive in a mate among men in [this study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050601)
* A Torso : Legs ratio of 1 : 1.618

1. An Hourglass figure: Actually deemed more important than breast size

* A mate's Shoulders : Waist : Hips ratio is ideally 1.618 : 1 : 1.618 for perfect symmetry following proportions of the golden ratio.
* Ideal Female proportions as per this study:
   * Bust: 93.97 cm or 36.99 inches
   * Waist: 61.12 cm or 24.06 inches
   * Hips: 87.89 cm pr 34.60 inches

While these aspects depend on the genetic lottery we can all become closer to the ideal through the clothes we chose to wear and the exercise goals we keep.

‚Äã

**Section 1: Reducing fat in target areas**

Methods:

A. Targeted exercises

B. High Caloric Deficit / Fasting

C. Targeted Liposuction

‚Äã

A: Targeted Exercise

Note:: This strategy is meant to tone a specific area while reducing fat deposits. 

A moderate caloric deficit (between 20 - 30%) is required during these target. Your diet should have a macronutrient ratio with more protein if focused on muscle building. A guide to designing your diet  based on macronutrient ratio is[ here](https://shapescale.com/blog/health/nutrition/calculate-macronutrient-ratio/).

60-80% of your workout should still consist of high aerobic, calorie burning exercises. (This is assuming a toned and not muscular form is desired).

I recommend you log your activity, calories and progress using [this sheet](https://excelwithbusiness.com/blog/workout-tracker-calorie-counterall-in-excel/) and regularly track your target area measurements with [this sheet](https://thefitnessfocus.com/documents/body-measurement-chart.pdf).

Targeted exercise routines for [arm fat](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/fitness/arm-exercises/view-all/), [belly fat](http://www.menshealth.co.uk/fitness/the-5-best-exercises-for-burning-belly-fat), [thigh fat](http://www.superskinnyme.com/slim-thighs.html), [back fat](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/get-rid-of-back-fat-bra-bulge#instructions) are linked.

All weights pictured are really light and can be substituted for [everyday objects](https://www.darkironfitness.com/what-can-i-use-instead-of-dumbbells/)

‚Äã

B: High Caloric Deficit/Fasting

Intermittent fasting- Eating one meal at a specific hour everyday and fasting all other hours.

A guide to intermittent fasting is [here](https://www.perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-for-weight-loss/).

It is recommended to couple intermittent fasting with a[ ketogenic diet](https://www.perfectketo.com/what-is-the-ketogenic-diet/) for fast weight loss. The link provided can help you chose the diet that is right for your goals.

‚Äã

C: Targeted Liposuction

Liposuction is a quick but expensive method to displace fat deposits in targeted areas. This procedure can leave access skin folds so proper before and after care should be taken to better skin texture. Further information about the procedure and care can be found [here](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/cosmetic-procedure-liposuction#1).

Research reputed surgeons in your area be cautious about scams.

NOTE:: It is incredibly important to get this procedure done by a licensed and experienced professional

‚Äã

**Section 2: Increasing prominence of feminine features**

Targeted exercises for[ breasts](https://stylesatlife.com/articles/exercises-to-increase-breast-size/), [butt](https://greatist.com/move/bodyweight-butt-exercises) and [hips](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-4-best-exercises-to-work-hips.html) are linked.

‚Äã

**Section 3: Hourglass figures**

Note: Corsets and body shapers are temporary fixes. Excessive tightness can cause acid reflux and difficulty breathing.

A beginners guide to corsets is linked [here](https://www.orchardcorset.com/pages/corsets-101).

A Pinterest guide to body shapers is linked [here](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/570479477784451758/).

‚Äã

**Section 4: Supple Skin**

\- Regular exfoliation using gloves, pumice stone or sugar scrub (1-2 times a week)

\- Vitamin C lotion reduces look of uneven skin tone ( I personally use Nivea Vitamin C lotion with SPF 15 but[ Jerkins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0068YZVX8/ref=sspa_dk_detail_5?psc=1) is recommended)

\- Regular use of Sunscreen reduces wrinkles and stretch marks on your skin (SPF 30 is recommended, reapply every 6 hours)

\- Oil Massages improve hydration and reduces wrinkles/stretch marks (coconut oil tends to cause me fewer pimples: always buy food grade)

‚Äã

**Section 5: Hair removal**

If you have light body hair then shaving is recommended. If you have coarser body hair it is better (for look and feel) to wax or epilate, regular hair removal will cause hair to grow in finer or stop growing at all.

Regular exfoliation is key for all hair removal as ingrown hairs can always form.

‚Äã

Permanent methods:

a. Electrolysis: Takes less time then Laser and is permanent

b. Laser Hair removal: Makes hair grow back finer and sparser

‚Äã

Sensitive regions e.g. pubic area

a. Waxing is always a recommendation but regular exfoliation is required to prevent ingrown hair. Go to a spa for this area and ask for hard wax (causes less bleeding and pain).

b. Veet or Nair hair removal cremes for SENSITIVE AREAS is another option, be careful to follow instructions closely and do not use heavy amounts. People have reported chemical burns from trying this.

c.  Laser Hair removal: A little expensive but hairs grow back finer and sparser.

After mulling through the threads in both subs it's very obvious that the femcel community is much healthier than most male incel communities. I've generally found femcels to be more supportive and encouraging and uplifting not only with members within the community, but foster healthier perspectives of people outside of it as well - whereas incels unfortunately seem to embrace a darker, more ""shift-the-blame"" attitude. Granted there is one incel sub I've found on reddit that does a much better job of overcoming the toxicity within inceldom and there are a lot of good people there so far as I can see.

My question to the ladies in here is how do you see your situation in contrast to male incels?

**Nutrition and Healthy Living:**

Health cannot be faked so I stress this as most important for everyone.  This section should be used to serve as a basic guide as to implement the theory of weight loss: burn more calories than you eat (caloric deficit), and the theory of weight gain: eat more calories than you burn (caloric surplus) through a *controled and documented* process.

Weight change is a matter of adjusting your metabolism through long term lifestyle changes.

The following advice does not trump your doctor's. If you have a medical condition then it is best to consult a doctor.

*Step 1: Look at your lifestyle objectively*

We currently live in times where we have consistent jobs, low activity levels and high calorie foods rich in salt, sugars and fats. While this and the advent of improved medicine and infrastructure have improved the lifespan of humans on a whole, these are not the conditions we have evolved to be most efficient in.

‚Äã

Determine your[ BMI](https://bmi-calories.com/bmi-calculator.html) here. Determine your [Body Fat ](https://bmi-calories.com/body-fat-percentage-calculator.html)percentage here.

These calculators should tell you if either needs adjusting. Keep this in mind as you progress.

‚Äã

Over a 1-2 week period you should:

‚Äã

* Monitor and record your weight (once a day in morning before breakfast or evening after dinner)
* Monitor your typical food intake in a food diary. Approximate your macronutrient and calorie intake using this index website for common foods you eat. Record this in a journal or [Excel document](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/food-log.html)
* Monitor your exercise/activity levels in an [activity diary](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/pdf/physical_activity_diary_cdc.pdf).

**NOTE::**

This is meant to be control data. You should not engage in abnormal activity like vacation trips etc.

The longer period you use as data the more accurate results will be.

‚Äã

‚Äã

Taking the data you have gathered:

‚Äã

1. Has your weight fluxuated on a whole over the two week period?

* **Yes** means adjustment in caloric intake is required because your caloric intake is not equal to your expenditure.
   * Set a target BMI using [this chart](https://binged.it/2PvEuCf) where the green indicates healthy BMI (American Standard)
   * Using[ this calculator](https://bmi-calories.com/calorie-intake-calculator.html) and your current BMI, determine and record the calories needed to lose/gain weight healthily
* **No** means your metabolism is in line with your caloric intake and you should focus on preserving your caloric intake and activity level

1. What type of macronutrients have dominated your diet? Fats? Sugars? Protein?

Are you achieving the recommended levels of macronutrients per your body type? Read about the ideal[ here](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/macro-math-3-keys-to-dialing-in-your-macro-ratios.html)

* **No** means your body doesn't have the proper nutrients to repair and maintain itself optimally. You must change the types of food you eat to more healthy options.
   * From this data you will want to tailor a food plan that includes the amount of macronutrients needed. You may want to use this[ excel sheet](https://www.contextures.com/excel-weekly-meal-planner.html). When you create your meal plan remember plan your [daily calorie ](https://www.contextures.com/excelcaloriecounter.html)intake for future reference.
   * Reference:
      * [Food servings guide](http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/eating-nutrition/healthy-eating-saine-alimentation/food-guide-aliment/my-guide-mon-guide/mfg_p1-eng.php) fron GovCan showing the recommended amount of food groups for you and examples of said foods
      * [Healthy Recipe](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/)s

Tips for improved eating:

* Small portions
* Eat until you are 80% full
* Sleep the proper amount
* No snacking between planned meals

‚Äã

* **Yes:** Next step!

‚Äã

3. Are you getting the recommended level of exercise according to [this guide](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916)?

* **No** means your metabolism is likely not where it should be
   * Add time dedicated to exercise into your schedule to compensate and use [this sheet ](http://myexceltemplates.com/calories-and-exercise-chart-template/)to structure the components of your workout and calories this will burn.
   * Now look at the calorie counting chart for your meal plan in (2.): If it is more than your calorie goal you must supplement with further workout such that your calorie intake is desired.

‚Äã

* **Yes:** Good Job! You live a healthy lifestyle

Workout ideas can be found [here](https://www.bodybuilding.com/category/womens-workouts?tag=dropdown)

NOTE:: Specific body goals are in Section 1: Body.

Next Steps:

Implement your meal plan and excercise plan for 1- 2 months while monitoring weight. If you don't see a change then you must reflect over your changes and create a more extreme deficit or surplus in calories.

Doing this in a structured and recorded way is the best way to find what works for you.

‚Äã

On weight changes:

Diets are PERMANENT! You cannot stop a diet when you reach a goal weight, you must gradually adjust exercise levels over several months to allow your metabolism to adjust to a normal state (managable in the long term) and commit to that for a lifetime.

‚Äã

**Sleep and Relaxation:**

It is crucial to sleep the recommended 8 hours a day. This can reduce many health risks and prolong your life.

Tips to combat insomnia:

1. Exercise in the evening to tire yourself out
2. Eat meals 3 hours before bed
3. Do not eat calorie dense foods before bed
4. No caffeine, nicotine, alcohol near bedtime
5. Get off your phone 1 hour before bed
6. Meditation
7. Yoga

[Other tips from doctors](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes#2-7)

Sleeping and waking up at the same time everyday is known to increase energy as you body becomes good at predicting and optimizing energy usage.

‚Äã

**Balancing your life and Living Mindfully:**

I personally don't recommend anti-depressants (addictive) before you try all these activities:

It's important to have hobbies that excite you on top of a job or school to prevent burnout and reduce negative emotions (which tend to occur when you are doing something boring or mindless). Have patience and an open mind, attempt to add these activities to your daily life to see the effect they have on your mood.

I'd suggest picking one to two from [this list](http://9creativelives.com/2012/12/150-activitieshobbies-to-start-or-revist-when-youre-bored/) and spending as much free time as possible on them.

Idleness is often the cause of sadness so keep yourself busy.

‚Äã

I'd also suggest everyone choose 2 of these [Mindfulness exercises ](http://www.drivingpeace.com/simple-dbt-mindfulness-exercises-for-anxiety/#.W32CyT-pWM8)recommended by therapists.

My personal favorites:

1. Recall 3 things that went badly today, then recall 3 things that went well. If you have a bad day it's important to realize how significantly perspective can change things.
2. Go outside and observe the birds closely, discover what they are doing with their time. You might discover an interesting character in one of the birds.
3. Pet an animal

‚Äã

As women tend to be nurturing, caring and social by instict; you may find great fulfillment in building bonds and taking care of others.

In a world that is so often online we can get lonely this leads to sadness and resentment. It's important to go out into the real world and make friends and socialize.

Some activities that can help you:

1. Volunteer with children or the elderly
2. Visit dog parks or playgrounds and observe or make friends
3. Help with local charities : soup kitchens, thrift stores, habitat for humanity
4. Trade fairs, Farmers markets, Seminars
5. Local clubs
6. Meetup groups

üåøMod Check-In + Sub Rulesüåø,"Hey folks, 

Checking in with you to let you know this has been a particularly busy week for me with important business coming up that I have been prepping for, so as a result I haven't gotten a chance to work on those sidebar rules with other mods like I have wanted to. We WILL get there! 

On that note, I'd like everyone to give a round of applause for u/gigababejfl , my fellow mod, without whom the maintenance of the sub would not be possible. She really works extra hard to keep this place safe and clean and we're so lucky to have her! üíöüíï

The next order of business is regarding banning. We get a lot of backlash when we ban some pretty disgusting people (you wouldn't believe the rage moids have just for not being allowed to participate in a women-based forum that they claim is a joke anyway); but the most common response is ""Why was I banned?"" 

As a stated policy, let it be known that mods have the authority to ban at our discretion. This information was given to me by our Mod in Chief and Trufemcels creator. Basically this means that no one (and by this I really mean shitstirring moids, not femcels) is entitled to a legalese explanation of why they are banned. 

So here are the current things to keep in mind when participating in this sub:

1. No posts allowed from accounts under a day old 

2. No solicitation for photos or info of members

3. No telling or suggesting to anyone (even moids) that they should ""rope"" or any variation thereof. This will result in a temp ban. 

4. Banning is the discretion of the mod team and moid guests are not entitled to explanations of their banning which inevitably always turn into the moid taking the opportunity to get in one last scrap of female attention and to throw in one final dig. Frankly, we don't care, and such moids will no longer be taking up valuable time. 

Finally, I remind you all to report any behavior that you find concerning or inappropriate. This makes it so much easier for us to see the flagged comments/posts and take care of them promptly.

Thank you for reading and I hope you're all doing well! üåàüå§üíô",Trufemcels

Therapy for mentalcels,"What the hell is the therapist going to think of  that will be profound when I have spent years ruminating while LDARing? I don't think they're even capable of understanding certain concepts like how you can't just ""get out there"" and ""be yourself."" I would be treated like an alien if I even mentioned femceldom (I won't do that). I bet IncelTears could give me better (and free) advice versus some psychologist. 

Part of my issues comes from no social skills and fear of people basically which stems from lifelong abuse and bullying. I talked to a therapist about it and he told me to have *hope* and ""just get a part time job."" Nothing I say is well received. 

I have low self esteem about my looks and I am looksmaxxing, but again, the therapist will give some blue pilled advice. I will never be a somewhat attractive woman. I will never attract a man who values me...

It's just really sad that the way to get help is therapy and medication but neither has worked for me :(

Age of consent?,"My little niece turned 14 today and it gave me literal chills thinking about how some men on the internet, including incels, will write about how women are 'good to go' when puberty hits, or when they turn 13.

Their bodies are nowhere near fully grown yet, nor do they really understand what sex even means. Hell, I remember a askwomen post a while ago that really gave me shivers. It asked at what age most women noticed men acting weird around them - and sure enough, at age 9 it starts happening.

There is something motherly in me that just yearns to protect these young girls from such men - anyone feel the same?

Do you feel like your race plays into how men are attracted to you?,"My question is basically the title- I'm wondering if any other women feel like they're not beautiful because of their skin colour? There have been shades of some serious self-deprecation stemming from race that I've noticed on this sub, and I can't help but feel like race *does* play some role in how society views you. As an asian woman in North America (meaning Canada + USA) I definitely grew up under the impression that I was less than other white girls. I had my fair share of ""chinky"" slurs thrown my way by other beautiful girls growing up, and felt like boys viewed me as some ""other"" kind of girl they'd never be attracted to. All the flat chested, no ass, slanty eyed slurs were common in the change rooms, and both my other asian female friend and I both admitted to each other that we wished we were white. It felt like I wasn't allowed to be pretty or brave or beautiful, I could only be either the nerdy asian girl or the ""mysterious oriental sex object"" to the boys. 

I'll be honest here, when I first heard of ""Yellow Fever"" I was pretty happy. I'll never forget going to high school and wishing that some cute white boy would have yellow fever and make me his target. It's depressing to think about now that I'm in my senior year of college, but at the time the objectification made me feel more accepted and valued. I've kind of battled with my self-esteem throughout college, and I'm much more happy and comfortable in my skin colour today than I was graduating high school. 

I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether other women have had to deal with overcoming their self esteem issues stemming from their race/ethnicity? Like somehow you weren't viewed as an ""option"" because of your skin colour? We live in a society that pushes us towards the ideal being a blonde, blue eyed, big boobed ""Stacy""- something that other races won't ever be able to achieve. How did you overcome this nagging self-doubt that you won't ever be a mans first option, that he'll always view you as a 2nd choice? ",Trufemcels

Christine Chubbuck - The Tragic Story of a Femcel / Female Incel Who Took Her Own Life on TV,"I haven‚Äôt seen any other posts about Christine Chubbuck on this subreddit so I thought I‚Äôd tell you about her, for those of you that haven‚Äôt heard of her. She was a TV a Reporter and news anchor for a local network affiliate TV station in Sarasota, Florida and she is believed to be the first person to kill herself on live TV.

She suffered from depression but she was also a 29 year old virgin who was going to turn 30 in 2 weeks.  She had never had sex and had never had more than two dates with a man in her life and according to the people close to her, like her mother and brother, this was probably the biggest single reason she killed herself.  Today we‚Äôd call her a femcel or a female incel, but of course those terms were not used in 1974 I also want to point out that although looks are subjective, she wasn‚Äôt ugly at all and most men would consider her to be above average in looks.  So she wasn‚Äôt a femcel because she was ugly.  Here‚Äôs an album of some pictures of her https://m.imgur.com/gallery/T0Rob

Christine disproves the theory that women cannot be incels, or that women can only be incels if they are very ugly.  There are a lot of women far less attractive than her who are not femcels.

In 2016 two movies about her came out. One is a biopic called ‚ÄúChristine‚Äù and it is currently available on Netflix. I recommend watching it.  If you are interested in watching a movie about the true story of a trufemcel who‚Äôs incel status might have cost her her life, you‚Äôll want to watch it.  The other movie on her that came out that year was ‚ÄúKate Plays Christine‚Äù but I haven‚Äôt seen that yet.  I recommend watching ‚ÄúChristine‚Äù first since it‚Äôs a more typical biopic.  You may also want to google her for more info on her life.

Christine Chubbuck‚Äôs story really shows the pain and suffering a femcel can go through in life, that in her case drove her to publicly kill herself, and that femcels can exist who are not ugly and who are even local celebrities.",Trufemcels

First of all, I don't encourage suicide by any means, I just wanted to share how miserable this post made me feel and ask for advice how not to feel suicidal seeing something like this.

I'm 21 and will be 22 in less than a month. Being ugly defined my whole life, but everyone gaslighted me into thinking that it's in my head and I do something wrong. I feel ashamed that I just realized this.

My skin is noticeably worse than it was 1-2 years ago, I'm getting old.. I wasted my best years suffering alone, I didn't even have friends. Even if I had money for surgery, I don't have time, because by the time all surgeries are done, I will be too old. Not to mention the fact that some of the flaws can't be corrected at all.

I will never look like this, men will never truly love me or even truly desire me sexually. No one has ever asked me out for a date, no one has ever held my hand etc.

Lookism in society,"*Lookism:*

*- prejudice or discrimination based on physical appearance and especially physical appearance believed to fall short of societal notions of beauty.*

*(via Webster)*

There is no doubt being good looking gives you many advantages in life. In my childhood the lookism bias in society was denied in the parental bubble, resulting in me hitting to ground hard later on in life.

I've been wondering if it's better to have a society that's open about lookism like South Korea or one that likes to deny it like most liberal Western countries.

‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: All new posts soliciting photos/implying the solicitation of photos will be deleted and the poster will have an automatic 3-day Temp Ban ‚ö†Ô∏è,"First of all, this is nothing new as this is a practice we mods (and certainly I, in particular) have been employing this whole time. It has been an unwritten rule that no solicitations of pictures or info are allowed because of the risk of doxxing - but now it's a formally written rule. See it. Mark it. Remember it. 


The same happens to users in comments. If a person solicits pictures or infos in the comments section, he or she faces automatic temp ban. 

This is not the place to fish for information that could doxx our members. We will have **zero tolerance** for this in the future. 

Today a moid posted something along the lines of, ""I wonder what you all look like, you can't be that bad, share your pics."" This type of post / comment **is** considered ban-able solicitation. 

I also think that, aside from being dangerous, these types of posts bring down the morale of the sub. We do not need or want that kind of garbage here.

So I will say it one more time:

**Do not request personal information or pictures from any members.** First offenders get a temporary ban; second time is permanent. 

If you see someone doing this or if someone solicits your info/pic, please report them **immediately**. If you're not sure if what someone is doing is soliciting for info/pics, please message the mods and we will work it out with you. 

Thank you.",Trufemcels

Shit Personality? ü§î I Don't Know About That.,"I've seen more than a few femcels on this sub describe not only their looks as being subavg, but their personalities, as well. 

What does it mean to have a shit personality, as I have seen others claim they possess? 

In my mind, a shit personality is when you knowingly and willfully treat others like crap - examples are trolls who spend their time looking for a fight by consciously ripping others apart - or people who are so self-absorbed that they don't take any notice of the lives of those around them. 

A shit personality is **not**: being socially awkward, shy, serious, quiet, loud, weird sense of humor, persnickety, blunt, or imperceptive of social norms. 

I'd like to think that most people identifying as having a shit personality are actually just being hard on themselves, as many of us here are wont to do.

I wake up at 5:30 am every day, poop, get ready, etc. I walk about 8-10 miles a day on weekdays and 10-15 miles on weekends. 

I used to jog three times a week instead of walking (so every other day I would jog instead of walk for 3 miles or so) then I tore a tendon in the front of my ankle so I started walking instead again. 

Not only that, but Monday through Friday I work out a solid hour from 8:30-8:45 until 9:30-10 pm. 

I eat fine. This week I switched to 3-4 hard boiled eggs for breakfast and a handful of baby tomatoes and I still gained 3 lbs. Maybe it‚Äôs because of my period, who knows. 

But I am still not skinny or fit looking. I feel the muscle under my fat, but I still look chubby. While I am certainly not obese, I still am very insecure and depressed. I know I am almost post wall and that I never was a young beautiful fit thing.

I have been jotting down a list of rules that I have been meaning to transcribe (type) to share with the other mods to work on what will be in the sidebar. I have just been very busy of late with my personal life; however! I wanted to let you know that it IS being worked on, it WILL be addressed, and we will have things hammered out soon.

One rule that I've already posted about and we agree on as a temporary measure is **no posts allowed from accounts under 1 day old**. 

I am sure we (the mods) will, as a team, work on expanding that or clarifying it or whatever have you, but for now that is the ad hoc rule as we try to keep shitposting to a minimum.  

Sorry for this interruption, but I wanted to remind people as I have had to request people to save their posts and repost at a later time a few times in the past few days. I hate having to ask people to redo their posts because a) it's not something I want to do to the people who post good content, and b) it does get tiring.

So I hope you have read this if you are a new account, because at a certain point as the sub continues to grow I will not be able to ask every less-than-one-day-old poster to save their content before it gets removed, and I'm sure the other mods are equally preoccupied with their own responsibilities.

""  I think when guys tell women ""just be fit/thin"" they are only thinking  of the **kind of body they want to have sex with**, not the kind of *woman* they can *love* ""

Having sex with a body..

See how men don't even consider women with ugly faces human beings. They are bodies. Either ugly bodies (so worthless) or desirable bodies.

So what kind of woman can a man truly love?  Can a man genuinely love a woman or they mostly feel lust which fades quickly..

"""At least you can get sex""","Well at least men can betabuxx. The same men that put us on a pedestal for being able to be used for sex, are complaining about being able to be used for money. 

Being used as a hole is *not* validating or meaningful in any kind of way, in fact it is degrading because you're only good enough to be a hole, and too undesirable for anything else. Being used for sex is not validating and fulfilling the same way being used for money is not validating and fulfilling. Being *used* for something never is. 

And if sex is a ""human need, like food and water"", and if men expect us to be grateful and happy just for being able to get sex, they can visit a prostitute. Then they can get sex as well. But a lot of men don't want to do that because then they say that it's not just about sex, it is about intimacy and someone being attracted to you as well. 

Well men have higher sex drives than women. Men even fuck prisoners. Therefore a man having sex with an ugly woman does not mean that he is attracted to her. Their high sex drives just want to make them stick their dick in any hole. If they were actually physically attracted to us, they would be potentially interested in a relationship as well. Men would fuck a lot more women than they would date, and would want to be seen with. 

And women have lower sex drives because they aren't biologically hardwired to fuck as many people from the opposite sex as possible, like men are, so women don't even *want* meaningless/casual sex in the first place like men do. Women want intimacy in sex even more than men do. There is no intimacy involved in being pumped and dumped. Telling women ""at least you can get sex"", is like telling men ""at least you can get free tampons today"". Projecting your own wishes onto someone else who's in an inherently different situation with different wishes and needs is unethical and senseless. 

And on ""betabuxxing"", *at least* men have such an option, and at least they get a relationship out of it. In the betabuxx scenario: even IF the woman wouldn't have married the man if he didn't have a job, that doesn't mean that she doesn't loves him for who he is and that they don't have a bond. She can have the standard of her partner having a job, and meet someone like that and grow to love him. This is not being used for money. And some men have no problem being truly used for money as long as it's by an attractive woman, as they marry an attractive woman from abroad who's way above his league knowing she's marrying him just for a citizenship/money.  

What do women get out of being used for sex? An even lower self-esteem and self worth for being used and thrown away. And if we wanted physical pleasure, we could do that ourselves.

Both genders can get sex. But ugly men have it better, because they can be wanted despite being ugly. 

And more on the concept of betabuxxing, the issue is that ugly (incel) men think that if they get married, it will always be because the woman is using him for his money. But them thinking that women are incapable of loving ugly men is just projection, since they don't want ugly women themselves, and therefore think that they can never be actually wanted either.

And men only see marrying an ugly woman as betabuxxing, they see marrying an attractive woman as escaping inceldom.",Trufemcels

But this guy was different i developed a serious feeling toward him. He had the personality I asked for, the personality that most guys never had. I started to go crazy, telling my friends how cute or cool he is, I went to level that I told my strict parents about him. IK I was an idiot. I tried to be closer to him join classes he was at or go the same path as he go or trying to talk t ok him I just wanted him to notice me but when he did, he started to avoid me no matter what. When I got the message I tried to forget him but I couldn't I felt very angry and depressed.

The senior prom was about to come, since freshman year I planned to have girls nightout with my buds but when the time comes, I canceled it I couldn't bare seeing him with her hugging each other and dancing. I spend my whole prom night at bed crying. I Gave up. That's how my ""Young love"" that every idiot person told me to fall for. This this what love is? Man I wish I never felt it, worst feeling ever. I promised myself to never love a man ever. Afterward I didnt give attention to him, he started to stare at me for some reason but I didnt give half shit. He knew I liked him.

I'm suppose I have been what is called volcel (I really wasn't emotionally ready to ""get back out there"") for the past year or so after the conclusion of a multi-year relationship (since 2011) that wasn't going to go anywhere and subsequently fell apart.  In the past I have not had much luck with girls/women and what little I have had I imagine has been more up to luck than any skill on my part.  So, when I say returning to the dating pool I did was prepared for a difficult journey I hope you can understand.  However, what I have found online dating to have become in my absence is detestable.  The quality of the women (not as a group but the actual quality of person each women at least presents herself to be) available is frankly horrifying...bordering on revolting.  I'm a bit of an introvert and reserved personality and I appreciate those qualities in prospective mates, so bar and nightclub hopping isn't really an option either.  I feel like all the ""good women"" (at least by my subjective standards) are in hiding.  I thought maybe some of them might be here, perhaps?  I figured it couldn't hurt to at least give it a try.  I realize that my mere presence here is likely to illict some anger and my intentions even more.  I'm sorry for what distress I cause but I felt compelled to at least try in the vain hope that there is hope.

I figure its only fair that I tell a bit about who I am if I'm going to expect others to make a leap of faith by contacting me.  I currently live in California in the ""East Bay area"" of the San Fran area.  I grew up back east in what most would consider the South (of the US, if that is not clear).  As I mentioned before I prone to being reserved and I have a strong desire for privacy (namely why I haven't included a picture of myself).  I had a rough childhood (who didn't?) so I can be difficult and stubborn at times, particularly when it comes to my life; I do not suffer well people inconsiderately imposing upon me.  In reflection of that I have a strong predeliction to not be an imposition on others.  I'd be lying if I said it doesn't affect me socially, but its never been a major source of friction in my intimate relationships, ie. with people who are allowed behind the walls.  I'm 5'10 and while it can fluctuate a bit, depending on how well I am taking care of myself, I weigh 145 lbs.  Definetely in the lanky or thin category.  Independent judges peg me as moderately attractive.  I'm white (pale, as much from heritage as behavior) and I have long brown hair (bit past shoulders) that is thinned out a bit at the temples but I seem to largely have avoided baldness (for now, /fingerscrossed).  I don't suffer from any major mental or physical ailments (I guess I should mention my vision is quite bad in case that applies for anyone).  I do not make a lot of money but I easily support my lifestyle - I have no desires to dedicate myself to the pursuit of the dollar.  I'm not very religious (I was vehemently anti-religious in my younger days) but I was raised up in a Southern Baptist enviroment; I usually tell people that I'm a private deist. I think I might want kids one day but I'm not completely sold on it.  I live in a house with 3 other guys (well, one of the guys recently had his gf move in) and I pay my way; ie. no basement dwelling.

I'm looking for someone who lives in my general area who'd be interested in getting together to see if there is any potential for a relationship.  Physically speaking I'd be fibbing if I said I don't have a ""type"" but I have dated outside of it before with no regrets so I see no reason to start now.  As long as a good faith effort is made to look attractive and stay healthy, that can often be more attractive than ""your genes.""

I feel like I have droned on long enough on something that is likely going to be fruitless and equal has shares of just getting deleted.  If anyone has any questions (even if they aren't interested), you're welcome to reply below or message me directly.  Thanks for the time.",Trufemcels

Need some (serious) advice from femcels,"I seriously need some advice please don't ban my post, I've tried asking this in other subs and I usually get shamed and hate for not being liberal enough. This is something that's made me worried and depressed about my future, and future family life.

**Some Background**: I went to a very strict religious private school for high school, where the girls thought they where badasses if they showed up 5 minutes late to class, no one dated or did anything more then kissing or hold hands in my high school, but now I'm about to enter the real world. **And dam I've realized the real world is really different then the bubble I was raised in.**

I'm a virgin guy about to start college in September, and I want someone like myself. I'm good looking and at the very least definitely average, but anything that's around average in looks is good enough for me.

I want to meet someone in college, and get married soon after, I don't believe theirs any point in delaying marriage to ""explore"" like some people tell me I should.

So how common are ""femcels"" of average looks in real life really, and I mean a real femcel, someone who hasn't fucked, made out with or grinded with some player. 

Not just someone who hasn't has a boyfriend , someone who hasn't done any casual sex either, someone who hasn't gone to parties and made out with and grinded on random dudes.

 A true virgin. I can tolerate a past boyfriend if it only went far as making out, or kissing as long as it wasn't at a party with some dude she met 5 minutes ago. 

I would also strongly prefer someone that dresses with her body more covered up. My older sister tells me that casual sex happenings in college is over exaggerated, but I'm seriously worried I wont find someone to marry who meets my basic standards in college.

Reading from this sub there are a lot of women who can't find boyfriends but they have engaged in casual sex, or making out and grinding, activities. I just can't be with someone like that. **I don't look down or judge women like that, but I truly just want someone like myself.** I have no interest in going to parties or fucking hookers in college either so my standard is basically looks average, and hasn't played around. **So how hard is it to find a virgin like that (who also hasn't kissed or felt up random dudes) of average looks in college?**

Another story I thought up regarding a femcel,"Suppose there's two girls cleaning a classroom up after school. One of the girls, Stacy, has a very clear face, whereas the other girl, Sebacea, has an acne-covered face. 

Stacy begins to taunt Sebacea. ""When you went up to the chalkboard for your presentation, Seebee, you looked so \*red\*! Were you embarrassed?"" Stacy giggles.

""No, it's just this skin irritation I have, my mon won't let me take Accutane, she says it'll give me cancer"", Sebacea replies, sighing.

""Well, you need it, you looked like a pizza up there!"" Stacy leaves Sebacea to finish the cleaning. ""See ya later, pizza face!""

Sebacea finishes the cleaning while shedding angry tears. She needs a way to get revenge on Stacy and improve her situation.

While walking home, Sebacea encounters a witch. She knew the woman was a witch because of her witch's hat and black cat which followed nearby. 

The woman approached Sebacea and said ""I've been watching you, and I think you're a good candidate to be my champion, because you're prettier on the inside than on the outside. I need you to take this mirror and when Stacy upsets you again tomorrow, point it at her."" 

She hands Sebacea the mirror. It was ugly, slimy, and it had an eye at the base which dripped mucus periodically.

Sebacea went to school the next day, and when Stacy started up the exact same taunts as yesterday, she pointed the mirror at the clear-faced girl. Immediately, the mirror flashed brilliantly, and it began to fire a whitish-glossy vapor at Stacy. Sebacea couldn't control the mirror, she watched in shock as Stacy's face began to get covered with boils, pimples, and rosacea of many hues. 

After about a minute of Stacy's screaming, Sebacea looked into the mirror. It was now the most beautiful mirror she had ever seen, and her face was clearer than ever.

Sebacea went to school the next day. Stacy was nowhere to be seen. A few people asked Sebacea to join them at Starbucks after theater practice, life couldn't be better for the girl.

While walking to Starbucks, Sebacea saw the witch again. She was sitting on a bench, texting, but she also held another ugly mirror in her hand....",Trufemcels

http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122412445802

This study, which is based on many other cited studies, shows women only orgasm 11% of the time in one night stands, men are less likely to engage in acts that lead to orgasm for women (like clitoral stimulation and cunnilingus) in casual hookups as opposed to relationships, and men are less likely to put effort into making a woman come in casual hookups. In fact these studies show men on average state they don‚Äôt even believe women are entitled to sexual pleasure with casual sex, but men do state they believe women are entitled to sexual pleasure in a relationship.

http://healthland.time.com/2013/11/11/no-satisfaction-woman-are-less-likely-to-orgasm-during-casual-sex/

A few studies showing men are twice as likely as women to orgasm during a casual hookup, and that women orgasm almost twice as much in a relationship as opposed to a hookup.

https://abcnews.go.com/Health/ReproductiveHealth/sex-study-female-orgasm-eludes-majority-women/story?id=8485289

75-80% of women can‚Äôt orgasm from intercourse alone. Since men are unlikely to engage in cunnilingus or clitoral stimulation in a casual hookup, there‚Äôs not much chance of sexual pleasure for a woman having a casual hookup.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/42tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_42_arrests_by_sex_2012.xls

Men commit the vast majority of violent crime, especially rape and murder. So casually hooking up with an unknown person is much more dangerous for women than it it for men. It could get women raped, beaten or murdered.

https://www.sexualhealth.com/why-women-are-more-at-risk-for-stds-than-men_n_1592/

Women are at much greater risk than men to contract an STI. So casual hookups carry a greater STI risk for women than they do for men. 

Also, obviously, women have to worry about getting pregnant while men don‚Äôt, so that‚Äôs another risk women take with casual sex.

Also women‚Äôs reputations take a negative hit for having engaged in casual sex, but men are viewed more positively for the same thing.

https://www.acog.org/-/media/For-Patients/faq020.pdf

75% of women sometimes experience pain with penetration. Pain is especially common when men won‚Äôt engage in foreplay‚Äîproven to be the case in most casual hookups. So casual hookups are not only unlikely to be pleasurable for women, but are likely to cause them actual pain.

Casual sex increases men‚Äôs feelings of happiness and self esteem, but not women‚Äôs.

https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/vbpx5y/casual-sex-women-men-regrets

Women are much more likely to regret casual sex than men.

"""Femcels only want Chad"" is an outright lie.","If a Chad mentalcel chose any femcel, it would make her a life long target for ridicule. People would gaslight her for the rest of her life.

Have you ever heard of loyal men for anyone other than gigastacy? Men are only as loyal as their options. Many of them deaperately try to be disloyal even if they have no options.

Chad does not make sense as a figure in my own daydreams. 

The only reason moids think there is a Chad only rule is because this is what Stacy and Stacylites wants (rightfully so) and they get mad she is so clear about this. They don't even see ugly women. We are edited out of their field of vision.  We only exist as targets to bully or prey on.

Feminism versus Pink Pill,"I'm a volcel r/Braincels user, but I support [asexuality.org](https://asexuality.org) as well as this sub for their common views on social attitudes towards relationships. It might be worth checking out asexuality whether you identify as one or not. There's a diverse range of types of people in the community and they have some meetups where you can small talk with peers who don't identify as either gender (mostly born female but not feminine).

I identified as a feminist growing up, but I identify more closely as an anti-feminist currently because I don't even remember feminism standing for anything like what I see argued today. I remember it was about empowering women to have the same opportunities in life that men have, but it seemed to ignore the plights of most women who need it the most and now it's been hijacked by ""Stacy's"" crew (calling most feminists I see ""Stacy"" sounds a bit off, but they're calling for more privileges for the already privileged while ignoring people who are ignored).

I can understand how difficult it must be to have to struggle with establishing a career as an independent woman as well as take care of a single-person household or go through the hassle of finding a suitable roommate. On top of that there's the dating struggles and the endless barrage of aggressive men who assume that you're just looking for a short term fling (both genders are guilty of this, at least in low-income neighborhoods and among 18-30 year old age groups). The worst part is being told by society that you should avoid having children because your genetics aren't to the highest superficial standard regardless of how intelligent and capable you happen to be in your skills and accomplishments.

Anyways, what is the common opinion on feminism here and what could feminists do better to address the pink pill and the femcel community? Do you think it would help if there was more emphasis on committed and faithful relationships as opposed to the present attitude promoting promiscuity which actually drives men away from commitments? The ""body positivity"" movement is a total laughingstock but I think there is merit to trying to bring more glamour or at least familiarity to the average woman's figure instead of raising the expectation for all women to fit an unrealistic body type (I call it the Louis Vuitton size 0 figure, which could frankly stand to gain 30 pounds or so).

"What if there were ""cuddling centers"" at workplaces and universities?","You could go in and there would be couches/futons set up to cuddle on, maybe a few apple cinnamon scented air fresheners, some soft music playing in the background.

It's interesting to think about some of the issues relating to running this service:

Would there be many people willing to be cuddlers?

What if some cuddlers (the people hired/volunteered to cuddle with patrons) got more people to cuddle with them than others?

What if some cuddlers were only okay with cuddling with one gender?

What if one person keeps on coming in and hogging all the cuddling time, would there need to be appointments set up?

What if one person comes and he has really bad body odor and nobody wants to tell him?

What if one person gets really attached and wants to have a relationship with one of the cuddlers?

What if a patron gets gropey with one of the cuddlers?

What more do I have to do???,"I always thought of myself as a 6/7 up until I moved to a European country for high school, where 99% of my classmates were white. I was the only Asian girl in my grade. I was 5‚Äô4 and all the other girls were mostly tall and blond. Being a perfectionist, I wanted to become the alpha girl. I would work out a lot, buy tons of new clothes, practice applying makeup, and do my hair every morning. I woke up about 2 hours early before school to get ready. I studied really hard too, because I wanted to get into a top uni. Nothing worked. Guys just used me as their ‚Äústudy buddy‚Äù, and never gave me a second look. The only guys that approached me were creeps with fetishes. I was heartbroken, but I thought maybe I would meet someone in my adulthood where there would be a variety of people. I ended up just using my time in college focusing on getting into med school, but I had high hopes to meet someone during my time in med school. I feel like such an idiot. All the guys here have very high standards of themselves and think they all deserve a perfect 10 Stacy. They don‚Äôt really care about how smart a woman is, how hardworking she is, or anything like that. They just care about looks, and even though I have always worked hard on my looks as well, I still won‚Äôt be good enough because I am a petite East Asian woman.

I Have Never Been Asked Out on A Date In College. How Is It The Best Place To Find a Spouse?,"Have you girls ever heard this one? How the best place to find a husband is in college because you will never be around so many potential partners again? I vaguely remember a controversial article about this from an Ivy League school mom but outside of the outrage,  people have said this.

Yeah, I have never ever been asked out there. Cute couples absolutely everywhere but no hand holding or kisses for me.

Any guy I hoped to have a chance with was already taken or into stacies only.  Not at all even talking about frat guys, athletes, general studs of campus or anything. Any race, skin condition, height, it didn't matter. I can find all types of men attractive to me.

I remember this one friend I used to study with. He was skinny and short and so fun and I had the biggest crush on him. Anything nice he said about me would be savored in my heart for like  the rest of the month. When I tried to ask him out a few times he would suffer about the girl who broke his heart.

Grad school is my next opportunity. A lot of the professional schools are close to each other and some even share grounds with the undergrad. Forget finding a husband for a moment. How does one even get a date?  Hard not to feel like an alien but I am clearly missing something or just uglier than I can ever admit to myself

But what I don't seem to understand is the straight up rejection on incels claiming they only want stacies when they clearly wouldn't mind giving a shot with you guys, just look at /r/inceldate LOL there's literally no femcels in there and you guys complain about being lonely, whereas incels who can't get a date are in abundant or actually makes it up entirely, they are out there and willing.

The most common response to this seems to be that,:

&gt; ""Incels are women hating, misogynists who only want stacy"" 

which is pretty flawed, since although there may be some incels like you mentioned.. 

Have you ever considered that there are incels just like you guys, just looking for love and affection but shun by the dating world because of your looks and honestly I can bet that, [that male incel never had even one proposal whereas you guys get many lol](https://i.redd.it/23h0qzcflqa11.png) but that's a different subject for a different time.

Men have a much stronger racial preference when it comes to who they want to be in a relationship with. And lets be real men are also more likely to be straight up racist. The second biggest political party in my country has neo nazi roots and its not a shocker that they have twice as many male supporters compared to women. The whole racism thing gets so hypocritical when it comes to incels. They complain about supposedly no woman wanting them while simultaneously deemimg any girl who isnt white or possibly asian as subhuman. All men regardless of race only want white and asian women. Whereas men can be deemed extremely attractive regardless of race.

Im of middle-eastern ancestry and I know for a fact that my race plays a big part in never finding love. Guys in my country claim that immigrants are coming in and ""stealing"" ""their"" women because they dont even consiser non-white girls as an option.

Triggered as fuck.

I don't even really listen to this sort of music especially these days.  This randomly came on and I stopped dead in my tracks and cried and cried. You know that ugly cry where you know no one is looking?

Replayed so many times. I haven't even heard the rest yet. 

Do you have any song, no matter the genre, the lyric, the mood, doesn't matter.. Share a sweet spot that made you really feel.  Backstories welcome. Youtube links with specific min where it got you welcome. Doesn't need to be lyrics. Just music moods too. 

\- - - - backstory - - - -

No desire to alienate any femcel of any other race. Just sharing this feeling. Seeing hate from Black men and Incels. The alienation is identical. And that's before we ever get to mainstream society.

Being made to feel unworthy when all you did was be born.

I'm not even religious. But the sentiment in that lyric feels fluent.

I forgot why I ever abandoned music when it is one of the only things that will envelope you regardless of what you look like. You get so used to just trying to live, where life is just hazardous to your health. 

I was just savoring a rare day off doing busy work with youtube playing in the background. I remember thinking I need to add music back into my plan to be happy despite being femcel. So many pretty voices regardless of look? 

Like a lifestyle choice, go to live shows including what is not mainstream music. I was happy to be reminded there are people out there who recognize that wavelength where the best of humanity and relation lives. I personally forget. I look at cute Reddit pets and touching stories that hit ALL with thousands of votes. 

Jfl. Either we figure these emotions out, live with the torture for many decades, or rope?

Aging is depressing,"As if women don't have being ugly to worry about, they also have aging to worry about. Aging is probably even more depressing, because as much as you can change your looks, you can't do anything about aging. Men prefer women as young as possible, starting from 18. Not only appearance wise, but also the idea of an inexperienced, pure 18 year old turns them on. Therefore even an attractive 24 year old girl isn't wanted as much as an attractive 18 year old girl. Women become less desirable with every year. Men of all ages are most attracted to 20 year old women. Good luck staying 20 for the rest of your life and being what a guy *actually* wants. This is the standard that women are held to. Even Stacies aren't safe, because once she loses her looks, her husband will lust after young, attractive women again. He will *always* desire and lust after such women. Every man. It's in their nature, and their nature doesn't disappears once they get married. It's men's biological drive to fuck as many women as possible. Women having the ability to love and wanting love is a fucking joke, as we can never get love from men. Male ""love"" is based on lust. ""True love"" is only for attractive women who fulfill his desires. ",Trufemcels
In What Way Can Being Used For Sex Be Beneficial to Femcels,"I like to think there is rhyme to all reasons. Even if you are a certified psychopath. Maybe a voice that sounded real told you to do it.

I welcome their sex bot overlords but their glee about it tells me how they see women.  Not sentient beings. Not people worth holding and touching and making love to and fucking between two instead of sex for one with charity case pussy.

Would a man befriending a woman here be seen as predatory as a man trying to get a date with a woman here? Would it be a bannable offence? Again, it's not something I would do. It's hypothetical.

I suspect that femcels would be less hostile to men who approach them IRL. The problem is, men don't know who is a femcel IRL because it's hard to tell if a woman is femcel unless she posts here and ""wears the label"". A man who would approach what he thinks is a femcel would be seen as trying to get an easy hookup. A man who approached an attractive woman would be seen as delusional. There really is no way to win. Remember, more and more laws are being passed to make it an offence to approach a woman (#metoo) IRL, so it's hard for us to get to know you.

But back on topic, is it an offence here? Would it be met with calls to mods to ban the guy? Again, don't attack me for this because it is not something I will do here. I am just curious.",Trufemcels

‚Ä™Tinder fat suit experiment reveals‚Ä¨ unsurprising double standards we‚Äôve known all along.,"The experiment shows what happens when a Tinder date shows up much larger in person than they appear in profile photos. After setting the subjects up with dates, one man and one woman were put into fat suits and sent out to their dates. Guess who received the most vitriol in the process? You guessed it, the woman. 

The conversations between male dates and the female subject quickly turned from curiosity to disgust:
""I really don't appreciate people lying to me,"" one guy said as he stormed out of the restaurant. ""I'm a little agitated,"" another said. ""It's very upsetting. I wasted gas and my time to come over here and I can't do this.""
The two other guys quickly devised escape plans. One said he was married, and the other asked where the restroom was, only to never return. In the end, just one male date stuck around long enough to be told the whole thing was an experiment.¬†
https://youtu.be/2alnVIj1Jf8

When replicated for the male subject, the responses were quite different. The female dates seemed less repulsed, at least outwardly, and actually engaged him in conversation.
They also were quicker to forgive him for what were apparently very outdated profile pictures. 
The end result? The guy got a handful of second dates, and even got a cheeky kiss from one, unlike the girl, who went home without any interest from the would-be male suitors.¬†

A question for all you femcels,"What are some specific stories you have involving rejection? I want to know the experiences that made you turn into a femcel. 

For me (im not sure if i fully classify as a femcel yet) it involves being rejected and friendzoned by two guys ,not chad-ish at all btw, two nerdy, geeky intelligent funny socially awkward unpopular guys, the first one have a beta face and feminine features and was 5'6 ( but i started crushing on him in middle school when he used to be much shorter than me) and the second one was one who all my friends made fun of bcuz he was below conventional attractiveness-although he was initially physically unnattractive to me becams more attractive when we became good friends and realized we had a lot in common and shared many ideologies. When i look at him now i find him the most attractive person.

The first guy who i was best friends with for many years, i decided to confess feelings for him. After all, i had become so emotionally attached from having him as a shoulder to cry on, all our conversations and late night talks, etc. 

He confessed he used to like me, but he has feelings for a new girl that are the ""strongest"" hes ever had.

Upon realization i was very upset, but the girl he claimed to like had rumours  going on about her being preppy, bitchy, snobby and narcissistic at our school. I decided to avoid these rumours because I dont want to be prejudiced but she ended up in one of my highschool classes and she was in deed a super  sassy, girly, has a rich daddy and mean stacy. She was a performer type girl, cocky and popular-and according to my ex best friend the qualities he ascribed to her are that she is ""that she has so much purity and innocence, the way she walks and giggles infafuates me"", and yes, this stacy type chick is not a person who sleeps around but she does use guys. He claimed to have the deepest connection with her but when he sent me the texts of their supposedly deep comvos they were nothing but baseline convos regarding their interests to which she always repsonded ""oh hehe"" and heart eyes and ""oh okay"" no dialogue at all. All she does is have to respond yes, no and haha like a bot bcuz she is pretty and to him she seems like the most amazing person but really its only because he feels validated. When a girl is pretty her personality seems more amplified than what it actually is. If she has average intellect she is ""so smart!"" If she just laughs at his jokes out of the sake of being nice ""she is so funny."" Because i knew my best friend very well and his fucked up morbid humour is exactly like mine. We actually share the same interests like philosophy, politics, astronomy and we enjoy the same shows. 
Fast forward, turns out this girl was just using her to make another guy jealous. She simultaneously had a THING WITH ANOTHER GUY as they had a ""fling"" at the same time and when i confronted him on this he said ""yah i know but im willing to stay by her no matter what. I want to marry her.""
What a fucking joke. Men are emotionally weak as hell. 
Anyways, since she was a snobby type girl they always fought a lot but he simped for her and eventually they didnt work out. Its been a year and he still obsesses over her. He claims to ""love her"" but also simultaneously calls her a bitch and fake flirts with people when shes around in hopes she'll get jealous. We are not friends anymore due to seperate reasons like the fact he stopped emotionally supporting me and caring about me, lied to me, started backstabbing me and when I brought up my problems like my deep depression and abusive family and always left me and seemed to stop caring, but when this girl he liked complained about small issues like whining about her dad not letting her get a nose piercing hed over empathize with her. Its shows that integrity is rarely genuine in men caring for women unless she is an object of his infatuation. Its funny because hes one of those guys that underdtands how stupid the whole thing is very deep down and also says he hates people who complain about small problems (but then literally supports the chick he liked for all her bs problems) but the moment a guys dick gets hard they contradict their ""morals"" just to get into her pants. He talks about how important a similar interests but they had zero things in common. When she said she liked something like a tv show hed go read about it on wiki and come back to pretend he was the biggest fan ever. I always supported him through his depression and family problems. He apologized to me in many paragraphs saying he was truly sorry, I forgave him but refused to restore the friendship.

The second guy is a guy im talking to recently. We are similar and also different in so many ways and share the same values. He told me ""u can talk to me about anything u know;)"" and he is much more emotionally available than the first guy. I told him ill be there for him as well, as we both have depression and a chronic illness/health related issues. that prevents us from doing everyday things. After talking to him for a while he told me ""i like 2 girls rn but i dont know which one i like the most."" Lmao 2 girls? Is this what males are like? Men seem emotionally intelligent until u see the way they view women.  You cant love multiple people at once.  Im pretty sure one of them is not me, but like even if it was its idiotic hed tell me he likes someone else and cant decide on who. Although im 99.9% its not me because no guy has truly loved me.
I feel like its not just that guys are all about looks, i feel like they prefer shitty things in someones personality-not a shitty personality as a whole but just way they believe women shohld behave.
 Like for instance, when i talk to guys i feel like i cant say i enjoy subjects like astronomy and entrepreneurship and ramble about them, I literally feel like i need to at least slightly, not all the way, dumb myself down just a bit and giggle and twirl my hair just a wee bit to attract them-even the smart ones. I know that guys say they want smart women but i really can sense intelligence is not a prime factor is male attraction. In fact its really been the other way around, the male ego is intimidated by intelligence and studies have proven that they are unattracted to intelligence. This doesnt mean im implying that men are attracted to stupidity-just not intelligence that exceeds or is equal to the male's because of the norm of the male dominant-female subservient dynamic of a heterosexual relationship. Same with humour, my morbid sense of humour feels to chill and guyish for men to be attracted to and not prim and proper and I hate it. I know intelligence that is academic isn't super important but for fucks it seems like men are attracted to emotionally stupid girls as well-and I thought emotional intelligence and the ability to feel empathy stronger was always culturally assumed to be a feminime trait-but what I observe id that guys are never into emotionally intelligent empathetic girls but rather very EMOTIONAL women, theres a difference! Im only 16 and I can sense that guys are wannabe hyper-masculine and wannabe chads.

Would you guys be ok dating a guy who got raped?,"Sorry if this post doesn't belong here but most other places would probably just tell me some bullshit like to keep trying or wait to find someone who sees personality. I'm a 19 yo guy who got raped when I was a young kid by a girl and it messed me up so I get really nervous or scared around girls especially if they touch me when I don't expect it and I freeze up. I can tell that girls can tell there is something wrong with me and I try really hard to try to act normal but I've always got rejected and told I'm some variation of ""nice, funny, a good person"" etc but they are down to fuck my friends or most other guys.

So there‚Äôs this possible femcel in my College spanish class that I would definitely be interested in a relationship with. Long Post,"What‚Äôs the perks of being in a relationship with one. Is this a femcel, she‚Äôs like 4‚Äô9 , skinny small nose that bends downwards, hair is pretty uncared for, dry looking, frizzy and messy. Also has a really small bird type face, glasses, weird voice, skinny, autistic? sperg?, hangs with incel crowd (from what I see).

Background: (To explain the reason of my bitterness towards regular women once you see my comment history, plus if you searched far enough you‚Äôd basically find this paragraph again) 

Personally got emotionally raped by ex. Visited my grandmother (who basically raised me) in the hospital, got cheated on in the background, no emotional support from anyone (just got called faggot by my sisters and mother) and no comfort by my then gf. I was just depressed but finally got a mental breakdown when my car got stolen, dog passing away and losing my job two months after my grandmother‚Äôs passing. Ex  left me because ‚ÄúI was too sad‚Äù actual words (sister gave me a heads up she was being ‚Äúoverly friendly with a guy‚Äù and she said she went to stay at his place when I asked where she was...tried to play innocent like nothing happened, I didn‚Äôt believe her.) Even after she told me how I made her feel like the only girl in the world, sang her favorite song after learning it for her birthday...she still did this.

 I can‚Äôt maintain the hookup lifestyle as it‚Äôs just a fa√ßade and I usually slipped up and showed kindness which caused me to be relinquished of respect and attraction by women around me. Usually after hookups I would feel an empty feeling in my chest and checked to see if the girl I hooked up with was awake, if she wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôd just hug her kiss her head and hold her like I would be in a relationship with her to fill the void up which will appear again in time.

I have no choice to pursue relationships.
I am cursed to be the type to be in a relationship and putting my all because it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt change no matter how hard I lie to myself.
I never knew what femcel was or even knew it was a thing until I saw a link in a comment and saw this site. 

Not looking for pity, personally looking to give relationships another shot but with a femcel and to understand what to expect. Like them being autistic or learning how to understand queues since I assume might be different than your average girls.

TL;DR Giving loving relationships a try but with a femcel. Also got emotionally recked by ex which is why you see hate for regular women in comment history (I won‚Äôt take back anything or apologize for it if pointed out). Is this a femcel? (Detail first Paragraph), tips on what are the queues to look for?

I just found out about this place and read the rules so I think this question should be okay. Moid, obviously.

At least society believes you and accomodates you with the makeup and fashion industries to help you become more attractive. Even cosmetic surgery is more acceptable if a woman does it.

Just wanna say upfront, a little bit about myself. 
I grew up really nerdy and ugly in high school, or at least that's what I thought, yet I still had a shit ton of confidence. I asked out the hottest girls in my first year and tried to start stuff with all different girls. Getting rejected blah blah blah. The thing was, girls all talk to one another, so you can't make girls feel special when they know that you've hit on other girls etc. Anyway then I got older, started going clubbing, met an average girl that was an American and we moved in together and I was happy to be with her for the rest of my life but when choosing to stay to finish my apprenticeship or go to America when her Visa ran out, I chose to stay and I've been regretting it ever since. Now a few years later I'm unemployed but trying to turn my life around. For guys being unemployed is more soul crushing than being ugly, but anyway along the way to finally getting over her, there were nine or so young women who I unapologetically used, but I don't know. For years it was like I couldn't go a day without thinking of that first girl and all these things kept reminding me of her and only with her did I ever feel truly alive, but now I'm starting to feel alive again, but I just wanted to talk about the timing thing and talk about where I'm coming from and to thankyou for breaking me out of that Jordan Peterson rabbit hole I had dug myself over the past few months of raging incellleery/Mgtow thingy (not sure what all the terms mean) Anyway, I don't know whether this is the right place to post this, but I needed to vent and I've always found it easier talking to women than men when it comes to my feelings and relationships, especially as my closest friends growing up are still virgins or can't get girlfriends and my dad is a cunt and I wish I had a good role model or whatever. I'm just making excuses, but I don't know what to say or what Im meant to feel except that writing fiction and playing music have always kept me from killing myself or hurting those I love, but somehow, through my laziness or blatant disregard, I have hurt young women with my using them and not wanting to be in a full blown relationship because they were ugly as fuck and so socially awkward they wouldn't know what to do with a date if I gave it to them or were otherwise so dependent on me and so unambitious that there was nothing new or developmental about the relationship, so yeah.

So, like i said... I'm a sub 5. Maybe even sub 4? I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure where i stand. But when i was younger, i was one of the ugly. With time, i just learned how to compensate with lots of makeup and some pushup bras lol. (Considering surgery now)

But anyways... Like i said previously, i do date (usually socially awkward guys or just less attractive dudes i guess) and i thought that finding a looksmatch would give me an actual loving and happy relationship.

**WRONG.**

My current boyfriend said to me he found some cute baby pictures of our cat in his phone and as i was looking at them, i saw his folder/collection of pictures of Stacies. I felt really uncomfortable about it because he said that he didn't have any on his phone anymore. And worst of it: the last ones were downloaded/screenshot yesterday and today. But he hasn't touched me in months?? Im basically his private housekeeper at this point! I fell so fucking stupid.

So yeah: Men are pigs. Whatever you do, never trust them. They will tell you you're ""cute"" but never ""sexy""... And that's because they would rather beat their meat at some Stacy's snapchat story lmao. ",Trufemcels

I ask you all, what now? Even if I were to somehow get into a relationship, I wouldn't be able to live with the fact that my dude would constantly be looking at porn of Stacys and looking at me and wishing I wasn't what I am.

 I think that's at the heart of the pain, tbh: knowing that no matter what, no one will ever love me unconditionally and fully, for who I am. I will never be anyone's first choice.  ",Trufemcels

Ugly in high school,"Any of you had this experience of being ugly in highschool. People always talk shit about me even when I'm near by. People shout things like 'disgusting' and 'gross' when I walk down the halls. I have no friends and only have a few people who take pity on me and talk to me. When that happens people laugh at them while they're walking with me. Literally one time when I was walking with this girl, a guy yelled 'why do you hang out with that thing?'  
People even take pictures of me when they think I'm not looking to send to their friends and make fun of me. 
Even teachers would jump in on the fun. My sophomore English teacher literally called me ugly in front of everyone in the class. He was talking about how beauty involves having a symmetrical face and decent proportions. Then he pointed at me and went ""I see lots of assymetries in your face."" Basically calling me ugly. 
People in general are mean to me and ignore me and walk all over me. Boys ask me out as joke and laugh about it. 
I hate myself.

What is the point of lamenting?,"What I've gleaned from this sub is people here call themselves incels not for being unable to have sex but for not being able to have a marrriage/LTR. What I don't get is the basis of the assumption that good looking girls are all in committed relationship or married. Singles are the majority in the US and many of them are quite attractive, yet they are single. Marriage rate is decreasing all over the world. Men today are reluctant to marry because it's a raw deal for them, many marriages ended up in no-fault divorce leaving the men completely screwed. Also, the manosphere is growing bigger and bigger as I write this which means men can now see through the AF/BB strategy of women.

The days of riding the cock carousel through their 20s and later settling with a beta cuck are coming to an end for women, sooner than they think. Yes, pretty girls have tons of beta orbiters and many of them would marry them if given a chance. But those men are simps and they are ridiculed by men and women alike. Do you want a relationship with such men? I guess not. A man who is not a simp, who makes a decent living, owns a home and well put together in life would agree that it's better to be alone than betabuxing a woman who have been with many guys before. This trend is already visible and I am certain that in next 30 years the number of such guys will only increase, pulling the marriage rate further down.

In terms of short-term relationships and casual sex, yes, there are light-years difference between attractive and not-so attractive women, but in terms of marriage, not that much. There are bucket loads of pretty women in their mid-30s who can't get a guy to say ""I DO."" Does that mean they are incels too? If marriage/LTR is the only thing you want, I don't see any point in assuming that stacy has it better than you. Because they don't.",Trufemcels

The secret solution?,"Hey everyone,

I know that most of you will probably think I'm crazy after reading this, but I'm begging you to at least give it a try. I'm a femcel myself at almost 26, and most of the time, it's fairly bearable since I still live with my parents and at least have some support and emotional connection that way. Anyway, the point is that my appearance is probably the main reason why I'm still a kissless virgin who's never even held hands and I can empathise with every single one of you.

However, and here's where the crazy part comes in, I recently discovered something called subliminals. They're essentially audio files with music that has positive affirmations layered beneath it with the purpose of reaching the subconscious mind and making lasting changes in any area of life you want. Subliminals have become really popular on YouTube lately, and that's where you can find them the most easily. Why am I telling you this? Well, there are pretty much hundreds of subliminals for every single problem that is keeping us from finding a special someone - mental illness, appearance, trauma, etc. I know this sounds too good to be true, but please at least check out  some of the most-viewed videos and look at the comments, and you'll see that lots of people have had true success with them. (however, please avoid a channel called 'Mind Power' - she's one of the very few bad apples)

For example, I've been using a weightloss subliminal for a few days and I've been losing a fricking pound per day! That sounds like it's worth a try, right? I know that this must sound like hokey-pokey to most of you, but I know what it's like to be at your wit's end and to think that all hope is lost - but what if it isn't? This could be the magic solution for us - I really hope it will be.

Lots of love to all of you ‚ô•",Trufemcels
To: Incels. STOP saying you would date your looksmatch or an ugly woman,There are so many posts of malecels lamenting about never being able to have Stacy. You feel like you deserve a natural beauty. You would never be happy with a 2/10. Why are your standards so high? A 5 to you is Gigi Hadid. You wouldn't value someone who was your match or uglier.

"Legit questions, no trolling","I have some genuine questions here.

1. You admit that you could get sex, why do you still call yourself celibate then? Don't tell me being unmarried makes you celibate because [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) defines celibacy as abstinence from sexual relations. Also, more than 40&amp;#37; US adults are unmarried. Are they all celibate then?
2. You complain that men might have sex with you but will never love you. Unironically, Stacy has the same complain. She may get thousands of dicks but most men just want casual sex from her, not long-term relationship. She may bag a modeling contract but you know very well that doesn't lead to marriage. Or she may end up a trophy wife of a wealthy guy; I am sure this is not what most of you want when you think of relationship and marriage. If stacy's life is not fundamentally any different from yours, except the volume of casual sex and validation, why do you lament then?

&gt;  
&gt;Women Going Their Own Way (WGTOW.net) is for women who have no interest in male chivalry, and no interest in being damselled or pedestalized.  
&gt;  
&gt;In place of these inane stereotypes, it‚Äôs time for a *real* movement to transcend them instead of waiting for a [faux movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism) that promised to discard gender assumptions but did little more than [entrench them further](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damsel_in_distress).  
&gt;  
&gt;Women Going Their Own Way can be viewed as a counterpart to the Men Going Their Own Way movement, but it is no mere copy. Self-determined men and women, and the phrase ‚Äògo your own way‚Äô is hundreds of years old, serving as a call to integrity and independence that can‚Äôt be limited to one gender or group.  
&gt;  
&gt;We no longer wish to be held to the ridiculous standard of goddesses, and we don‚Äôt need to be seen as damsels in distress. And we sure as hell don‚Äôt need to be fawned over by chivalric knights and heroes; men can leave their suits of armor and jousting utensils at home. All we ask is to be seen as human beings instead of stereotypes, and even if you won‚Äôt extend that grace, you can rest assured we will be extending it to ourselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stay tuned, more content will be available soon!

Will it help women, especially femcels? What do you think it will achieve?

Ok so although it‚Äôs hard to argue with the core idea that men of any age primary want a hot 20 year old there are some things I think you aren‚Äôt considering.

1. Men will mostly take what they can get
2. It is totally possible to like a girl for who she is and not be too bothered by looks
3. There is a statistical graph by Okcupid going around that shows how the genders rate each other and women were rated on an almost perfect bell curve, compared to men who were almost 100% voted as a 5/10 or lower
4. I saw a thread of incels posting selfies and the discrepancy between their perception and the reality of their looks was kinda mind blowing, like 7/10‚Äôs who thought they were 2/10

First post: finally got a throwaway!,"Hey everyone, I have been commenting and supporting for months on this sub, so I decided to just go ahead get a throwaway account to start making posts since honestly, ya'll have been talking some truth; and I want to be apart of it. ~~without the repercussions of my comment/post history~~

So I have been in complete solidarity with femcel ideas and thoughts for about 2 years. But I myself don't really know where I fall in. I don't have an ugly-looking face, it's just I have an awful body and brain (10+ years of anorexia, BED, EDNOS, Depression, Trichotillomania, Social Anxiety).

In fact, what drove me to femceldom was just my entire experience with male attraction under certain bmi. Coming from my own experience, I stopped receiving positive male attention (compliments and being asked out) at **bmi 18-19**, and any positive male attention whatsoever (talking to me, listening to me, you know...human decency) at **23-24**, and then negative attention began (""fat"" comments, ""she got big and its disgusting"") towards **bmi 26** (also I should mention that below **bmi 16** does negative attention exists but instead in the form of ""too thin"" comments)

&gt;Now I know that my above run on sentence basically summed up over 8 years of trying (or at least wishing) to get into a relationship, but if you want me to elaborate, I wouldn't mind doing so.

I don't really know what to do at this point, besides just getting back to a healthy weight (rn **bmi 24.2****!!)** and accept that I'll be an old maid. Because even when I had a technically nice face and nice body, I was so mentally ill that it rendered the two meaningless. ***Not-to-fucking-mention*** how goddamn hard it is to keep myself at the bmi that is most desired --&gt; **18.5** (at least in my experience)

A genuine question,"Now I just want to start with the fact that I'm not trying to patronise any of you, the answer to this might be obvious but it isn't to me, I am simply curious.

I've never dated anyone besides people from such communities, and I admit, it's hard, people there can be shitty if that's the reason, but there's loyal people there too and I think taking that risk is better than remaining a KV.

[LONG POST] I dated an Incel for 2 years,"Well,  thought I wanted to share some of my experiences with my first  boyfriend, who just happened to be an incel and a 'nice guy'. We were  together for 2 years.

To start things  off, I was a kissless virgin until I was 27 ‚Äì I had other things like  taking care of a dying parent, hobbies, developing skills and going to  college that were much more important to me than finding a relationship.  Note: I'm 'demisexual' so I do not feel visual sexual attraction at all  so this wasn't a problem for me.  I don't drink alcohol, smoke or do  drugs. Those things make no sense to me, so I never partook in the wild  teen scene ‚Äì I was also bullied growing up for wearing glasses and being  a 'hamplanet' with a BMI of 27.

Anyway, I  was feeling lonely because I had no friends in college so I started  messaging a guy here on reddit ‚Äì he was interested about my personality  type and my country (scandinavian) so we talked back and forth. We did  not share pictures. He turned out to be a 22 year old, living with his  parents, not going to school. I originally thought he was much older  because of the way he wrote ‚Äì but as many redditors, he was a pseudo  intellectual who liked to sound smart.

Long story short, he came to my country, moved into my apartment and we started dating. These were some of the experiences:

* I  went to school 	while he stayed home all day ‚Äúworking‚Äù on nothing. When  I came home and was tired, he demanded that I work on new skills  instead of resting. He saw my resting (watching tv, playing vidya) as me  being lazy.
* He  paid no rent or food money because he saw that as a waste of his money  (the money his parents sent him). I supported the two of us on student  loans while he kept ordering gadgets and trash from the internet.
* He  told me that my chosen field was worthless (art/design) and the only  ones that mattered were cooking and sciences (his interests). I almost  dropped out of school because of how shit it made me feel.
* He  told me to stop cooking, and despite never having cooked in his life,  that he was naturally better than me ‚Äì because his country had a richer  food culture than mine.
* He  daily complained about my mother tongue and would show me videos of  other 	languages he thought sounded much better. (No joke. Daily) I felt  empathetic towards him because living here was so 'hard' for him...
* He  said that I was a liar because before he came here I commented that he  was taller than me after he told me his height. He told me he was 5'7 ‚Äì  but actually he was 5'5. I'm 5'6. He measured me quite a few times...
* He'd  constantly tell me that he was seen as less of a man for being short  and even less attractive in womens eyes because he 'looked' like a  muslim and 	was extremely hairy. I'd remind him that I didn't care about  his height or his hairy back, that it didn't mean anything to me (My  father was 5'3 and my mother 5'7... I loved my father dearly and never  saw him as short. He was the strongest man in the world to 	me). But it  wasn't enough that I didn't care and accepted it. He wanted me to be  super sexually attracted to his height and hairyness.
* He  was insanely private. I wasn't allowed to touch his computer or phone ‚Äì  he'd flip out. Meanwhile I opened my apartment, all my things, my  phone, 	computer, everything to him.
* He  told me I wasn't creative which crushed my self-esteem quite a bit. I'd  always  been that creative girl who drew and did art. Instead he saw  himself as a creative genius because he'd modify shit with tape and 	 string.
* He  demanded that I get rid of my cat because he couldn't read him and  because he shedded his fur. I did so and it crushed me. Never again.  Turned out his hairs started being all over the floor instead...
* When  we'd cuddle or lie together, he'd stare at my lips and remind me how  much he wished they were bigger because he was really into big lips and  blowjobs. (I hated them, his dick tasted awful, like mouldy clothes and  urine)
* He  got mad at me for being better at English than him. That it was unfair  because he had put in more effort into learning it. (I had lived in the  UK for 2 years... sorry dude)
* When  he'd ask me if I wanted to do something with him, 'No' was not an  answer. He didn't accept it and even admitted that when he 'asked' it  was only a formality.
* He  put me on a pedestal, saying what a perfect angel I was. How I saved  him from his horrid life and how I was the perfect girlfriend and  perfect wife material. While dictating what things I liked and which I  didn't. He also wished that he had met me later in his life, because he  wanted to be with me forever, but he also wanted to experience other  women.
* We  never had sex. He always wanted to wait for the 'perfect' time but used  me as a 	masturbation device every day instead. And if I didn't feel  like it, he'd get mad and petulant and threaten to leave me. He didn't  like 	me using a dildo because he thought that was basically like  cheating on him. So I wasn't allowed to masturbate.
* He  didn't want me to talk to my best friend (the only friend I have  basically) and my 	family because it annoyed his ears when I talked in  my mother tongue on the phone. He also did not want me to visit them.
* When  I broke up with him, he didn't take it seriously and thought we were  still 	together. He tried groping my breasts and I said no (thats  reserved for my BF in my mind), he'd say 'please don't take this away  from 	me'. He didn't respect my boundaries at all.

I  became a worse, bitter, resentful person with him. Lost all my  self-esteem and almost lost all contact with my best friend and my  family. I was miserable every day, fell into depression. Every time he  hugged me he was sucking the life out of me. I had nothing left to give  and he kept taking regardless.

After  moving away from him, getting on anti-depressants and talking things  through with a therapist, I'm finally back to my original self. I don't  regret the relationship at all because I learnt so many thing from it.  I'd much rather be alone than be with someone so toxic ‚Äì I'm much better  on my own anyway, even if I have a lot to give. If I meet another man, I  will not judge him by the flaws of my ex. That is unfair. But I have  the courage and self awareness to end it much sooner if it turns sour.

**TL;DR:  Being alone is much better and more fulfilling than being in a  relationship for the sake of being in a relationship. Getting a  girlfriend/boyfriend will NOT solve your mental problems if you hate  yourself and is miserable. Do not put that shit on another person.**",Trufemcels

Normie: in a relationship with a normie girl. Gets all the sex, makes no effort to be a good boyfriend, might break up with her to go ""find himself"" (ie. find Stacy).

Sub-normie\*: orbits Stacy, rejects femcels, makes fun of ugly women. Considers himself ""above average"" even though he's never made any sports team, is failing classes, has never had a job and is socially awkward. Thinks Stacy will choose him over her other orbiters and Chad boyfriend.

What Are Some of the Silliest Things You've Done in the Name of Love/To Get or Keep a Partner?,"Back when you had hope that someone could be interested in a person like you (in a relationship, or outside of one), what are some of the things you did to try to get or keep a mate?

I'll start with a couple of entries from my exhaustive archive:

- I once gave someone $3,000 USD to pay off a credit card
- I once sat quietly on the phone while my partner's co-parenting ex cussed me out, simply because I didn't want to offend my partner. Did I mention that the ex was visiting my partner at the time I called?
- I had a partner tell me ""I'm going to cheat on you"", and I still stayed until that partner eventually dumped me. We got back together, the partner told me this again, and dumped me again.
- This was the second partner who had dumped me twice. These two occurred back to back.
- Before I had a car, I begged my friend to drive me to meet with someone on five or six different occasions (pretty much, whenever this person called). It was an hour and a half drive. I got stood up every time we made the drive except the last time. Something always magically came up when I was en route.
- I used some overdue rent money to buy someone shoes to celebrate a birthday.

You guys are correct.

Some of you are hopeless. Yes. You are going to be alone for a while, perhaps get a few cats, masturbate to porn, purchase a dildo, years are going to pass, Stacy will be giving birth to another baby, a girl this time, and you, well, you're going to bake your thousahundreth cake while talking to your cats. By the time of your 40th anniversary, Stacy's son will be graduating in high school and getting ready to college, his dad just gave him a car. When Stacy's family unite to celebrate their younger son's marriage, you will be sitting on the couch watching the last drama tv-show, alone, or perhaps in your aunt's or some relative's house, maybe a nephew comes by, or, doesn't.

Ok, now, people often ask me what i do in life to which i usually answer what i do in my work. It's a lie. What i do is looking. But here's the thing; I am pretty good at that and a good looker knows that you can't just step a foot in there and claim you saw it. Nah. A good looker goes all around the place until he grasps the big picture.

Let's zoom out.

Stacy is gorgeous, skinny, curvy, cute, hot and desirable. Most men don't want to talk to her and don't really respect her because all they can think about is fucking her. Stacy knows that and she is kind of depressed about being treated like this by virtually every motherfucking men she ever meets. Too much love can be boring too, people.

Now, Stacy got married with a guy who's the best possible; Good looking, big dick, professional, good lover and caring, however, after the first year things got bored, but, Stacy still gets all the attention from other men and they're offering all kinds of amazing shit. Stacy eventually cheats. Now, Stacy:

a. Gets divorced.

b. Gets ignored and cheated on back, becoming a couple of ""single people sharing the same life""

c. Gets pregnant from another married man and now is a single mother.

d. Gets nothing, keeps cheating, gets pregnant but husband gives so few fucks and now ignores Stacy to a level where he's not even concerned about getting cheated on or not.

On the other side, because Stacy is cute and perfect and her husband is a match, lots of girls also want him. Now, look at the World we live and do the fucking math.

While you will be in the comfort of your home, Stacy will be being cut in the gut to release a new born that will be incredible annoying, expensive, annoying, time-consuming, annoying, and them he will grow up and get even more annoying, and expensive, then after a few years he'll just leave home and never look back, by this time Stacy will be looking a few years older from raising two children. And, guess what, there's a change they will hate her too. 

So, basically, what Stacy gets for being all that awesome is general envy and natural hatred, sexual objectification, relationship with severe chances of having unfaithfulness and  then you put children on top of that and it gets uglier, lack of respect from other men even when married, objectification from her own husband, possible objectification from EVERY SINGLE MAN she ever comes in contact with, actually. 

Now, Stacy is fucked, my people. What the media don't tell you is that although Stacy is very pretty and works greatly as a symbol of desire to mainly advertise products, she also has a really hard time in all kinds of enviroment, to a level where it could easily get negative. 

No, Stacy doesn't get love for being pretty. She gets what every women always got and always will get; Male sexual desire which is fundamentally generalized, unfiltered, objective and gives no fucks about emotions. The only reason her husband keep up the shit is one and only one; She's hot and he wants to fuck her, that's all. Got fat? Bye Stacy. Got burned? Bye Stacy. Got ugly? Get the fuck out of here, Stacy.

Men want to fuck, men can't love the same way women can, men are superficial regarding sex, women are superficial regarding work, every men want to fuck, if he tells you he doesn't, he's lying not only to you but to himself aswell. 

Now, as i said, men will fuck everything with a hole in it, so, if you want to get laid until your cunt get's swallown and your hole burns, there's not excuse for you not to. And, there's all you are going to get, ever, from anyone. Also, when i say getting laid i mean getting LTR too because if a guy fucked you once he will be willing to fuck again which basically is the same as LTR.

My point is, men are incapable of looking at you without assessing your sexual value, animalistic and irrational as they are.

Make-up Question,"Hello fellow sisters. I apologise for the brand new account, but my incel ex knows my main one.

Anyway, my question to you is how do you view make-up?

Personally, I find make-up a huge waste of time and money. It‚Äôs honestly frightening to me that a womans normal and natural face is unwanted in the public space. The women in my life, mother, grandmother and so on, refuse to leave the house unless they‚Äôve put on their ‚Äúface‚Äù - why? They were born like that, why is it wrong?

The way make-up was made in the first place was to appeal more to men, by signaling sexual availability. Red cheeks and lips simulate arousal, the same with mascara giving the sense of bigger eyes appearing more youthful and innocent.

The image of a ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù attractive woman, in my mind, is one wearing make-up - an image that has been ingrained in my mind from watching people both on tv but also in every day life. 

I‚Äôve seen the argument many times that make-up is highlighting the good features of your face, but when you‚Äôre using 30 products, highlighting and contouring, using fake lashes and lip plumbers, you‚Äôre putting on a mask and not highlighting your features. You are burying them beneath layers of chemicals.

This turned out to be a rant, ouch. I‚Äôve been pressured for years to wear it because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôve obviously let yourself ‚Äúgo‚Äù despite having perfectly good hygienic practices. I refuse to hide my real face, maybe this just makes me a volcel, meh.",Trufemcels
Who's fault is it?,"Society as a whole value pretty people more, even tho at the rational level being prettier guarantees nothing in terms of what is required in a good relationship, by being in a relationship with someone ugly means you are bound to be associated with that person, so, it literally means being less. 

I wonder, is this nature? 

Has hollywood and the whole sexual simbolism presented through media over the years brainwashed us by over estimulating our sexual instincts to a point where we got ""addicted""? In addition, there's porn, is it porn perhaps responsible for over stimulation so that men are always sick for a hotter stacy?

I ask because it seems like many trufemcels have been in relationships or shared intimacy with another person (no, I don't just mean sex; I'm also talking about the hugging, phone calls, etc.). It may not have worked out in the long term, but it is something they got to experience.

Many of the incel KHHVs say that, not only have they never kissed anyone, they have never even had anyone give them a hug, or even say anything that sounded like interest toward them. Are there any trufemcels who are going through this?

My experience with mgtow.,"So this guy i dont even know where the fuck he apeared from . Just started talking to me about my mentall health i was nice to him and actually we had a logical conversation about women being celibate or i thought we did.
So fast forward talking to him he reveals that hes a muslim and he said the reason i was suicial and all the shit that happened to me was because of the fact that i wasnt muslim and that ""shaytan"" possessed me.

Then he goes on to send me his photos which i didnt ask him to do that. He told me to be brutally honest i rated him a 4 with beard and a 6 without it. Then i showed a 10/10 (im my opinion) to him. He said if i was interested in dating chads i said no cause theyre not my looksmatch and women are generally treated better with someone below their looks match. 


He insisted on me converting to islam even tho i had lots of evidence and research that islam is bullshit. He didnt respect my opinion.

Then he continued to say that if i convert to islam hell marry me. I said no.
He publicly supports pedophilia and thinks little girls can get pregnant at 6. 
He said that he liked a lebenese girl who was 9 and had "" big tits and ass"".
 On top of that hes completely insane and supports slavery and violence against women.

one of the biggest reasons you're facing ""felceldom"" is economics! all you have to do is pop over to r/lostgeneration to see how bad shit has gotten for young people these days with the rising cost of everything and the burden of student loans.  in case you don't know, being in a committed relationship is a costly endeavor for both parties but the cost of pursuing such a relationship pretty much falls on the man.  it's the men who are asking women out, buying women gifts and drinks, etc., and any money invested in pursuing a woman is a sunk cost if the woman says no.  

this means that, given the poor economic prospects facing young people, some men are too broke to pursue women altogether, and there are many  more men who are doing fine on their own but  don't otherwise have the economic security to be taken seriously as a marital/long term prospect.  yes it's true that Some of these men become players and just use women for sex and don't have any intention of pursuing anything long term, but many more are just not actively dating, and they're staying home on Friday nights to watch netflix and masturbate after e-paying all the bills, having little left after all the bills are done.  Not saying that all men are affected by this, but you do have to understand that economic conditions have indeed taken a lot of the men who are attractive partners and otherwise would've been your matches and priced them out of the market.

the point of my spiel is that you all should lighten the fuck up and stop being so hard on yourselves.  you don't face the same dating and mating markets that your parents did.  the fact that you're single, in all likelihood, is not your fault and is not the result of any defects.

anyway, just wanted to get this thought out there, feel free, again, to shit on me because i'm a man posting in a womens space, but at least please consider what I wrote before downvoting or messaging me in all caps.  ",Trufemcels

Couldn't Girls Just Pay For a Long-Term Relationship?,"This is in response to the sentiment that it's easy for guys to find sex if they just pay for it, and it should be just as validating as a woman getting laid for free (that is to say, not at all).

Couldn't a woman just pay a man (or woman) to pretend to be in a relationship with you? You pay him a fee and he would use your money to pay for dates, spend time with you, and perform any of the functions you consider vital components of a LTR.

Lots of men are available for this. There are homeless men in your city right now who wouldn't providing this validation for you. Too lowbrow? Maybe a standard down-on-his-luck unemployed guy who wouldn't mind make a little extra money on the side can be your LTR for a season. Plenty of gigolos, players and cheapskates out there, too. Besides, it's not like an incel can go down to McHookers and order a number three with a side of validation, either.

Now, it wouldn't be the same as a man falling in love with you on his own, and he'd likely also be providing LTR services to many other people, but at least you wouldn't be femcel.

Since you won't do that, does it make you volcel? Why not? Many of you say that the incels are volcels if they refuse to pay for sex, right?

The truth about online dating,"So I tried online dating and put effort into my profile (babebux, pictures doing cool stuff, volunteering, animals, etc.). I got very few messages and I got no response from the men I messaged myself. I did reply to all the men who messaged me and it led to a few first dates, but not a second date. But men say ""online dating is so easy for womynz!!! they receive thuzunds of messages!!!"". So what's really going on?

1. **Men swipe right on girls they don't like and choose later.** This is just another expression of men's selfishness and laziness, instead of taking the time to look at profiles, they swipe right on everyone, let the women look at profiles, and then they do their choosing once the task has been narrowed down for them. They game the system to avoid wasting time. If women were as lazy and selfish, everyone would match with everyone and the real filtering would happen in the messages, defeating the purpose of swiping.

https://i.redd.it/ck1x45fxgo511.png

2. **Men are less likely to reply to the messages they receive.** This is especially hypocritical since men loudly complain that women don't reply to their messages. What really happens is that all men send hundreds of messages to the top Stacies, ignore the few messages they get from actually interested women, and then complain that they get no answers.

https://i.redd.it/mfsftsnsio511.png

3. **Men are more biased towards attractive women.** All men will message 8s and over. Some men (very few in comparison) will also message 5s, but keep in mind that men utilize the strategy of ""message everyone something low effort, choose later"", so even if some men message 5s, it's most likely just a throwaway message that they won't follow up on. In the end, men only message women who are above their looksmatch and seldom reply to the women who message them, so femcels are left with no one.

How do femcels view trans?,"Malecel are divided on the trans issue. Some like myself figure anything helps the market. If more dudes become cutey trannies, my dick can't tell the difference and it means less Chads in my way. Even if a woman becomes a trans man (which I've dated before) he means an adorable little twink boi with a boi pussy for me to slam like the space jam but still poses no threat and hurts female hypergamy. In fact the only sexuality that does prove toxic is lesbianism and polymary or however you say ""cuck"" in faggot

The goal should be every man has a woman. Even if you gotta change the definition of what a man or woman is.

But that's my view. Many malecel don't see trans as viable and just normies who couldn't swallow the black pill. True alot of male to female trans are fucking terrible cunts. A lot of female to male trans are just mentally unstable and emotional vampires...but this might be more do to western degeneracy.

A Question For Trufemcels About Self-Fulfilling Prophecy (Malecels Please Weigh In),"TL;DR ‚Äì Question: What sets of circumstances has to occur for you to believe that you could actually be in a long-term relationship? What would make you believe that it's not over?

(quick note: the ‚ÄúIN‚Äù lines refer to something I read an Incel write at some point. The ‚ÄúTR‚Äù lines refer to something I read a Trufemcel write at some point. I'm paraphrasing, not quoting. Good? Let's begin.)

==================================================================
TR: It's over.

IN: It's over. I'm an Incel. This means involuntary celibate. I want to have sex, but no one will willingly have sex with me unless I pay for it (and in some cases, not even then). It is indeed over.

TR: I'm also an Incel. This means that, while I can get sex*, I can't get a long-term relationship.

IN: But I thought involuntary CELIBATE meant...

TR: No, no, no. Anybody can have sex. Who really just wants to be a pump and dump, only to be discarded after the sex is done?

IN: I dream of being some woman's pump and dump so often it's on my vision board...

TR: What I desire is a relationship with someone who cares about me for more than just closing time target practice. However, since I'm not Stacy, guys think I'm invisible.

IN: Hey, wait, I want to be in a loving relationship too. I want to kiss and hug and hold hands and share dreams and fall in love and build a life with someone, but that doesn't even seem theoretically plausible since I'm a hideous darkness beast. I'd gladly settle for getting laid, but I can't even make that happen. Meanwhile, all you have to do is put forth any kind of effort, maybe get involved with social media or something...

TR: Sorry, you're confusing me with Stacy MacRevlon.She gets approached by all you guys for marriage, and when she turns you down, you complain that AWALT, when it's really A.S.P.H.A.L.T. (All Substantially Pulchritudinous Heifers Are Like That), and I'm so invisible that I'm pretty sure a bird crashed into my back last week.

IN: That doesn't sound right. Doesn't the Pig Woman Experiment prove that any girl can get a relationship no matter how she looks? Come on, they designed her picture to look like something that escaped from The Island of Dr. Moreau, and she still got SOOOO many matches...

TR: Fake news. That whole pig woman thing was made up.

IN: Really? Join Tinder or OKCupid then, and see how many matches you get. It'll be more than zero, which is how many I've gotten after a couple hundred tries.

TR: No thanks. The guys online don't really want anything long term. They'd just be settling. As soon as something better comes along, they'd cheat, or they'd resent me for being ugly and leave. Who wants to keep going through that?

IN: Then date me! I'm looking for exactly what you're looking for in a relationship. I will never leave or cheat, because I literally don't have any other options. We don't even have to have sex if you don't want. It doesn't matter either way at this point. I beat my meat so much I'm sure my penis thinks it's a prime suspect and I'm trying to solve a murder. You can just be my girl for as long as you want and do whatever you want. We can solve each other's problems. It will be great.

TR: I don't think so. You're lying. All men are liars. As soon as you get bored you'll dump me and I'll be hurt again.

IN: So wait. You want a relationship, and I want a relationship with you, but you are rejecting me, and that means it's over for...YOU? Well, what about me?

TR: I don't know. How about you go find yourself a Stacy, since that's all men really want anyway?



(* I have yet to hear a trufemcel claim that she can't get laid without paying for it. If she ever did, though, many incels have said that they would gladly have sex with or date any woman for free if she so desired.)

END SCENE
==================================================================

So trufemcels, let me get this straight: You claim to be incels, but you can have sex if you so chose. You don't just want sex, though. You want a relationship. However you can't get a relationship because you're so aesthetically compromised. You could go on Tinder and find plenty of men who claim to want to have a relationship with you (some of you even having been in LTRs in the past), but you won't date them because you think they're just settling or planning to cheat. There are even men who claim that they aren't going to cheat, and they'd be happy just to be with you, but you won't date them EITHER because they're probably lying about that. 

If you want an LTR, but keep turning down all of your opportunities to get an LTR, at what point does it become a self-fulfilling prophecy?

Thank you for your time, attention, and any insight you care to provide the malecel community.

I must say this sub is more realistic and makes meaningful arguments. Most normal people don't understand and some don't care about inceldom. The reason could be privilege blindness.

I will sympathize with incels the day an incel answers yes to all of these questions.,"So my title is mocking u/GodOfUndertale, however my content is serious. The difference between him and I is that I won't go post this on braincels to attention whore.

- Did you go get drunk at parties to observe how other people use lower inhibition to hookup and fall in love while being excluded from hookup and love yourself for 4 years?

- Did you take part in hobbies/activities with lots of people from the other sex, make genuine friendships there, get friendzoned a lot, and take it graciously every time?

- Did you spend about 8 hours a day just talking to people face to face for all of the time you were in school and in college while being nice and not getting into conflicts?

- Did you try dating down, ie. people who look worse than you and do worse than you in everything?

- Did you do romantic gestures?

- Did you try online dating with a good profile (med school, volunteering, travel pictures, dog)?

- Did you try the gender-reserved equivalent of going to an anime convention speed dating event to try to pick up guys?

- Did you try going on a date with an incel set up by a common friend?

- Did you try dating a person from a third world country and try to b-bucks for them?

All of these things are things that I did, on top of being a successful and fit person while I was trying to date. Yet moids will say it was easy because I was a woman. If I did find a date it was because I did all of those things, and I have yet to see an incel who tried all of these.

And here's two more:

- Have you tried being nice to the lowest members of the opposite gender, loving them and offering them what they need and want instead of what you need and want?

- Have you gone months without talking to another human being (including the internet and your mom)?",Trufemcels

I have an idea.,"Hello r/Trufemcels, how are you all doing today?

Being a young male in this place and time with internet access,it's been a while since i first became aware of the existence of pick up artists and the community, later on i found TRP then incels, however, not in a hundred years i would have  guessed that a female clone version of the incels could possibly exist. In my mind, women always had it easier.

I discovered this community a couple of days ago and well, i was obviusly wrong.

Now, when you think about the fact that there is a group directed towards women who are dealing with men related issues while on the opposite side a mirror community of men dealing with woman related issues, couldn't we say they are all in a similar situation?

What if they helped each other?

What if they shared the opposite perspective on things, talked about it, figured it out,  advised each other while getting to know each other in the proccess?

See, most guide on how to be a man is written by men, but men can't really tell how a man is supposed to be in terms of attractiveness because they are not fucking woman. Only woman know what they want, how they want, see what i'm saying?

If men were completely honest with woman and vice-versa, voicing their shit and being truthfull all along, leaving their ego behind and objectively trying to solve things up, maybe things would work out better - perhaps that's the recipee to succesfull relationships, but well, they're not teaching it publicly.

So, what i suggest is a creation of a new sub named r/GendersUnited

Where people are going to pair one-on-one with an opposite sex partner and, throught the internet, they are going to try and help each other to be succesfull in their journey to find love, posting weekly reports about the insights they had and what they learned, also reporting their successes and experiences.

Things should be objective, the final goal is to overcome loneliness, gender-drama and ego-wars will not be tolerated, it should be a place where girls and boys come together to make peace and learn how to love and respect each other, while encouraging and teaching each other how to succeed in real life.

The way I came to realize it was because moids *insisted* there must be one way my boyfriends were better than me (money? no. looks? no. popularity? no.) because they believed women are *always* hypergamous. It made me realized that my boyfriends were worse than me in every single way and that I was therefore severely hypogamous. But don't worry, I only learned about it after my relationships had ended, so it didn't affect the relationships I had.

Moids want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to call hypergamous women unfair, but then when a woman is hypogamous she cannot say it and she must consider it was fair. Moids want female hypogamy to be the unquestionable norm and female hypergamy to be demonized. Moids try to control the narrative to try to ensure they get better partners in the end. And moids are bad judges of hypergamy anyway because they overestimate everything about themselves.

As for me, I dated down in height, fitness, fatness, socioeconomic class, intelligence, academic and professional success, social connections, knowledge, talents, lifestyle, health habits. There are objective ways to measure each of these things. Yet moids will say ""woah you're a terrible person for thinking like that you shouldn't think you're better than others"". But if moids want to call out alleged female hypergamy, I'll call my hypogamy hypogamy.

PS. It's not just me. All the women around me are also hypogamous. The women around me are even hypogamous in terms of salary (they make more than their partner), though that isn't the norm in general. But my mom always made way more than my dad and so did their friends.",Trufemcels
Am I understanding Femcels correctly?,"Hi!

I just want to be sure I get this right: Femcels are women who (involuntarily?) are not involved in a romantic/sexual relationship?

They use a lot of the slang that is often connotated with the incel subculture, such as ""Stacey"", ""Chad"", ""Normie"", etc.?

Also, the women here generally feel ugly?

(I am sorry if I misconceived anything here, I am just curious)

Most importantly, though, do Femcels think that men owe them sex? (Because incels tend to think that about women) From what I gather, sex seems to be a far less prominent discussion point than it is on incel forums.

Anyway, thanks for your help!

More on the analogy between giving casual sex to a man and giving a gift to a woman,"Here's why they are similar:

- Normie women like sex IF the guy is hot OR if they get love and care in return.
- Normie men like buying stuff for women IF the girl is pretty OR if they get sex in return.

- A woman can easily find a guy to have casual sex with if she advertises it.
- A man can easily find a woman to give free stuff to if he advertises it.

- Casual sex is a net loss for women: she gets a bit of fun/intimacy, and she gets a lot of risks.
- Buying dinner for a woman is a net loss for men: he gets a bit of fun/intimacy, and he loses money.

- Trufemcels seems recalcitrant to give casual sex without getting love and care in return.
- Braincels is extremely recalcitrant to give free stuff to women.

They both bring the same amount of ""validation"".

So when men tell you ""you're lucky you can find casual sex"", that's because they imagine that male sexuality is a gift too, but it's not, the sexual market shows that men's sexuality is worthless. In fact, most women have to deflect unwanted male sexuality more than anything else, so don't let men fool you into thinking that a man wanting to sleep with you is somehow valuable. [Men wait longer to have sex with prettier women and are more willing to make the relationship serious.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19485565.2011.615172?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true) Men wanting to sleep with you is not validating, the opposite would be more validating.

I married a femcel. *gasp* we were in college and her amazingly quirky demeanor caught my attention day one we had class togethor. The entire time we were in the lab her and her friend could not stop playing the class clown and enjoying themselves [ It was art school the teachers encouraged eccentrics during labs] long story short to skip the courting story i was to nervous to aproach her myself so i asked her friend for her number. [ friend was a dude and gay so it wasnt me going for the friend and settling for second best] the reason i make this post is not to prove that all men arent evil but to point out the one thing about her that got all of my attention when i wouldnt have paid attention to her otherwise. She did not give a shit about what the world thought as long as her and her friends were having a laugh and bringing beauty into the world through art and enjoyment. Everything she did was always positive and uplifting. No matter how many demons she had inside [ never would have guessed how many there where at first glance but now that we are married i never would have guessed] she was always a beam of positivity for her friends and people around her becuase being happy and making things that make others happy helped her prove her demons wrong that she did have value and she was an amazing person that the world needed.

* Be nicer. Your personality is just rotten and insulting men is getting you nowhere.

* Work out and eat healthy. Complaining about someone not wanting you because you're ""curvy"" or ""thicc"" isn't helping. Besides, you need to do this for yourself. It will help improve your self confidence and improve depression/anxiety.

* Actually put some effort into your social life instead of complaining about how nobody approaches you. Go outside, go to the mall, anything. Just get out of the house. 

* Suck up your pride and approach a man, even if it's just platonic. Make male friends, and don't feel like you're entitled to sex just because you're being nice to them. There is no niceness progress bar that allows you to get laid every time you hit a milestone.

Please can you explain this to me?,"Hello to all!  
I have to make two premises:  
1 - English is not my mother tongue, so I apologize in advance for any errors in my messages;  
2 - here where I live ""incelism"" does not exist. I mean it's a mentality I had never heard of, before using reddit. Obviously  the situations of ""involuntary celibacy"" (masculine and feminine) exist  in equal measure to the rest of the world, but there are no  ""philosophies of life"" in this regard. In  the same way I had never heard of ""red / blue / pink / black pills"", so  it is often difficult for me to understand what is meant when these  words are used.  


Given these premises here is my question, I hope it is not too stupid.  


I was ugly. But REALLY ugly. Let's say a 2/10.  
I do not want to post photos to prove it, but I can assure you that I was just like that, with all the consequences of the case: eating  disorders, personality disorder, self-harm, depression, 10 years of psychotropic drugs (and I go on even now), etc. etc.  
At the age of 31 (two years ago) I underwent maxillofacial surgery and my situation improved, perhaps making me a 6/10. 

Reading your posts I am surprised that, although I was really a monster, I have never been single for long periods. I'm not talking about men willing to use me for sex (of course I've met them), but real relationships. Some longer than others, but still based on a romantic bond, both from me and my partner. I even married before surgery! 

(the marriage ended after the surgery, to be honest, because he betrayed me with a sixteen year old girl... but I do not think this has anything to do with my appearance)  


So my question is: how come I managed to have a love life? Why have men taken me into consideration?   
Maybe it is just a cultural / geographical issue? Since there is no mention of inceldom here, are people less ""stuck"" on these positions?

I'm sure you could find relatively quickly a woman who agrees to those conditions, so what are you waiting for?

Think about it, when a femcel\-caliber woman gives sex to an incel\-caliber man for free, she gets treated poorly (men only act nice towards Stacies), and then she gets told ""you're lucky you're able to find sex, I'm an incel so I can't even find someone to sleep with me"".

The reason malecels can't get sex is because men take and women give. It's easy to find a taker when you have something to give, not so easy to find a giver when you want to take something. If you don't believe that sex is one\-way valuable, just look at the sex industry.

Lowly women *understand* that they have to offer something valuable to even a below\-themselves mate (ie. free sex with no demands), but lowly men *refuse* to even try to offer something valuable and instead make demands (ie. they want sex* an*d commitment from a woman who is at least prettier than them and who is also non\-promiscuous).

Malecels, have you tried giving something *without calculating what you will acquire in return*? Because that's what lowly women do everywhere! You can find people to use you and abuse you too if you offer the correct thing they want (ie. not your thirsty sexuality). And after you get used and get nothing in return, we can also tell you ""you're lucky"" and ""not an incel"".

Mary J Blige (singer) recent divorce fiasco is a great example of how increasing your financial assets as a woman does nothing to secure love or marriage in this society. Men do not love or respect women who have money, assets, intelligence or power or talents. Men respect women with beauty. Period.

#yea we know ""not all men"". but most men, think this way.

&gt;In June, Blige was ordered to pay her estranged husband $30,000 per month in temporary spousal support. When she filed for divorce ‚Äî citing irreconcilable differences ‚Äî the singer had asked to terminate the court‚Äôs ability to award spousal support to Isaacs.

&gt;According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE in May, Blige claimed Isaacs spent more than $420,000 during their marriage on ‚Äútravel charges‚Äù that involved a woman he was having an affair with, not her.

&gt;The singer went on to say that she has long been the only bread-winner in the family and she is burdened with all of the debts, which she claimed total more than $10,000,000.

&gt;While the couple have no children together, Blige, 45, has been a stepmother to Isaacs‚Äô children ‚Äì Briana, Jordan and Nas ‚Äì from a former relationship since they wed in 2003.

&gt;Male Tinder users think they are entitled to use unattractive women however they want, new research has suggested.

&gt;The study found that men often believe that if they go on a date with a¬†woman who is less attractive than depicted in her dating profile, then they ‚Äúhave a licence to use the woman as they see fit‚Äù to compensate for the perceived ‚Äúbreach of trust‚Äù.

I've finally realized why personality matters so much.,"Men view the world through a special lens. Feeeemales who are ugly are simply invisible to guys. I mean invisible in the sense that ugly femcels are more like walking NPCs that aren't really part of her world. 

Every single woman a guy sees and voluntarily interacts with has already passed the bar for attraction. At that point, the only remaining filter is to judge for personality. So from the hemorrmoid point of view, every chick he's ever chosen has been because of his personality (other than the small group of elite 10/10 DILFs who can slay pussy just by asking).

Tinder is an easy way to visualize this. If you've ever seen a guy use tinder you will notice how quickly they swipe right for below average fems. It happens so quickly that it's barely even a conscious decision and I don't think they really comprehend it. All they know is they arrive 30 minutes later with a selection of pussy, and at that point the filter becomes personality. 

On subconscious level, men whittle down a group of 100 women into a group of 20 via looks; the 80-20 rule. Then, on a conscious level, they whittle this 20 down to 10 via personality. 

Thoroughbreds simply aren't aware of the sheer magnitude of women they filter based on looks.",Trufemcels
MGTOW,"MGTOW are men who are fed up with the promiscuousness, ungratefulness, and lack of cognitive dissonance of women. However, what they don't seem to realise is that it's mostly exclusively average to attractive women who might be this way. Because the very bottom percentage of unattractive women have never had a relationship with a man who actually loves them, or even bothers to treat them like he loves them. Unattractive women are and have been deprived of love and intimacy, and they have realised that that is what truly matters to it, because love and emotional connection with another human are actual human desires. That's why unattractive women only want this. They just want an actual loving relationship with a man who loves them and cares about them, and who they love and care for back. Anything else is secondary. Because this is what truly matters to it. They would be forever happy if this true wish of them came true.

Attractive women have gotten love and intimacy, either fake love and intimacy from men, or real love and intimacy from a man who actually loved them. They don't realise the actual value of this, because they have never been deprived of it, and perhaps subconsciously know that they can get it from another man as well. They can ""afford"" to care about wealth and status as well. That's where the statements of MGTOW men come into place, women are unfaithful, ungrateful and don't actually value and/or love their husband. (Crucial note: I'm not saying that it's in the nature of women to be this way, because it's not, both attractive and unattractive women can actually love and value their husband for who he is, and not care about his wealth or status, I'm talking about women who *are* this way, or at least according to MGTOW)

Despite MGTOW men complaining about women being this way, they would rather die alone than lower their standards to be with a (highly) unattractive woman who does actually loves them and values them. This doesn't matter if she's unattractive. Being with an unattractive woman is not an option, they won't be happy that way anyway. As we have already concluded before, men can't be truly happy and satisfied with an unattractive partner, and men would rather die alone than being with an unattractive partner.",Trufemcels

"[Rant] Black pill or Pink pill, truth makes those in power want to destroy you. Biblecel perspective.","Knowing that beauty is power for women and status/money/looks is power for men. We know and believe that there are a lot of people out there that don't want to hear our lamenting. They would go so far as to wish us dead than to offer a shred of sympathy and understanding.

We see it everyday on this sub. Normans dropping in to tell us when and how we can whine and complain. Even on our own corner of the internet we are not safe. The endless platitudes and suggestions from the avg norman. They have little struggle being loved and committed to in this world. It's truly cancerous and astonishing their lack of awareness and empathy. Almost pathological.

Never forget with truth comes persecution. Don't let these fake woke people get in your head and make you feel like you aren't allowed to feel what you feel or think what you think. Don't let any normie contradict something you know as a fact. You lived it. They could never understand something you know first hand.

For my femcels who follow the Bible. Look at Christ. Look at the prophets and apostles. Nobody rolled out the red carpet for them. They lived in fear. Never knowing where their next meal came. Or when they would be persecuted and die a horrible death. Simply due to bringing out the truth of the most high and doing his will.

Wicked people don't want to be confronted with their wickedness. They want to be comfortable, complacent and stagnant in this unjust world where they operate at the upper end of society. Anything outside the status quo will put you at risk. Look at inceltears. They rejoice and find humor in others pain. Everyone has their cross to bear, but they get off on seeing those weaker than them and more beat down by life. They pacify one another into believing this world isn't the problem and instead we are. Gaslighting and projection. Do not let this weaken you, sisters.

Biblecels know, when we are reproached or spoken evil of, it's because you've decided to take on a walk the majority of people have denied. By choosing to follow truth you become a black sheep. These are things that we must glorify in. Through these trials and tribulations it shows who belongs to Christ. Through fire, we are purified. 

It is the same for black/pink pill truth. Refusing to eat the shit this world gives us with a grin, is our glory. We can make a change. We can be examples for the unlovable women in the world, and shine the light on those who are suffering and don't know why... If I never found this sub, I'd still be wasting my time and resources trying to find someone to love me and marry me. Now I put my energy toward things that will actually benefit my life.

Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge

There are many that enter the truth and have no real understanding of what they will need to do to become strong within. We exist at a time at which all the prophets of the past longed to be apart of. And yet we sometimes find ourselves making light of this reality when really it is a blessing. It is the time of our deliverance from the forces of darkness and the coming of Christ. With that time comes great sacrifice and great tribulation on those that wish to stand in the truth. The scriptures are written for our learning and faith comes by hearing the word of God. Let's look at some of the trials of the past so that we may stay charged with faith.

The only truecels are females,"Attractive women have it better than attractive men, because as an attractive woman all you have to do is just be visible to men and they are the ones who will approach you. However, an unattractive woman has it worse than an unattractive man. 

The core primal desire of every man is being with an attractive woman who is able to fullfill his sexual desire and who fulfills his emotional desire of being validated by an attractive woman. This means that the only way a woman can be desirable to a man is by her appearance. However, women don't have this desire, and therefore don't care about appearance as much as men do. Men can be desirable to women through money and status as well. But if a woman is unattractive, she doesn't have anything to compromise and save her like men have. She will never be desired or valued by a man in any way, shape, or form. Let alone having the chance to be loved. 

What gives a woman value, and therefore the most important thing for women, is her appearance, this is the case both for society and for men. If you are ugly as a woman, you have failed your ultimate purpose of attracting a male to reproduce. Ugly women are the most worthless, despised, and failed beings on earth.

So this isn't pure satire anymore...,"When I first joined this sub there was only like 20 members and almost everything posted was low-tier satire shitposting. I joined in on it. I didn‚Äôt do it to insult women or femcels, mostly I wanted to create cognitive dissonance in any male incel dumb enough to not understand obvious satire. Then I stopped visiting this sub for a while because r/tumblrinaction stole my attention. I come back now to find quite high quality shitposting and satire, but also quite a few ACTUAL femcels. I didn‚Äôt expect that to be the case. I doubt my shit-tier posts have ever made anyone feel bad, but if they did, I am genuinely sorry for that.


The truth is, only women can actually be incels. The reason is as simple as how the genders view sex and relationships.¬†¬†Almost every man on earth (myself included) is capable of sex without any emotional attachment whatsoever (Obviously women can too, but men find it almost preferable to not have an emotional connection). Also women (historically) were referred to as ‚ÄúOld Maids‚Äù and were treated poorly by their family because no man wanted them .¬†¬†Most sex workers cater exclusively to men. That‚Äôs because men can buy woman (even if only for 30 minutes) to satisfy his ‚Äúneeds‚Äù. But can a woman hire an attractive male to come over and make her feel like she has actual value in the world? No. Hell I bet most women couldn‚Äôt even pay for an orgasm if they wanted to, regardless of how good or bad she looks, simply because everyone just assumes women can get sex on demand. Which while being kinda/sorta true, is also an extreme exaggeration as no sane woman is gonna sign up for whatever bucket of STD‚Äôs would come along with said hookup. I‚Äôm preaching to the choir at this point I‚Äôm sure.


The reason I‚Äôm posting today is twofold. First, to all trufemcels on this sub, I am sorry for my shitposts and cruelly worded comments. They weren‚Äôt aimed at you in any way. Second, I would like to talk to some of you femcels. Not because I‚Äôm trying to get laid or anything (I‚Äôm bisexual and grindr exists for a reason).¬†¬†It‚Äôs because I think a lot of inceldom (whether in males or females) comes from lacking confidence or love of oneself, or from being socially awkward (autisicel and mentalcels). And I think that by talking to someone we can better understand ourselves and move forward.¬†¬†For example most male incels would cease to be such if they simply treated women like actual people instead of walking sex machines into which guys drop ‚Äúkindness‚Äù coins until they get what they want. Likewise I‚Äôve seen that some femcels have difficulty in talking to and relating with men. So here I am, if you would like a guy to talk to who isn‚Äôt trying to get into your pants, message me. If there is something about ‚Äúhow guys think‚Äù that you would like explained, message me. Hell if you are a femcel and just want someone to vent your frustrations to, message me.

Anyways, I've always wondered, do any of you female currycels get discriminated for your skin tone? I'm really into lighter skinned desi girls, but then I realized how colourist I must be for having that sort of preference. I'm a darker skinned Indian male myself and am constantly worried about being rejected for just being darker, but I'd imagine the pressure must be worse for a gender that's constantly being told that ""fair-skin=beautiful"". And if you do feel like your skin color is a disadvantage, where are you from? Are you from the diaspora (US, UK, Australia) or are you from the motherland?

Aside from skin-tone, are there any other physical features (that are genetically desi) that you feel are a hindrance to you in dating? And would you actually date another desi guy?

‚ÄúJust date an old man sis‚Äù,"Have you heard how 40-something year old men boast with vigor that they exclusively date women under 27 years old? How women their age are so saggy and gross? Then they advise us to go after and marry men much older than us if we are in our early/ mid 20‚Äôs. Or else we will die alone. 

I get English NHK (Japanese public TV) on my TV and there was a documentary about a Japanese woman who married a man much older than her. She was in her 50‚Äôs and her husband was in his late 70‚Äôs. He was sick and old, and had to stop working for 20 years. She had the burden of being a breadwinner for her husband and taking care of him in his old age.

Her daughter also moved in, but she was in her mid 20‚Äôs trying to build her career and was kind and grateful and paid rent and some money to help the family, but she was busy trying to build her own life. 

The man wasn‚Äôt cruel or a jerk either: he was kind and loving and happy his wife was there for him, but he kept having to carry tissues everywhere to cover his ear. I don‚Äôt know what he had but he was old and too sick to work. 

Anyway, why would you willingly sign up for a situation like that? It‚Äôs one thing if you‚Äôre both the same age and your husband falls ill and you become his caregiver, but it‚Äôs much more likely to happen when he‚Äôs old. When you‚Äôre both old, you hopefully have saved up money in retirement to pay for help and hopefully have family to help you. ",Trufemcels

I never claimed to be ""incel"" as involuntary celebate . What i claim to be is femcel. If we were incel then there shouldnt be a different sub for females. Its because our goals are different.
See any female ....any person with a hole can get sex men have very low standards for casual sex as long as they can get hard.
But their standards for dating and marriage is high they refuse to marry sub6 females
Most men just pump and dump females and never get married...or get married in their 40s not with their looks match but with someone younger preferably asian 18 y/o.
You might think whats wrong with that?
See heres the problem ...heres the difference between incels and ""femcels"".
Females are tried of being used and exploited for sex and being dumped for a white stacy.
Most women dont enjoy PIV sex they dont orgasm during sex and its painfull.
Sex is very one_sided.

Males refuse to get married and provide for females and see it as betabuxxing so why should we allow you to use our bodies when youre not going to commit?? 
We dont get to fufill our biological needs(i.e having a family and children)
And when you confront males that youre not doing casual sex they just leave you because there will always be someone that will do it.
I think men are so selfish they dont wanna take responsibilities.
Female sexual liberation dosent benefit us were just going to be abused and exploited.
Even prostitutes get money for sex and you expect females to just give it to you for free.
Thats why you see single mothers... thats why you see leftover women past wall alone in their 40s and 50s... or as you call it ""roasties"".

The Becky or Femcel (depending on the severity of the deformitude) has a rounded or ovular buccal pad. 

I am pondering making two dating profiles, one with triangular buccal pads and one with round buccal pads to test this notion.

My suspicion is that much shoddier behavior will be tolerated from an appearance with triangular buccal pads than rounded buccal pads. Moids will pretty much take anything from Stacey, which is a sign of true love that which we femcels will never achieve.
