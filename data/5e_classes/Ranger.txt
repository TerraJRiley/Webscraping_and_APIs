<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting"> Spellcasting </span></h2>
<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to cast spells.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Slots">Spell Slots</span></h3>
<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</span></h3>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the <a href="/web/20190207025037/https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_Spells" title="Ranger Spells">ranger spell list</a>.
</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spellcasting_Ability">Spellcasting Ability</span></h3>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p><p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p><p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ranger_Archetype"> Ranger Archetype </span></h2>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Primeval_Awareness"> Primeval Awareness </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ability_Score_Improvement"> Ability Score Improvement </span></h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Extra_Attack"> Extra Attack </span></h2>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Land.27s_Stride"> Land's Stride </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 8th level, moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through non-magical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
</p><p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hide_in_Plain_Sight"> Hide in Plain Sight </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt. plants. soot. and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.
</p><p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Vanish"> Vanish </span></h2>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by non-magical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Feral_Senses"> Feral Senses </span></h2>
<p>At 18th level, when you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
</p><p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Foe_Slayer"> Foe Slayer </span></h2>
<p>At 20th level, once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Beast_Master"> Beast Master </span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ranger.27s_Companion">Ranger's Companion</span></h3>
<p>Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
</p><p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one attack yourself and you can command the beast to take an Attack action.
</p><p>While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.
</p><p>Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Exceptional_Training">Exceptional Training</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast's attacks are now considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bestial_Fury">Bestial Fury</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multi-attack action if it has that action.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Share_Spells">Share Spells</span></h3>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hunter.27s_Sense">Hunter's Sense</span></h3>
<p>At 3rd level, as an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.
</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slayer.27s_Prey">Slayer's Prey</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.
</p><p>This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Supernatural_Defense">Supernatural Defense</span></h3>

</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slayer.27s_Counter">Slayer's Counter</span></h3>
<p>At 15th level, if the target of your Slayer's Prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry.
