Yet the basketball in spawn gets a blue post but not a whole bugged character. God are devs are just bad.

From the HotS forums:
The former GM, Tseric, taught us A LOT about what being a Blizzard employee is like and how they are supposed to respond or not respond to certain topics. Let me read you a quote from the community manager himself:

Can't help it.

Posting impassionately, they say you don't care.

Posting nothing, they say you ignore.

Posting with passion, you incite trolls.

Posting fluff, you say nonsense.

Post with what facts you have, they whittle down with rationale.

There is no win.

There is only slow degredation.

Take note. It is the first and only time you'll see someone in my position make that position.

You can be me when I'm gone.

When you can understand how a group of beligerent and angry posters can drive away people from this game with an uncrafted and improvisational campaign of misery and spin-doctoring, then perhaps, you can understand the decisions I make. Until you face mobs of psychology, you will not see my side.

Until you see some bright-eyed player coming onto the forums wanting to know what they should spec as this class, and see them shat on and driven away by petty and selfish people who are simply leveraging for game buffs, you will not understand.

You will not understand until you have to see it daily, for years...

Until you understand that many people will trod over you to get where they're going, or to get what they want.

Until you understand that so many people will agree, completely, 100% with a loud, vulgar and assertive individual, not because he is right, but because he is making a stand against ""the Man""; to take no critical thought in what they say, but simply to hop on board.

Until you actually try to acknowledge those who do not speak on the forums, for whatever reason they have, you will not understand.

If you think an archaic business formula like ""the customer is always right"" works, you fail to understand customers, not a customer. It is a collective. No one person, even myself, is truly above the whole.

I simply have the unfortunate quality of being easily singled out.

So basically Blizzard employees choose to remain silent out of fear of players taking what they say out of context. If a Blizzard employee says ""We plan to fix Kerrigan"" but something pops up and they can't get around to it (which happens often) then the community will blast them apart. Trolls have ruined Blizzard Customer service. They have to be EXTREMELY careful of what they post because people will pick apart what they say, draw unreasonable conclusions, form unrealistic expectations, and riot when said expectations are not met.

There is a reason why 99% of all Blue posts are on silly/satire threads rather than legitimate suggestion/question/criticism threads as there will be little to no backlash on said satire threads. It works out perfectly because Blizzard needs to let the customers know they still are on the forums so in order to do so they kill two birds with one stone by posting on silly threads, thus avoiding backlash while also giving players a false sense that their concerns are being genuinely heard.",10/13/2017 01:02 PM,"{""id"":""207576606355"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207433518685"",""name"":""Skrimiche""}}",post-3,8526 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Skrimiche-1896,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022D1.png,I Found What is More Important Than Fixing Doomfist,2000

Sorry to “generalize” but i’ve never seen 1 Genji Main play a healer. Just saying.


Actually I've seen that once in Comp. I was playing Hanzo (Hanzo Main here) and another was playing Genji. We were solo healing and the healer asked me to switch to another healer even though I was getting picks. I still switched though because I agreed we needed another healer.

After the first round was over the Genji got on the mic and told me to switch back to Hanzo and he will play healer. I was floored as the rest of the team said no to that idea. He told them I was doing work and the team would be better off like that. Every time I was getting kills he made sure the team knew I was doing work.

That was a strange day lol.

"Heyoo.

Overwatch is fun undoubtedly. But I'm finding it hard to improve outside of positioning and aim. Most mechanics are quite easy to pickup and understand and I appreciate that there are some harder to play heroes out there but I feel the game is a bit shallow all in all and there's not enough things for individual players to feel like they're improving at.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I look at other games such as CS:GO and the like and I see people pulling off some really interesting techniques, but Overwatch feels like the same thing over and over again without much sense of improvement.

I might just be a smelly scrub and need to ""git gud"" but I can't be the only one that feels great after carrying a game in other games due to practise and understanding alone?

This leads me to a secondary point, matchmaking.

So, I've gotten pretty angry at OW in the past, due to losing games where people just don't really know what they're doing and you can't really carry in the traditional sense as every team member needs to know what they're doing to win.

So I figured getting a 6-man squad would be the best bet, however I've been told this works out horribly and the matchmaking service ends up putting against players that are at a significantly higher rank than you.

It seems pretty silly, a game so focused on team-play doesn't really work when you're with random people every game, yet when you try to get on a team and work consistently the system screws you over?

As I said before, I feel like I'm just ranting, but I want to enjoy this game however it just feels like a game that I can't improve mechanically, with a matchmaking service not really ideal for Overwatch.

Am I overthinking things or does anyone else feel this way too?",10/13/2017 01:01 PM,"{""id"":""207577107329"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""197374290950"",""name"":""DootLord""}}",post-1,39 posts,,https://us.battle.net/forums/static/images/avatars/overwatch/avatar-overwatch-default.png,How do people feel about overwatch's depth?,2000

IVE GOT THE SOLUTION! If you press the ""Windows button"" + ""+ button"" the magnifying glass opens, and if you put it in 275% you will be able to play the game in something like a 15% RenderScale.

If you think it looks really bad, becouse it does, you can turn the windowed height and width to a higher resolution, BUT YOU have to figure out wich one makes the game be in ""Fullscreen"" with, for example: 225% of zooming in :D

"It seems like the inactivity timer is solely focused on whether or not a character is doing damage.

I often like to play in custom games with head shot-only enabled, such as Widowmaker FFA. The inactivity timer goes off if you don't manage to land a head shot quickly enough, and it completely obscures the player's view. This makes it near impossible to avoid being kicked.

I'm hoping that we'll soon have the option to disable the inactivity timer in our custom games. I personally feel that the timer should only be used outside of custom matches. If someone is inactive, they can be kicked by the owner of the game.

It is her weakness regardless if she is 60 or 80 damage. She has no mobility and no self-saving ultimate like the other healers and that is her weakness.

"""Resurrect as an E ability is too strong.""
""30 seconds to negate a pick is too powerful.""

We have plenty insta-kill abilities and combos that render healing useless on lower cooldowns than 30 seconds:
- Rocket Punch. (4 second CD)
- Hook. (8 second CD)
- Scatter Arrow. (10 second CD)
- Flashbang+FTH/headshot. (10 second CD)
- Hanzo/Widowmaker headshots. (No CD, but charge time is roughly 1-1.5 seconds)
- Charge. (10 second CD)
- Junkrat's primary fire+Concussion Mine. (8 second CD)
- Zenyatta's Orb Volley. (4 seconds to fully charge)


Those aren't even including abilties that can secure a kill, but are open-ended with how they are executed (Sleep Dart, Ice Wall, etc.).

- Defense Matrix. (Useless against Rocket Punch, Charge, situational against sniper headshots and Hook. 9 seconds to charge 2 seconds of protection)
- Projected Barrier. (8 seconds to charge 2 seconds of protection)

"would agree that it's strong if it weren't for the fact I've seen other abilities like this in other FPS games.

Prime example: Battlefield: Bad Company 2

The medic in said game, after reaching a certain level, gets a defibrillator that can be used to revive dead teammates as long as they haven't respawned yet. It doesn't have a cooldown or a limit to how many times you can use it... it's just there.

While I understand these are two entirely different games, it kinda has left me to understand bringing someone back every 30 seconds isn't entirely overpowered.

<span class=""truncated"">...</span> You can certainly waste a rez. Revive an ally in a poor position, and they or you both get killed. Killed while flying in? That's two allies down.

Edit: Not the one who downvoted you. Thanks for being civil.

You can misuse a rez, you cannot waste it. If you use an ability with absolutely nothing happening, thats a waste. If you rez someone and they are behind enemy lines and die again, thats misuse.

Also I didn't downvote you either, this is simply a difference of opinions lol.
Conversely, you cannot misuse half of those offensive abilities in a way that results in your own death. Widow/Hanzo headhots and Scatter arrow can be used from vast distances from their targets, Hook pulls the target (not Roadhog) out of position, Junkrat can only go wrong with his combo if he somehow launches himself into the enemy team with his Mine (which isn't always a bad thing; it's Junkrat), McCree can only go wrong with his Flashbang if he throws it at a deflecting Genji, Zenyatta's Volley doesn't jeopardize him at all.

If you f**k up an offensive ability, no big deal. Wait for the CD to end, and use it again (exceptions being RP and Charge). You f**ck up a rez, and you have reset your ally's respawn timer, killed yourself, and set your rez CD to 20 seconds by the time you respawn.",10/12/2017 01:47 PM,"{""id"":""207576108842"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":10,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207510796317"",""name"":""Titanium""}}",post-13,4515 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Titanium-1686,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000305.png,So I'm seeing a lot of these arguments recently...,2000

When you talk about negating blocking or deflecting these skills, i still think about mercy the EXACT same way, shes a projectile about to hit someone with life, Im a rein main, I gaurd the souls of the dead, and keep an eye on mercy, if you come to res it you are GOING to die.

"Yes some of what you said it true but in context the one hits and Rez aren't equatable in any way that doesn't make Mercy look overpowered. Let's say that Hanzo had the ability to one shot you no matter what every 30 seconds there is nothing you can do you just die. That's the situation Rez puts you in (in battlefield it works because of the high player count) except in reverse an automatic 7-6 if the other side doesn't have a mercy because let's be honest misusing Rez is hard if your teammate is too far forward then leave them and save Rez to make a 6-6 when your better player dies or just fly in and Rez it is quite possible you survive because of her kit especially if you Rez a tank. In regards to the 1 shots do players really get kills that often with them? Especially for zen it's an event if you 1 shot (and it's extremely skill based) McCree needs to be extremely close to 1 shot and doesn't have the great mobility Mercy has and he can still not kill someone. Rein is dead as soon as he misses his charge and that normally loses the team fight right there. Doomfist is the same deal except the longer cooldown is traded for lower health. Junkrat's combo needs to be close for it to be effective and doesn't always result in a kill. As for Widow and Hanzo they are considered troll picks at most levels of play they only get kills from 1 shots or near one shots that's their entire kit. Mercy would be a weaker but still usable support even without Rez.

Sorry for the wall of text.

You can't 'waste' rez because someone will get rezzed regardless.


You can waste rez.

Example 1: the enemy team surrounds and kills your D.Va. You swoop in to rez D.Va. They focus you and D.Va before she can get back into mech. You both die. Rez wasted because you used it at a bad time.

Example 2: The enemy has wiped 4 of your teammates and is focusing on #5. You decide to rez your Roadhog instead of retreating because you are bad. The enemy focuses him and gets 900 points of ult charge before finishing off your team. Complete waste of the ability putting you at a disadvantage for the next fight and staggering your retake.",10/12/2017 02:25 PM,"{""id"":""207577106374"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":9,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207436981987"",""name"":""Lumin""}}",post-23,299 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Lumin-1385,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022CF.png,So I'm seeing a lot of these arguments recently...,2000

two abilities that can prevent them:
Those abilities are not reactionary. You cannot save a hooked ally by throwing down a shield, unless that shield is timed perfectly and is in the perfect position; in which case, it likely wasn't reactionary, just lucky.
Yeah, but none of those heroes have quick mobility skill on a 2 second cooldown either.
No other hero's mobility is limited to a maximum of 5 targets at any given time, which also have minds of their own and like to do their own things.

Doomfist has three mobility abilities, all of which have pretty low cooldowns.
Genji has passive mobility with wall-climb and double-jump. Swift-strike resets on kills/assists.
Tracer literally has a rewind button. In addition, she can store three charges of blink, all of which have decent cooldowns.
Winston has independent mobility on a low cooldown.
Lucio has speed boost and a movement speed potential of 17 meters/second for three seconds.

I'm honestly not sure what you are trying to assert with this statement anyway.

Such a ridiculously low risk ability that can turn a fight into a 7v6 is overpowered. This should never have became an ability. It should have remained an ultimate.

What i suggest would be to swap the current mercy ultimate with res. Her current ultimate will become an ability with a 30 second cooldown. It will last for 5 seconds. Giving her a team healing as well as the ability to fly and move faster and self heals. Her ultimate will change into a one man res ability.

It also takes time being completely still rezzing your ally if i recall correctly.

We have plenty insta-kill abilities and combos that render healing useless on lower cooldowns than 30 seconds:


This is exactly my argument against 30 second rez. All of those abilities you listed can be countered in some way by teamwork or by individual abilities. If your team manages to outplay the enemy team, get through all their defensive abilities, dodge all their damage abilities, get through their shields, cooldowns, positioning, body blocking.... you manage to get through all of that as a team to get one kill.... and then mercy just presses a button and the entire process starts all over again.

Idk Im still unsure about Mercy, on the fence with her.

But its probably because the lack of skill. A Widow HS, or a Hanzo HS that isnt easy to pull off, negated by an E. Sometimes for teams one pick is needed for a push, she negates that. And in general some of these one shots you've listed are just more riskier than Rez.

Its also EXTREMELY forgiving. There are times where people (including me) have over extended and deserved to die, get Rezzed and come back as if nothing even happened.

If that make sense.
I can’t see your profile but I’m gonna guess you don’t play much Mercy. Her rez may be strong but she is absolutely not the brain dead character you and others like to assert she is.... she requires incredible positioning and she needs to be continuously moving and looking out for danger. She needs to have quick enough reaction time to whip out her pistol when needed (as well as your precious ability to aim which I’m pretty sure is all you see as “skill”) as well as the sense of when to put her pistol away and heal her team....

It’s really not Mercy’s fault if you’re playing her like a brain dead character.....

Edit: I want to address how forgiving you think her rez is. Many times she must pay with her life to rez. Therefore you must choose carefully who to rez and time it right so you hopefully don’t die.

Today i was playing mercy on Nepal. Our winston overextended and died next to the door entry of the enemy side. 6 people from the enemy were in front of his corpse and ahead of me. Just to test it out, I flew past all of them. Resed winston and came back without dying. And all of them were diamond or above level players, with decent comp (2 tank,2dps,2 healers). Such a ridiculously low risk ability that can turn a fight into a 7v6 is overpowered. This should never have became an ability. It should have remained an ultimate.

What i suggest would be to swap the current mercy ultimate with res. Her current ultimate will become an ability with a 30 second cooldown. It will last for 5 seconds. Giving her a team healing as well as the ability to fly and move faster and self heals. Her ultimate will change into a one man res ability. They can make her ultimate charge faster to balance it out.


That just sounds like a bad team you were playing against, and you got lucky with it. Everyone wants to shoot the healer, especially the Mercy. If they don't, they really should have. You shouldn't have survived flying into 6 of the enemy team to Rez and the flight back. That's not a testament for skill on Rez, but proof that people aren't shooting Mercy.

and things like ^that happen way too often....and it was the same even pre rework like...last 5x res i got was on anubis point b, we were attacking...i just went behind a pillar to dodge bullets while Zar, Mei and Pharah all wasted their ults at the same time WITHOUT CHECKING where the person who can undo all that was....at least they acknowledged their mistake during POTG cause it showed how close to the battle i was....

tl;dr learn to focus mercy, it's been a year and a half almost, for crying out loud.

side note, maybe a QoL change tho, make Mercy glow when she has res, it would help hear teammates and the enemy team would probably still ignore her lol",10/13/2017 11:37 AM,"{""id"":""207575509227"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207482394950"",""name"":""HAJIMA""}}",post-50,1926 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/HAJIMA-21120,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001A89.png,So I'm seeing a lot of these arguments recently...,2000

All of those abilities aren't guaranteed results. You can easily waste any of those abilities, and all of them require some sort of skill to wield. Mercy Rez once you press E, its done. Thats it. No going back. You can't 'waste' rez because someone will get rezzed regardless.

While I understand these are two entirely different games, it kinda has left me to understand bringing someone back every 30 seconds isn't entirely overpowered.


It's important to remember that bringing down the enemy from thirty-two to thiry-one men is very different from taking a six man team down to five. Battlefield's defib, and revives, work within a completely different system where a single person, or even a squad, is largely insignificant and do not make the same kind of impact a single character does in Overwatch.

She is just useless alone
I'd beg to differ, people just don't know how to play her and who to go after. That doesn't mean she's useless alone. A good soldier is useless alone if he keeps foing after rein and shooting his shield alone but is great against a pharah if he keeps solo-killing her.

"Yeah, there's some validity to this.

The characters with the best mobility in the game can only truly be countered by things that can slow them down. Otherwise, they can always just escape you and you're not really countering them.

Mei and Symmetra have the capability to slow things down, so you'd think they'd be a decent counter. The problem, of course, is that these mobility heroes derive most of their mobility from abilities, not from normal movement speed. And the speed of those abilities is not really affected by Mei or Symmetra's abilities.

The actual best way to slow down a flanker is to prevent them from using their abilities, which is something Sombra can do. So, in a way, she's probably the better flanker counter.

What if they canceled or severely limited mobility abilities?


Simple. Less people use flankers and instead switch to Pharah (Who demolishes both Mei and Symmetra 100%) and Soldier/Cree (who both also demolish Mei and Symmetra but to a more fair degree).

Thats the problem with game balance, fixes arent that simple. ""Fixing"" one problem always creates another, and then you'd have threads asking Mei/Sym to have more range so they dont get destroyed by the above three because their viability gets severely diminished the moment any of the above appear on the field.

Mei would do wonders if she slowed enemies faster so she could actually ""catch"" an enemy genji before he dashes or climbs away


Imagine what she would do the rest of rest of cast then, the hard part with buffing defense heroes is if you buff them to much they just become another flanker


Not much I'd assume. People without mobility can already be cause and so buffing it doesn't make it 'worse' in a way because she's already good against them. If she were to reduce vertical movement and reduce the effectiveness of mobility abilities it would have pretty much no effect on heroes without mobility because the changes don't apply to them.

"And that's fine if people switch to Pharah or Soldier to counter Mei and Symm. The game is supposed to be about switching and counterplay right?

The point is we're supposed to get people who can counter flankers. There are no decent, reliable counters to flankers at this moment. It would be great to have a hero that can hard counter the king and queen flanker heroes so that they would be forced to switch.

Symmetra is not a flanker counter, I dunno what you're smoking BlyZeraz. Tracer just teleports through your turrets and that's that. Genji just climbs over it and finds an alternate route.

Ya, but someone somewhere had a suggestion where freeze works better on smaller heroes than larger ones (like how it takes longer to freeze a larger cut of meat).

It'd be a hell of a lot easier to protect your backline, which is where Symmetra already is, if she took up a support slot. The trade off is that if you have Sym, you lose a healer or a great deal of DPS. If someone switches to counter her and she is no longer effective, she can then switch herself.

That's an interesting take on it. Perhaps, hypothetically, a change to DM's rules would be a way to ""balance"" it without changing any of the characters.

I've opened up 24 loot boxes since the start of this event and the first legendary I get is Firefighter Mei?! Why is this still a thing after so many freaking events?! THIS EVENT ONLY HAS LEGENDARY SKINS! Meaning the amount of time it takes to get ANY skin is even longer than usual because legendary loot takes forever to get. I'm sure my next legendary will be a god awful duplicate that won't give me the right amount of credits that should be applied during events since the skins are 2x the usual cost. This is so discouraging for players that want to earn cosmetics through gameplay. Another thing is why are icon duplicates 15 credits while duplicate voice lines are 5 credits when those actually cost credits?!

"Because event lootboxes are described as ""Contains at least 1 item from the seasonal event"". It doesn't mean which rarity would be an event one.

Edit- You can downvote me all you want, but I'm not wrong
Each Halloween Loot Box contains a combination of up to four cosmetic items and/or in-game credits, including a minimum of one Halloween Terror event item.

I bought Halloween loot last year because I was on vacation unable to play for the first week. Earning skins through gameplay or even paying for them should be more fair. If I paid for loot this event the chances of me even getting 1-2 skins would be unlikely considering how every single skin this year is legendary and I already have all of last years skins.

1.) Add a ""Heal gate for *insert amount of money*"" after each round

Do what I did and just get the console version lol.


I have a big pc with fat graphics and learned to play overwatch as the first fps ever on pc (before i was a cod on ps3 guy). At first i thought, console is better! Then after playing on a good pc for a year i tried overwatch on a console. It's just rubbish, you can't aim for !@#$. It's so bad that the meta on console is focused around mitigating this fact.

To get to my point, i have a lenovo laptop with 16GB ram, a 650m and a decent i7 (so gpu definitely the bottleneck), and it runs overwatch just fine with 1366 / 768 resolution, renderscale on automatic (very important), fps display dependent, everything on low except for textures and anti aliassing (textures on medium and aa on very high, because it makes a massive difference and i notice no impact on graphical performance weirdly enough).

So to conclude, yes it will run buttery smooth on a 650m, if you give your pc enough RAM (rather cheap, just buy some laptop ddr3 ram sticks of 4GB each and check to make sure you don't have applecrap with soldered ram sticks (because you can't change those). And you should be golden.

"Remember a little while ago before the rise of dive meta, defending team has an absolute advantage? Attackers would seen to have a disadvantage due to turrets, choke spam, barriers, etc

Then Blizzard introduced some tweaks to make it more fair for the attacking team; i.e. increasing respawn timer for defenders etc.

Papa Jeff posted an overall statistic about map win rates for defenders and it would seem to favour defenders more. (Aside from Horizon)

So what if, the balancing was done deliberately to indirectly/directly buff offensive heroes to indirectly nerf defense heroes? I mean, mobility heroes are literally the kings of the game now, capable of diving into the strongest choke point and get out (Eichenwalde first point).

Horizon and Junkertown seem to have way more paths to get around.
making a lot harder to defend because you just get surrounded.
but 2cp maps are the worst in my opinion. they all have one main choke you're required to go through (if you have no mobility. if you have mobility their might be one other option), but a bunch of paths right after it.
imagine any 2cp first choke point. there is a doorway immediately past it to the left or right. (Volskaya, Horizon, Hanamura, Anubis)
and every second point is just several paths off to the side that lead onto, or near the point.

Ah yes, I recall they tried that for Eichenwalde first point, by adding a small path in the room.

Supposedly if all heroes are viable for any maps (which is not what pertaining to some heroes' design are meant to be) it'd be great to see more viability.

"Hello blizz & community,

I tried feeding winston a banana when I was on the dorado map and he refused to eat it. Why is this so? Everytime I pointed towards the food, a blue lighting would just come out but he did not eat anything? This confused me quite a bit. I could have assumed you designed this character to be clearly attracted to bananas. Dane cook calls them ""fun-anas"", hah. (No one remembers him)

However, on a serious note. I would like to explain to you why winston needs to eat bananas.

1) It is favorite color.

Look back at the base level suits you have given to him. At least three of the suits are named after scientific terms related to planetary inhabitants; Atmosphere, Forest, and Red Planet.

Yet...the fourth suit had its name changed to ""Banana""? It's quite funny that he would name it after his food. Coincidence? Don't think so.

2) He is always hungry for food. Over 50% of quotes are directly related to eating.

""Feeling drained."", when the enemy zenyatta discords him. His tummy needs food.
""Don't get me angry."", when he uses this voiceline, he needs food or he'll be mad.
""Reengaging."", when the winston gets fragged and respawns. He is desperately seeking to re-engage with his lost food.

...and the most silly one of them all

""My new year's resolutions: Less peanut butter, more... bananas. herp derp.""

3) He is a gorilla.

The gorillian diet typically consists of fruits & vegetables. It is a well known fact that like many primate species, each branch of mammalia has their own bias on what they would prefer to be nibbling on. For winston, it is a banana. I am quite aware of this after searching on what apes like to eat on the website called youtube.

4) Tracer keeps making fun of and bullying him.

A common interaction between both Tracer & Winston yields this hidden voiceline of...
""Oh winston, got your favorite...hehehehe""
""For the last time, no more bananas.""

You can hear in his voicetone that he is upset, sad, and angry about Tracer who keeps bullying his weight. Size of heroes shouldn't matter when playing Overwatch...yet apparently, Tracer finds it disgustingly funny to keep insulting winston on. Devs have said this behavior won't be tolerated so I am awaiting the time when she'll get the ban hammer, hmm?...

...and this takes us to my point, he needs bananas. It's a necessity. I think it would do the community a favor if your development team can possibly add an emote in the future that would make my favorite hero eat his favorite food. It would make his(winston's) day.

"tl dr: Instead of [press E] -> [Get rez] you now have: [Press E] -> [heal the corpse with invisible beam] -> [Get rez].

Right now rez is an instant revive upon pressing E key by mercy. It doesn't take much, if any, skill to perform it, you just press E on a teammate and boom - he's alive! It's nearly uncounterable, and when i say unconterable i mean that it's very hard to prevent rez from happening. The only things that can counter it are a really well timed EMP (a simple hack won't cut it, because it needs time, and you don't really have it when mercy is already flying toward an ally to revive him), a hook, a sleep and a headshot from a hanzo/widowmaker (i have a personal complaint about that, hit registration on her GA is killing me).

Rez is the only ability in game that only can be countered only by an ultimate or by killing her (i include hook/sleep as means to kill her, because if you won't kill her after them, you migh as well don't land those, she'll just GA out). Counter rez with EMP isn't very viable stategy - to waste an ult for countering an E ability, just think about it. All other abilities have other means to prevent them from execution than just killing the user.

So i propose this change: Instead of just pressing E, you now have to press E and heal the corpse to certain amount/percentage of health to revive it. Make corpse damageble, so people can't be revived under focus fire. To balance it out i propose to make rez a silent ability with invisible beam for healing the corpse.

This way mercy has to put a lot more thoughts in her resurrection, and it's how fully counterable.

I suggested this in the mercy mega thread. The mercy mains don’t like it. Although the ideas on PTR were probably going to totally gut res to death.

"Hmm, I was okay with OP's idea until damaging the corpse to prevent rez was mentioned - shooting stationary targets is fairly easy, and with heavy abilities like Soldier's missile it would be too difficult to rez at all.

I'm fine with a cast time outside of her ult, although 3 seconds is a bit too much (2 seconds is already long enough to make it very hard to pull off unless your teammate died in a secure place well away from line of fire). I do think that if this was implemented she should be compensated with either an extra rez-charge when she ults or increased healing/damage boost during ult (it cannot be denied that it would be a pretty heavy nerf compared to how she is live).

As for countering Mercy, hack is a very good counter. I've had enemy Sombras who basically kept me hacked a majority of the game, not only making me unable to rez but also an easy bait for the enemy team in general. I fear the day people realize the potential Sombra has for shutting down Mercy!

Road Hog tends to make my life miserable right now as well, he just stands by the corpse and waits for me to fly in.

I feel their changes have been right place but wrong time. It would have been more interesting to have this type of Mercy go up against insane Zen discord, overbuffed Dva, and one shot Roadhog.

"Hi Guys, background first, I’m a plat player (sometimes I can claw my way into low diamond, but I never stay there long), My friend Reiforek is a gold player, and we have been almost exclusively playing in Quick Play when we duo. I have another friend Sych, hes a Diamond/Master player depending on what account and characters hes focusing on. We play a combo of QP and Comp together (depending on our SR). Sometimes the three of us play QP together.

Now the problem: When Reiforek and I play QP we get matched against rankings that are all over the place. I have seen everything from gold to GM in those games. This range is even more dramatic when Sych is in our group. Which is fine. Even though some of our opponents and teammates are better than us we can still try and fight and make good counter picks and stuff.

What I am not ok with, is when these Master and GM players pick widow. And this isn’t even a widow problem. We can still do well and have fun against a plat widow. But a widow that’s ranks above us forces us to play a different game. We can’t afford to play the objective, because once we turn a corner we get deleted from the game immediately. We can’t try to win scrappy fights because one enemy is far behind the red team, killing us one by one. The only way (that we’ve found) for us to deal with these high level widows is to throw a Winston at her, (usually Reiforek ends up switching after the widow goes to town on us, we call this is Tantrum Monkey). The thing is, the Winston must be single minded in pursuit of the widow, and has to ignore the objective or the team fights, since if she’s ever left alone then our bodies hit the floor. He ends up playing one on one manhunt in a game that should be 6v6 objectives.

Now, if this isn’t frustrating enough, sometimes these master level widow players are pocketed. By Healers. And there’s not much a Winston alone can do about that. He can’t damage through mercy’s heals, or anas, and shell put him to sleep. If it’s a zen then there’s a discord to the face, and tbh we’ve never encountered a lucio pocket, so that’s nice. Not to mention, with Widows grapple cooldown at an 8 second CD and winstons leap at 6 there’s a small window of two seconds to get the widow. You jump a widow, she grapples off, you wait then jump her, and two seconds later she grapples away again. Rinse, Repeat.

TLDR: Master Widow players, at our gold/plat level, don’t really have a good counter. We are forced to stop playing objectives and start playing manhunt. This is unfun. Gold/plat widows at a gold/plat level are fine, we can handle them no problem. I would like to blame the Matchmaker. But we would also like to play the objective, (and not Winston).

"OP's Tantrum Monkey player here. We've considered and tried all the options available and throwing Winston at them with possibly a mercy pocket is the only option that we have and that's the whole point. It's frustrating to constantly have to play one specific character/strat purely because qp matchmaking consistently puts us in a much higher bracket than comp would put us (2300 avg in comp vs 3300ish avg in qp) and therefore we're pigeonholed into playing very specific characters if we want to even survive, let alone thrive, and this issue is compounded to the extreme when widow is involved where I feel the only option is to play Winston, with this primarily being a problem since Widow's grapple buff giving me a window where my dps just cannot kill her, let alone kill her through heals. Often, if I want to play other characters, the best way for me to play the game is to literally spawn camp the widow until she swaps off to (usually) reaper, and then sure maybe my team loses because that Master tier player is a better reaper than I'll ever be on any objective playing character, but at least I'm playing Overwatch again.

Yes, QP matchmaking is hard b/c of hero skill variety, but when I'm a solid gold on a majority of the cast and maybe plat/diamond on a couple of the tanks, why would it even consider matching me with master tier on what seems like a consistent basis? Aren't enough people be playing the game that that just shouldn't happen? The issue rarely happens in say Heroes or League where the same skill differentiation occurs.

QP should be the fun relaxing mode and yet for me, it is a Winston-only mode and if I want to play Overwatch instead of Winstonwatch, I have to play Comp (Nevermind what will happen when Winston inevitably gets nerfed considering how strong he is) and that's the whole point of the thread.

So then I'm left with a few questions. How can QP matchmaking be improved to avoid this? Was Widow's latest buff in the wrong area considering it hasn't really effected her high end usage but has (in my eyes) massively impacted her casual play? What options do I have if I want to say, enjoy junkrat in QP but am consistently against these Widow players who kill me before I even know they're playing Widow? Often I'll predict getting headshot when walking out of spawn at the beginning of the map PURELY because it's quickplay, not because I've actually seen the Widow.

TLDR: I want to enjoy QP as an Overwatch game but because of either matchmaking issues or widowmaker issues, I have to play Monkeywatch; how does this get fixed?",10/13/2017 10:16 AM,"{""id"":""207577706174"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""198893289168"",""name"":""Reiforek""}}",post-9,1 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Reiforek-1375,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000197B.png,QP Widow and Why MMR is unfun,2000

"Hey, let me know what you think about this. But what if cooldowns and ultimate charges remained stationary while you were hacked. This would mean that if a Winston dove in and got immediately hacked, then even after the hack was finished, he would still have to wait for the full cooldown before he could jump again. Of course, Winston with his constant damage and shield shouldn't be getting hacked by Sombra unless she gets the jump on him. So to me this would make Sombra stronger, without making her counters weaker. I also think this change would just read clearer to all and new players. Cooldowns and ult charges are paused while hacked. That makes sense to me.

Even now she's in the Egyptian military to try and follow in her mother's footsteps and to maybe earn the attention she felt she might have been denied as a child.

"Wallriding to be a slippery target was one of the things that made Lucio fun to play. Less than a half a year ago, Lucio recieved a rework that didn't affect his pickrate too much, but still made him engaging and fun to play. And this one change has sent all of that down the drain. To have a ten meter radius, and not be able to wallride to get people in that radius almost ruins Lucio as a character. To make matters even worse, Jeff Kaplan states that no momentum from wallrides was a bug not to be pushed to live, then Geoff Goodman go onto the forums after the Halloween Patch and say that despite the obvious community backlash, are keeping the change, calling a 6 month old feature that was actually mentioned in the patch notes to be a feature a bug/exploit.

I am not saying that hard cannot be done, I am saying that for a difficulty it is far too difficult for the many, many people who play in pups to even complete,

It is not fun, fair, or balanced, to have people try their hardest and repeatedly fail due to this years unfair ""Limited time"" event expert mode from last year being this years hard mode,

It is not fun to be playing a bunch of glass cannon marksmen, in random pubs with normal players against stupidly high HP bosses, plus the addition of an untested new boss this year, We are not 360 no-scope pro players, we just play for a good time.

Endless mode is not much easier either, the only reason that we can't play all the heroes in endless mode is because Blizzard only had a finite amount of audio recordings set up for the ""Contessa, Swordsman, Archer, Alchemist"" and so on themes, and none for the obvious picks like Bastion, Lucio, and Lei-Mei.

Overall I am disappointed in Blizzards habit of unleashing unbalanced, Limited time events with special rewards that you will not be able to earn until the next year when it cycles.

Two interrupts, two heals, one extra damage that is ignored by everyone but the elites, extra health packs

Having the torb turret up, the the right of the top left spawn door seems to help a lot. Doesn't seem to get targetted much and helps a lot against both junk spawn and sym spawn. When sym spawns, she will go for turret and ignore you as you heal it. Since her gun does flat damage, pretty easy.

I got all the achievements last year, beat all the modes and got the first not a scratch achievement. If I really cared I would grind for the achievements this year and could probably get them with enough time, but I stopped going for 100% achievement completion around Uprising in favor of doing almost anything else and currently Fortnite and my SNES classic are eating up my attention. Going for full completion on a mode I spent hours on last year isn't an interesting enough goal for me to be as dedicated.

But even being able to complete the event on hard last year, when it was closer to expert difficulty, I'm still silver.

To be fair, Hard is supposed to be one of the easier difficulties. But the difficulty is ratched up enough that small mistakes can break a game for anyone plat and below. They could have reserved legendary as the mode that required high skill and a cooperative team. It's the way uprising worked.

As it is plenty of gold and platinum players, which are the majority of the playerbase, find Normal too mindless but Hard too difficult. As a result the ones that do know how to beat it get frustrated because the average ones cannot and they get losses because they aren't good enough to carry either.

Normal could be for bronze/silver, hard for gold/plat, and expert and legendary should be for the players that are above average.

OTOH, it is also completely doable with a team of golds that have a decent strategy. I've beat it that way. So maybe that was the idea behind the difficulties?

"I'm not usually one to complain about things, but this is the one thing that I just don't understand, and I'm really hoping I'm not alone in feeling this way.

There's currently only 5 modes in arcade, while the icons for them are unnecessarily HUGE. Why not just make the icons smaller, and keep modes like team deathmatch/1v1, which were supposed to be permanent game additions in the first place?

Something like this: https://i.imgur.com/ry1IFf7.png

I played TDM a lot, and it sucks that we can't play it for at least 3 weeks now, assuming it comes back after the event. And no limits has been gone for over half a year now, with plenty people constantly telling blizzard how much they want it back, but we never hear anything about it..

That's a good point, but to be honest, seeing how popular Overwatch is at the moment, I don't think queue times would be a problem for a long time. And the reason it takes longer to find players for a custom match is because you get lootbox bonuses in arcade, and custom matches are unreliable with people not caring about the games and leaving constantly. I can't play a custom game without players leaving and joining every 10 seconds.

Team deathmatch was extremely popular, I always found games for it within 10 seconds of queuing, so I highly doubt popularity played a role in its removal.",10/13/2017 09:27 AM,"{""id"":""207577405709"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207438507868"",""name"":""Loki""}}",post-4,89 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Loki-27293,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000197B.png,Why remove arcade modes instead of making the icons smaller?,2001

I have a really good thing to say about overwatch.

If you are banned Blizzard will literally refuse to tell you why.


You sure you didn't just not look? Thought if you directly contacted them, they were obligated to tell you.

"Hey buddy

I think it's something along these lines:

1. The live game must not be linked to the forums when new content (e.g player icons) are added to the game. Maybe someone actually has to manually add them into the forums? (my guess anyway). Or perhaps there is an intentional delay on them appearing in the forums in case there are bugs in the live game that they don't want to mess up the icons on the forum? I really have no idea.

2. I think the dance and sit emotes are coded to run for as long as you don't press any buttons... Although it might be a glitch when they end prematurely? Other than that, you might be knocking a button accidentally ;) Or a team mate may have nudged you (that sometimes takes me out of sitting)

3. My guess is that Blizz has programmed it so that we don't have overlapping voicelines when multiple team mates use theirs... That would get really annoying and confusing if you have 3 or 4 (or 6!) players all using their voicelines at one time and all of them being heard!

"Opened around ten boxes already, only got McCree's skin. Just got my second legendary in my last box. It's a regular Symmetra skin I don't even !@#$ing like.

I really hate that Blizzard insists on keeping regular legendaries in event boxes. It's hard enough to get these skins as it is, and legendaries are rare. It's really frustrating when your legendary drop is wasted on a non-event item.

like Reinhardts and Orisas should be subtracted from her accumulated healing total at the end of the match statistics. This would be an excellent solution to the problem of undeserving Mercy one-tricks climbing the ranks. The system would see the Mercy's poor statistical performance and grant her limited SR gains. Tactically aware Mercys who know how to spread the heals around to not only the safe options but also to critically wounded squishies would be less impacted by the change and would continue to climb. This would be a way to penalize Mercys who farm easy, stationary heals.

Healing the tanks is more important then healing the dps. The dps have higher mobility, so they can grab health packs easier.

The tanks are making space, they are not in a position to leave...

Not farming, just healing. Damage boost gives more sr.

Rezing the dead tanks gives more sr. Shooting people gives more sr.

They are not farming sr, they are just helping you to win the game.

Farming sr looks different.",10/12/2017 08:34 AM,"{""id"":""207576804710"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":12,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207479975360"",""name"":""RobotWizard""}}",post-13,1910 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/RobotWizard-116887,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000022D1.png,Healing done by Mercys to targets,2001

"The rule for healing (as any support) is if there is a half health tank and a half health squishy it's best to heal the squishy first because the tank, even with half HP, still has more health than the other. I don't know why anyone would choose to heal the hero with more health first and allow the lower health ally die. The only time I favor healing tanks if they are closer to me and the squishy person decided that jumping into the middle of the enemy team with 250 HP was a smart idea. By the time it takes me to fly over to them they're usually already dead and then I die right after from the same people. If you're not getting healed then chances are you put yourself in a bad position that the healer can't save you from or risk themselves in the process to heal you. Example Genji/Tracer on the other side of the map with no LOS spamming ""I need healing."", critical health, and deciding to still fight instead of getting a health pack or running away, resulting in them dying.

No, I don't. I see an injured tank, I heal them... Because if they die, the rest of the team isn't far behind.


So you admit to farming heals?


Farming. Heals. What?

"If I have multiple people on crit health, I at least touch up the dps but of course I'm healing the tank. The one stopping us all getting hit by things that kill us. The one taking the most damage. That guy. Also DPS have far superior mobility to tanks? They can get out and find health packs. Half the time if I can at least tap a second on a genji, they're gone to that big health pack and are back killing things in a split second. No tank other than D.Va has that ability to disengage quickly and effectively to go into rooms for those. They're too big and the second they turn their backs they're a huge target.

Especially on things like CP maps, having the tank alive and healthy is a surefire way to ensure that the rest of the team has the time to run back to contest tbh

It's not farming, farming is that pharah shooting herself for 5min so that Mercy can get an ult build. I hate those guys. Healing the tank is literally just doing your job. Your job is to heal the person in front of you. Sorry babe but i'm not able to fly to the widow too far back on the ledge and out of my fly target, or the tracer in the building waving at me like I can dodge the entire enemy team and walk around the corner to heal her zippy !@#.

You're right, healing from behind a corner or behind a Rein barrier shouldn't be allowed, real healers should push through the Rein barrier like you do as a DPS'er, that way we're 2 people who can REEEEEEEEEEE at The REEEEEEEEEEEinhardt for not keeping us alive as we suicide into the enemy lines.

Defence is about area denial.
Offence is about straight up DPS/killing.

McCree doesn't have anything in his kit that can be used for area denial (except of course his ultimate) he does however posses a powerful means of eliminating most of the roster.

"...information on our profiles showing the characters you have the most time invested in? It's not too bad for me because since I main DPS like probably 99.5% of the Overwatch community, people don't really mind if I grab a DPS, Tank or Heal. But man are you screwed if you have the audacity to pick a DPS if you have most of your time spent on a Support character. The amount of times I see this happen in competitive, someone perving someone's profile and see this person's time spent on certain characters and automatically tell them ""Hey! You can't play Soldier or Genji! Play Mercy! or Ana! or this! or that!"".

This issue happens extremely often and in competitive, it takes one person, one idiot to break a game. So, if this person doesn't like who you're playing, he just might decide to throw. This happened several times where they either got toxic about the situation and screwed the game for everyone else... or simply just threw.

This game enables this behavior. This game enables toxicity. Blizzard can blame the community all they want. There's a little bit of truth in that but it starts off with these little things in-game that do not help what so ever. What's the reasoning behind showing a person who you play the most with other then get !@#$ on because that one guy doesn't like the fact that you're playing anything else but the one character you have the most hours on?

You're supposed to be playing to win in comp, not playing who you want to.

If you have the most experience in one type of character and hardly any in another, picking the one where you have hardly any experience is tantamount to throwing.


Or they practiced in quickplay and now want to play that character in comp because they feel it will give them a better chance at climbing, which automatically involves winning.

If they practiced ENOUGH in quickplay then they wouldn't qualify as having ""hardly any experience"" as I stated.
I'm aware some people will !@#$% at someone if they have 50 hours on one character and 15 on another and they pick the 15, but as long as you have at least 10 hours on whatever character you're playing I won't say anything (unless you aren't getting the results that the character you picked should be).",10/13/2017 08:27 AM,"{""id"":""207577306223"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207410110100"",""name"":""Scynt""}}",post-6,1124 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/ScyntWhitestripe,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000015A3.png,Why keep...,2001

"These are very similar to the complaints about Genji. Let's say you take away one of the grenades making him basically the same as he was before. He will still get those trap mine combos, still gonna get the left click mine combo, and can STILL do it every 8 seconds. The only difference now is that he has more flexibility with the mine. Yes he is stronger, yes you will see him more often, no that doesn't make him OP. Can minor tweaks be made? Yes. Every single hero in the game can be argued to 'deserve' minor tweaks to buff or nerf them and I don't think those discussions shouldn't be made about any hero but Junkrat is very close to balanced (I hold the opinion nothing is 'perfectly' balanced unless it's the tool to balance everything else around since in that case that hero would be the perfect balance they're seeking to achieve) right now so any change should be very minor. I could see a slightly longer cooldown on his mine (not a huge fan of this) or an increase to his ult charge. I don't think changing these things in a minor way would make him any less viable than he is right now but I also don't think he necessarily needs those changes.

The problem with a lot of the changes proposed on these forums:

Mine damage
If you change mine damage you mess with the trap mine combo on 200hp heroes which is something that's supposed to happen. Use your spacial awareness and look for the spikes poking out of the map to counter it. If his mine damage is reduced his trap damage has to be increased and guess what people would end up complaining about? You 'fix' one problem and create another.

'Cheap' shots and spam
The biggest complaint I see about Junkrat is the 'no skill' kills. While direct hitting with him DOES take a fair bit of skill it can feel really cheap to get killed by a stray grenade. To counter this without a nerf you could try push through different spots or run heroes who can kill him at a distance (think Pharah for distance) before you make a big push which means you be careful before he dies. Or you could run a LOT of shields and a Zarya which means Junk will basically end up spamming shields the entire game if you're cycling them well. Basically give your team enough cover to kill him before the shields come down.

A nerf that he could see is some form of damage drop off for his left click. That means he can't rain down long range fire but can still get reach with his mine (the mine sniping is balanced because the knockback means there will almost never be any followup by Junk if he's sniping with it even if he has no drop off damage). This means it's less punishing to try and push into an area getting spammed but isn't that Junk's entire design point? Area denial is his thing. Personally I'm not a fan of this.

Ult charge nerf is reasonable but again I'm not sure if it's necessary. It wouldn't make him trash tier and could be done in a way that's minor enough which is good because he is in a pretty good place right now.",10/13/2017 07:01 AM,"{""id"":""207577706109"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":6},""author"":{""id"":""194945587740"",""name"":""BowDOS""}}",post-6,99 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/BowDOS-1920,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001150.png,Junkrat is out of control,2001

As a Genji Main, yes I hate spam but I just deal with it. I don't think he is OP.

Mei can't stop flankers because their movement abilities are not effected by her slows.

Torb cannot set up if his turret after it has died even if it takes longrange D.va pokes. (missiles make it even worse.) He's especially bad on the payload part of maps. He sets up, then even if it doesn't die it can quickly be in the wrong position because the spot he's defending has moved.

Bastion has the damage to deal with tanks and flankers, but does not have the ability to effectively deal this damage. Ironclad made him tankier, he does not need that. What he needs is old sentry.

Ah it's that time of the month again.

The new system is designed to significantly lower your chances of getting duplicates.
That's it.
It doesn't increase the odds of getting rarer items. It doesn't lower it. It stays exactly the same. All that's changed is that the odds of you getting something you already have is drastically lowered.

That said, Event Lootboxes actually increase your odds of getting a Legendary, because event items are calculated on a different drop table.
What that means is you have lets say 5% chance of getting a normal, not event legendary, and a 5% change of getting an event legendary.
Meaning you have an overall doubled chance of getting a legendary.
Event drop item rates don't share with non-event items.

It doesn't only apply to commons and uncommons. This applies to all rarities: If you have it already, the odds of you getting it again are drastically lowered if there is still stuff you don't have. The more stuff you have, the lower these odds get.

I have basically every non-event spray and voiceline at this point.
The first 20 chests I opened contained almost entirely event sprays and voicelines (I got a few player icons and credit drops), and it wasn't until I was in the mid 20s that I got my first duplicate, because at that point I had cracked almost every new spray and voicelines.

But, as always.

But, as always.

So... you're getting less currency from duplicates and still getting legendaries at legendary drop rates?

Ah it's that time of the month again.

The new system is designed to significantly lower your chances of getting duplicates.
That's it.
It doesn't increase the odds of getting rarer items. It doesn't lower it. It stays exactly the same. All that's changed is that the odds of you getting something you already have is drastically lowered.

That said, Event Lootboxes actually increase your odds of getting a Legendary, because event items are calculated on a different drop table.
What that means is you have lets say 5% chance of getting a normal, not event legendary, and a 5% change of getting an event legendary.
Meaning you have an overall doubled chance of getting a legendary.
Event drop item rates don't share with non-event items.

It doesn't only apply to commons and uncommons. This applies to all rarities: If you have it already, the odds of you getting it again are drastically lowered if there is still stuff you don't have. The more stuff you have, the lower these odds get.

I have basically every non-event spray and voiceline at this point.

I'm getting the same amount of currency I got previously, just not from duplicates. I'm getting them from Credit Drop, as I mentioned.
Spray and voicelines only get me 5 credits a duplicate, which is what most people get.
I would need 10 duplicates to equal 50 credits. So 2 and a half loot boxes with no new content.
Or with the new system I can open 9 new items, and get 1 rare loot credit drop. Meaning that now not only is there 9 less items I need to buy, but I still have the same amount of credits towards a new item.

Same logic applies for legendarys. Yes there are more of them, but with each one that I get that isn't the one I want, my odds of getting the one I want increase, meaning less chests I need to buy.

The old system didn't care about what you had. You could open 1 box or open 100 boxes and still have the same odds of getting the legendary you want.
The new system does care about what you have. It's exponential. Meaning that the more you open, the more likely you are to get the item you want, so you don't need to get as many.",10/13/2017 04:29 AM,"{""id"":""207576408831"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207410913107"",""name"":""NooneSpecial""}}",post-15,3695 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/NooneSpecial-6649,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001159.png,Only Me?,2001

Expect for the fact it's totally silent and you have no way of knowing the enemy team can see your position and anticipate which routes you're going to take, know the exact location of your healers so their flankers can rush in and take care of them etc. I understand that it's smaller than widows ult but that's no excuse to make it so the enemy team has no way of knowing it's active.
Imagine if Widow had the ability to create a smaller version of hanzo's ultimate every 20 seconds but when she did it it was completely silent, so unbeknownst to you you were about to turn a corner and be ravaged by twin dragons that you weren't anticipating.

Skipping over the fact that Hanzo gets a smaller version of Widow's ult every 20 seconds, what annoys me about it is why does Hanzo deserve to have a mini wall hack that he doesn't announce to the enemy team while Widow shouts hers at the top of her voice?

I'm not saying remove Widows vocal cue because I think everyone would like to know when they're about to turn a corner and the enemy Widow is waiting to headshot them.
I do however think we need some sort of indication when the enemy Hanzo uses his sonic arrow given how powerful a wall hack is.

So what about if when Hanzo and his team can see you through the wall you get 'DETECTED' on your screen like how it currently is for Sombra when she's invisible and the enemy Hanzo/ Widow have spotted her.
Hanzo's wall vision is better than Infra Sight in terms of usage frequency, but Infra Sight is better in terms of pretty much everything else.

For starters, the actual effect of Hanzo's wall vision is much more limited than Infra Sight is. It detects enemies in a set radius and lasts for 10 seconds. Compare this to Infra Sight which lasts for 15 seconds and has indefinite range. So Infra Sight is better just as an ability.

More importantly, Hanzo doesn't gain as much benefit from wall vision as Widowmaker does. Since he fires arrows with a set movement speed, his zoning relies much more on pressuring enemies rather than reacting when the opponents come out of cover. Meanwhile, Widowmaker is the opposite. Her pressure is certainly very strong as well, but she relies much more on waiting for the right moment to shoot than Hanzo does.

Hanzo himself gains a decent advantage from wall vision when it comes to doing his job at zoning opponents, but it's not as strong as it seems since he can pressure enemies even if they're behind cover and can't strike peekers very well. Widowmaker however gains a critical advantage if she can see her opponents behind walls. She obviously knows where they are, but it greatly increases her pressure power since she can't do much by firing in the general direction of enemies taking cover, and since she can kill peekers much more easily. She has better picking power than Hanzo does, and her Infra Soght vastly improves both this picking power and her pressure power.

They're both about the same strength as supportive abilities (i.e. how well your allies can take advantage of them), but the way that they benefit the respective heroes is vastly different.",08/02/2017 10:44 PM,"{""id"":""207568579052"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207430976117"",""name"":""sopkah""}}",post-13,254 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/sopkah-1871,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000002F7.png,Widow ult vs sonic arrow,2001

"I've recently become more active on the forums, and one argument that never fails to get me slightly irritated is that ""x ability should be in the game because that's what makes sense"" or ""x interaction should happen because (real world stuff)"". Things like, ""genji shouldn't be able to deflect rein's hammer because it's big"" or ""ana should be able to heal herself by sticking a dart in her arm"" always strike me as being beyond the point.

Everything in the game is for the sake of balance, not because it makes sense IRL. Let's look at some examples of real life logic applied to Overwatch:

Headshots instakill: Pretty much everything in OW that can headshot would instakill you IRL.

Junkrat's grenades instakill: Pretty sure you're not gonna be walking away from a grenade literally exploding on you.

Everything that's a direct hit essentially removes you from the game: You're probably not going to be ready to fight a war after an arrow goes through your ribcage, or after a literal rocket hitting you directly, or after a pile of scrap is blasted into your face.

Mercy can't rez: I've never heard of anyone being brought back from the dead before.

No respawns: Same idea as mercy rez.

Heroes can pick up other hero's weapons: You know, that's a pretty nice assault rifle you got there, I'll just pick that up and fly around with it as pharah.

Payloads would never move: How do heroes move a payload just by standing close to it?

i personaly find it amusing...when it is done as blattant humorless jokes, it is however tedius to deal with people who actually believe they can make game balancing arguments using this type of thing.

Love the event but I wish they had a mode where achieves are disabled and you can play any hero (I'm fine with not all heroes having specific voice lines) you want. Sure you can go to a custom game mode but it's a lot more streamlined to have it as an actual mode. Maybe make it so that you click on either normal or endless mode and then you get an option for all heroes or limited like we have now. That's what would have made the event perfect for me.

I LOVE Overwatch and the entire team, but overall this event was a letdown.

I expected that they were going to rework/upgrade the brawl and make it even better.. instead they booted up last year's, shoehorned in Symmetra (with her fantastic new skin) and called it a day.

OH wait, they added an endless mode, which, lets be real, is basically just a sliiiightly remixed version of last years brawl, with the exact same spawns, just more of them.

"There are only 2 ways an Overwatch 2 comes out:

1) Graphics advance far enough that the devs feel the game looks really sub-par and dated and decide to overhaul the entire graphical engine.

2) The game completely dies and no one plays it anymore so the devs start on an Overwatch 2 to try and get a resurgence from the player-base.

There is no in-game story to seperate releases, and the game is so barebones that there is nothing that can't be added to it via patches.

I give this game 10 years max before it dies (if Bliz turns it around from where its heading and actually creates a happy playerbase). I give it 3-4 years before dying on consoles.

Just a friendly reminder to all those who are unaware, but Junkrat can actually headshot. It happens when his projectile explodes near or above the center of your character's head, which in turn usually leads to a ""one shot, one kill""—depending on how many you fired. And, this can actually kill a 400 HP hero in Total Mayhem. It doesn't happen often, given the projectile curve and whatnot, but it is still possible.

So before you accuse anyone of hacking from being a one-shot kill (do especially check if you're a 400 HP hero), they might have just gotten lucky and headshotted you, as Junkrat.

""Iniciando el hackeo.""


Okay... so except if blizzard made an update overnight, this is the biggest lie I've ever heard of....
Pharah as well as Junkrat have been thouroughly tested by me in training mode. The bots do not move... I have tried from all angles: a ball falling from the sky right on the head, a straight shot at the head, even tested with the mine: it is not true.

You do have direct hit damage and aoe damage though depending how far away you've been from the explosion.

So either you just burned yourself by trying to lie your way out of cheating, or the dude who accused you didn't realize he actually got two shots in his face.

But don't spread lies like that, or even if it were true, something like this needs to be proven eith a video.",10/13/2017 08:01 AM,"{""id"":""207576109782"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207433781348"",""name"":""Rohkah""}}",post-5,812 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/psn/Rocca24_7,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x02500000000010BB.png,Salty,2001

"How did Blizzard miss this opportunity? 1. It could have been demon symmetra with a portal to hell.
2. Zarya would have been Waaaaay better suited for a Dragon skin.
Firstly, Zarya dosent have any really amazing skins (IMO this statement includes the new 80's one. Its good but not like oni-genji or dragon symmetra good, its about as good as her power ranger one (IMO))
Secondly, Her gun would have shot dragon fire. (It couldpossibly change the flame color from orange to blue as charge built)
-- Her self shield and ally shield could have been balls of Dragon Fire.
-- Can you not imagine Zarya in scaled battle armor?
--Symmetra just got the amazing oasis skin, and the dragon looks alright on her but IMO Zarya neeed it more and would have put it to better use.

Generally no. If someone is dead set on doing something then you can't change it. The only thing you can do is try your absolute hardest to still win in spite of that. So instead of 'proving' your point because you disliked how the person was playing that hero you take it upon yourself to pick up the slack in every way you can. At least that's the mentality I have for comp. QP is pretty much the only place I get to play Mei now (too many people want to play DPS so I just go tank) so all I do is pick her and enjoy myself even if there's something 'better' I could do. I still do everything I can to win but that's the place where I try new wall spots or just have fun ( meaning you don't have to go with the most 'optimal' setup but still emphasis on trying to win though).

So, I can't play differently then? Why was I throwing and not the other guy, because I was proving a point to someone? That's hypocritical. The guy was a level 90, playing very odd, like he let his 6 year old play or something. How can I pick up his slack as mercy? The team was dying because he didn't want to be on the point.

It's just a qp, play like you want and let others do the same. You want play to win - go comp


Sadly Competitive play is quick play 2.0 so there's not much of a difference depending how high your rank is and the mentality of the players on your team.

Generally no. If someone is dead set on doing something then you can't change it. The only thing you can do is try your absolute hardest to still win in spite of that. So instead of 'proving' your point because you disliked how the person was playing that hero you take it upon yourself to pick up the slack in every way you can. At least that's the mentality I have for comp. QP is pretty much the only place I get to play Mei now (too many people want to play DPS so I just go tank) so all I do is pick her and enjoy myself even if there's something 'better' I could do. I still do everything I can to win but that's the place where I try new wall spots or just have fun ( meaning you don't have to go with the most 'optimal' setup but still emphasis on trying to win though). So maybe your Orisa buddy wanted to do something different but still try to win whereas you just decided to throw the game it seems.


So, I can't play differently then? Why was I throwing and not the other guy, because I was proving a point to someone? That's hypocritical. The guy was a level 90, playing very odd, like he let his 6 year old play or something. How can I pick up his slack as mercy? The team was dying because he didn't want to be on the point.

I don't see why I have to try my hardest when it's just in vain. Especially in QP. Everyone acting like it's comp or something.

Ok, so, I was playing in QP trying to capture an objective, and this Orissa was on a balcony trying to play sniper while the rest of the team was on the objective. I kept repeating myself to get on the point! X4 I then started getting some uproar from some of my teammates, telling me that ""it's just QP"", so I changed from Mercy to Junkrat. I started to play just like him, playing junkrat the opposite way, dying on my way to the point. This lady just ended up going off on me, ""YOU'RE GETTING BLOCKED, REPORTED. YOU'RE F*#ING"", you sort of get the picture.

Was I in the wrong? Should I not try and prove a point in this game?


You were being a dickhead, two wrongs don't make a right, and there is no doubt that yours was the worse of the two wrongs.

He wasn't playing badly, he was playing bizarrely. He was playing the way a widow should, not an orissa. He was always behind the team, going his own way, never trying to get on point.

I wasn't getting back at him, but the people telling me it's QP. They didn't care if he was on point or not, so I didn't think they'd care about the match, so I switched and decided to play dumb to show them their own hypocrisy. I did everything I could.

you can always try and gently nudge them and give them tips on how to get better, as long as you're not mean about it I'm sure they won't react negatively.
QP is just harder to get people to switch in or to get them to play a certain way since there's not really a penalty like in competitive for losing, so people don't feel much of an obligation to switch or change things if your team is losing.

you were in the wrong here but the best you can do now is just try and approach things differently if this happens again. you can give them tips and tricks, or you can just sorta ignore it and try to support them the best you can or pick up where they might be slacking.

"To the Mercy players:

Right, we get it, you miss being the hero of the team with your game saving rez, earning your teammates' respect and your enemies' salt. Sorry you now have to think about who to rez, instead of just waiting for three people to die then rushing in with your ult. Sorry you can't just jump in front of the enemy team with the only consequence being your ult charge going back to 0 as your entire team comes back at once. Sorry that now after you ult you become more useful than just rezzing and hoping that was POTG. Sorry that now you can fly to a teammate nearly half-way across the map as much as you want for 20 whole seconds, making you almost untouchable if the other team isn't that good at hitting moving targets.

To everyone else complaining:

Sorry you now have to focus Mercy more at the START of the game instead of just waiting a few minutes before deciding that she was a real threat because she now has ult. Sorry that your Mercy decided to rez Reaper, not you. Sorry they rezzed the wrong person because you had ult, but died too close to your Lucio for her to be able to pick you out while the enemy shoots at her. And sorry that, now when she ults, you can still kill her before she rezzes the entire team.

"I dont get why people keep acting like new mercy is harder to play

sometimes with old mercy you had to actually make decisions with rez, contrary to popular belief

how many times did old mercy rez, only to have someone die half a second later? using rez was an assessment of risk/reward to think ""can i wait for this person to die, or do i pop rez now and keep them alive? and if i can wait for them to die, will someone respawn making me unable to rez them before then?""

you had to take multiple factors into the equation because you only have 1 click of the rez button

but NOW, mercy can pick up people as they die

before you valk you get 1 rez every thirty seconds and since obviously fighting 5v6 is bad, you rez as soon as someone dies

if you have an advantage and you get the early pick, then you still rez as soon as someone dies because its better to fight 6v5 in your favor than 5v5

as for when you have valk, you still rez as soon as someone dies, then you pop valk as soon as someone dies to rez them again

then IN valk, you have a 10 second cooldown, and the respawn timer is 10 seconds, which means that rather than ""making decisions about who to rez"" as people keep trying to say she has to do, what you instead do is;

rez someone as soon as they die, if you can rez them BEFORE another person dies, you can rez the next person too. you can ensure that they dont die long enough because you can heal everyone at once. also this entire time you can fly so dont worry about getting killed or anything

im not saying old rez was always the most complicated ability, but it was a hell of a lot more of a skill ceiling than mercy is now, and thats saying something

this isnt even mentioning the fact that mercy 2.0 is horrifically overpowered right now, being a literal mustpick with a 99% pickrate because fights in this game are determined by player advantage more than anything else and always having player advantage means you win every single time",10/13/2017 06:07 AM,"{""id"":""207575610056"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":2,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207572286133"",""name"":""FudgeShark""}}",post-11,287 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/FudgeShark-1695,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000001987.png,"Yo stop complaining about Mercy change, OK?",2001

God bless you for your post, it's beautiful. I mean it.
You put all my thoughts and frustrations I had had with the new Mercy in a wonderful, constructive and calm comment - couldn't do it better myself. I'm so tired of people defending this broken character (which used to be perfectly balanced) that I really can't articulate my thoughts in a neutral, non-offensive manner which you, on the contrary, managed perfectly.
Old Mercy was undeniably harder, required more skill on decision making part and was overall more fun and engaging. Nowadays I refuse to play Mercy 2.0 because this is the only character I can't improve with as a player which I always seek in videogaming. Frankly, it hurts - I want to see Mercy becoming a great, medium/hard to play, rewarding character with the new rework, yet I as a fan of the support class get the opposite. And what's more terrifying - people ask for more of this garbage, encourage Blizzard to transfer ultimate abilities (!) into mindless abilities on cooldowns. It's unhealthy for ""Overwatch"".

Buy your skin just before midnight on the 31st, (I believe the event actually ends at 11am GMT on the 1st November, but why risk it??) then DO NOT earn any more loot boxes until after the event ends...

I am using flick-shot as reacting to an enemy's position by quickly moving your crosshair to them and shooting them. Basically I am using this definition from Reddit:

Essentially Flick-Shotting is a method of aiming that relies on your unconscious cognition and muscle memory, rather than cognitive aiming. It is a reactionary shot and much quicker than conventional aim.


As Hanzo I am completely reacting, that ""bounce"" that is sometimes there, is me unconsciously adjusting my aim because I am accounting for the movement. By this definition it is still a flick. I am not thinking about my aim, I am just relying on my muscle memory on trusting my arrow will hit it's mark.",10/13/2017 06:13 AM,"{""id"":""207576805650"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207474398060"",""name"":""Caliginous""}}",post-11,578 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Caliginous-11116,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000159B.png,Can Projectile Heroes flick.,2002
"Flick/twitch aiming is by opposition to tracking, and as far as I know are the two main aiming techniques.

When tracking, you try to follow the target continuously, keeping the crosshairs on the target all the time.

When flicking, you only follow the target roughly, then at specific times you try to pass through your target, and rely on your muscle memory to fire at the correct time (when you're supposed to be on target). Because you don't have to stop on the target (no deceleration phase for your hand), it's faster than tracking, which improves precision at shooting time, but decreases it the rest of the time.

Tracking is suitable for continuous fire, whereas flicking is suitable for single shots.

The only difference projectile vs hitscan makes, is that for projectiles, the target will not be the model, but a predicted point near it.

Other than that, you still have to track with Orisa, and flick with hanzo. For zen and ana you can do both, but I find it more efficient to click each shot than continuously press m1 (flick).",10/13/2017 07:02 AM,"{""id"":""207577606269"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":3,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""207510386634"",""name"":""eren""}}",post-12,534 posts,,https://us.battle.net/forums/static/images/avatars/overwatch/avatar-overwatch-default.png,Can Projectile Heroes flick.,2002

I'd rather have a winston-like bear, but stereotypes are good, cause they content truth. There's also a lot of alcoholics named ivan in Russia :/

There's nothing russian in Zarya. Even her accent was created in hollywood. Even modern hollywood can't find russian-speaking people to play bad-guy russians (and russians are always bad guys).

Wired is always better, but wireless can be okay. It sounds like there is a lot of interference in your wifi or your router is being overloaded. It sucks that PS4 can't connect to 5GHz networks, which could solve your problem. Scan the wifi signals around your PS4 and your router. Then switch the channel to the one with least interference.

"Yesterday, I was in a Mystery Heroes at the Ilios well, and one McCree was tearing it up. I thought he was really good. At first.

...and then, while I was playing Junkrat, I triggered a mine to escape a Roadhog. I was a good thirty yards away, and the McCree was looking down at the rest of my team. When I bounced into his view, he instantly (as in, the animation didn't keep up) retargeted to me and hit me with a headshot before I moved more than a couple of yards. Total time about a quarter of a second.

""Hey, lucky shot,"" you might say. But he kept doing that - hitting people at the edge of his vision, at range, with headshot after headshot, or nailing someone exactly as they came around corners, with zero warning. Every once in a while, you'd see him point his pistol at the ground and Fan the Hammer, which seems odd, until you realize that he was hitting 100% of his shots, almost all instakills, at every range, never actually missing, so he needed to get his hit rate below 100%.

When I mentioned an aimbot (but not the name or character), everyone on my team went, ""yeah, that McCree isn't even being subtle about it...""

"I only noticed one person who was 100% hacking so far. They did it pretty obvious and couldn't even win with it (aimbotting).

Also sometimes I'm accused of hacking because somethings wrong with my nerval system so that sometimes you can see micro movements of the mouse that normal people don't usually have while still hitting a lot. I now use a way lower sensitivity to reduce this effect but it still sometimes happens.

I don't deny there are hackers, and from what I have seen on Youtube so far there are hacks out there that are hard to differentiate from skill but sometimes people just get lucky or really have superior aim.

"I once had a tracer on Volskaya. I was defending.

I placed Symmetras teleporter in what I thought was an out of the way place.

Tracer appears the second it's down. The SECOND. Blasts me, and it, to little Tracer Bites(tm).

I already thought her awareness in the killcams and accuracy through blinking was fishy. Fast forward:

Point A is 30% theirs. My team is fighting. I get my ult.

I have not been in the fight, as I was trying to backline Symm. So I wait for Tracer to die, and when she does, I run away.

I place the Teleporter upstairs from the point..If you are looking towards point A from Point B, it's the upper left room. I place it and hide in a corner, crouched.

Sure enough, Tracer ignores capping, ignores my team, ignores looking anywhere on point A, and zips up to that room. No looking around. No going to:
1) The health behind the point.
2) The arcade rooms to the left of spawn.

Both are THE spots to place shield Gens.

But nope; never even checked. Just went across the gap from upper right to upper left, blinked inside already locked onto my shield gen.
She proceeded to blink around while melting it, never once missing or losing her lock-on.

Now keep in mind; a real Symmetra would have put the shield gen near Point A, where we were still fighting. Tracer had no reason to promptly come to point B, in an area the shield gen is never put, and 'guess' where it is without looking.

Nobody is denying there are cheaters out there, but too many people are too quick to blame their own shortcomings, mistakes or just dumb luck on people cheating. I've been accused of cheating in games before and I never have. I suspect that playing online we all have been accused at some point or another. If I'm getting steamrolled in this game though it usually has more to do with the other team just being better coordinated than we are than one person wiping the floor with us. And more than likely if a person is mopping the floor with me it's because they're just better than I am.

The problem isn't the lack of cheaters - it's that you, and so many other players, are so deeply unobservant.

Like I mentioned above: some people are just insanely unobservant.

I caught one today.

Its the fact that you'll be flying into, often a bad situation to revive. After you do that you want to get out and fly back to a teammate.

I don't agree with the change but I still don't think strafing and GA are comparable.

Strafing is that or no movement at all. While GA you still have full movement besides the ability itself. Not to mention on how fast GA is compared to strafing. And then you also have to consider that it's even faster when ult is used, and even when it's down you can pretty much no clip around the map.

If I had to guess on why they would do it, is just to make Mercy a bit more vulnerable during a rez. As the only real way to shut her down is to have a really good Widow, in which Widow is situational, or Mccree. As nothing can really effectively hit her and burst her down before she leaves, especially with her non interrupted passive healing. And as we've discussed, 1.5 seconds isn't a lot of time anyways.

Without ult, I don't see it being a good rez. If it's dangerous for you to rez them. Most likely it'll be dangerous for them coming out of rez.",10/12/2017 09:21 AM,"{""id"":""207577404557"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":6,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207481692662"",""name"":""JUSTAHOLiDAY""}}",post-8,300 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/JUSTAHOLiDAY-1552,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000BC1.png,Don't take away mobility of supports,2002

"I mean with the invulenerability gone it's literally our only chance of getting out alive? The second you flying in you're being targetted by everyone on that team. The new ress isn't worth it if you're ressing the guy in the other room no where near a team fight when there isn't a mass engage going on. It works by getting that tank that died in the thick of it back, or that dead dps currently under the junkrat's !@#$ up. It's literally about making that choice and praying you can fly out of harm's way in time, we literally have no other chance at staying alive as the person takes a while to be able to move, we're squishy as %^-* and quite slow.

It's not like we're flying out too quick at the moment, I still dying trying to fly in/fly out. Your dps just need to be on top of it when I do. You know, like when a genji, tracer, or symm come running at my face and I have no fly away and you pray the dps on your team turn around to deal with them? That kind of attention.

Our one chance at an out isn't impossible to counter, in fact its very easy to kill her on the way there or on the way out as she moves in a straight line between her position and her target's position.

For genji with the current deflect box maybe you are right, but tracer:
1. Has only 150HP.
2. Ultimate which requires aim andcan't kill tanks (300dmg in the center of explosion) and has small radius.
3. Also, tracer's weapon is lethal in mostly close range, where 150 hp is not always enough. Currently with every game having junkrat it's nuts.

It's not the length of the cooldown - it's the fact that you have to wait any longer than an instant to dash away after rezzing.

I only play Mercy out of necessity, so I'm not sure how much this will affect Mercy players.


It shouldn't and that's the thing.

If you are unable to survive 1.5 seconds in any given place, then you are out of position in the first place. Mercy shouldn't need to rely on getting a free pass with an automatic GA reset.

It's funny how people defend Mercy by saying things like she needs to make certain calls, but when changes are made that put more emphasis on actually making those calls well, people freak because now the one their defending from the brain dead accusations is now able to make mistakes and it's too much for them (same thing happened when there was a campaign to extend her Res range, people were afraid of making a bad call and suicide Resing).

Mercy mains are not exempt from mistakes, and as such they are not exempt from crying about their problems existing instead of learning how to avoid the situations in the first place.",10/13/2017 01:30 AM,"{""id"":""207575409027"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":1},""author"":{""id"":""207425676512"",""name"":""Slyther0829""}}",post-25,4703 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Slyther0829-1317,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000114A.png,Don't take away mobility of supports,2002

Do you really think 1.5 seconds is too long of a cooldown?
Its the fact that you'll be flying into, often a bad situation to revive. After you do that you want to get out and fly back to a teammate.

And by your logic, of 1.5 seconds being a very insignificant number(which it isnt, a second can mean a !@#$ton in this type of game) than why does it matter if you don't need to wait?

So you want to be immortal when using super? A 20 second ultimate and people want to cry about a 1.5 second cooldown? If you had to fly to someone in your team who died in the heat of battle then its their fault for terrible positioning. Why should mercy be able to fly in, revive someone and get out without a scratch? Im glad this is happening because there will be some counter play to this BS that mercy is able to pull at the moment.

""Dont take away mobility from Supports!""

Proceeds to only talk about Mercy.

Well, they did recently nerf Lucio's wallriding speed as well.

In my opinion, this GA nerf is a game changer. Blizzard has been changing the nature of Mercy gameplay a little too much in such a short time. Ressurect has already become an extremely dangerous ability to use. Previously, Rez was a 15 meter range with no requirement of LoS. Now it's an extremely short 3 meter range with requirement of LoS. An 80% reduction in range. At least with the new Mercy, you can Rez, and instantaneously fly out. 1.5 seconds may seem extremely short in comparison to every other ability cooldown in the game, but most reaction times are less than a second. If you know where the dead body is, you know where Mercy is going to stop. At least before, Rez was a gamble, now it's suicide a lot of the time, with the range reduction and cooldown reset removed.

I find the current version of Mercy on PTR pretty perfect. The special mobility they've added to GA with the bunny hop mechanic is nice, but no where as helpful/pivotal as the cooldown reset.",10/13/2017 02:13 AM,"{""id"":""207575706711"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":2},""author"":{""id"":""207427275407"",""name"":""Raven""}}",post-31,674 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Raven-14111,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000D0A.png,Don't take away mobility of supports,2002

Yeah, there's literally no penalty for you leaving in the hero pick screen if you don't want to fill. Someone else will just come along and be willing to fill.

Besides, you're not gonna go far in Legendary difficulty if you're not playing your most optimal hero. So even filling is not a good idea in that difficulty.

maps can remain the same. But extra players should become a function for custom games. So that people could add more slots if they want. Maybe a boss fight of 1v30. Something like WOW.

You have got to admit that Zarya is one of the most difficult heroes to design skins for. I mean she is a 6foot7 tall giant lesbian, you try design a skin for her.

"Viable indeed.

Now he doesn't have to choose whether he wants to run or do damage, he has the ability to do both with his mines.

In addition he can now traverse the map without waiting a century to be able to do so.

His ultimate also can now get into position but can still be 1 shot by (Take your pick: Pharah rocket, Junkrat Mine and his Nades, Firestrike, etc.)

Also he doesn't kill himself anymore when someone is next to him...meaning a tank can't just walk up to Junkrat and watch as he pathetically dies to his own nades...whilst most likely helping that tank by giving them Ult charge or in Zarya's case Beam charge.

He can be strong in the right hands but he is still counterable with characters like Zarya and Pharah. He's in a balanced state right now (I personally think so.

Sound is often a much better que then sight when you are focusing on a fight. To tell if a ult is coming and where its coming from.

Junkrat screams fire in the hole and then you get a about a second before it even deploys. So hide behide a wall scatter behide differnt covers.

D.va ult can't get stable impact even on mid-high gold.

The only difference is that Junkrat himself has a little more leeway when it comes to his mines, and his ult isn't a complete waste anymore.

Stop complaining about him being OP. He's fine just as he is now. If Blizzard nerfs him because of listening to the numerous stupid !@# threads like this one, this game will continue to be an imbalanced mess where only 1-2 characters in each role are viable, and the rest are complete $%^.

He is second most picked dps overall. First is soldier this month, and mccree this week (both probably just to counter junkrat). Junkrat's winrate is waaay higher than any other dps. His stats look really unhealthy atm, I wonder why blizzard didn't put any changes on ptr yet.

He's the only defense hero that even breaks the top half of the hero list in pick rate at any rank in the game. At gold and below he's the most picked DPS, but above that he's the least picked DPS in said top-half of the roster.

He's fine.


How is that a measure of whether he is fine or not? He's terribly awful to play against and feels too easy to get kills with.

Reduce the mine damage to 90/100 and increase his ult charge time. It charges way too quickly. The tire used to be a bit of a joke so it was okay having such a quick charge up time but now the buffs to it have made it a more viable ult. The only problem is, you can have it up too quickly!",10/11/2017 06:54 AM,"{""id"":""207576406453"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":3},""author"":{""id"":""207529829742"",""name"":""KelloNutello""}}",post-53,91 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/KelloNutello-1379,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000002487.png,Junkrat Mine and Ult Nerf When?,2002

Gotta love how people want Defense heros to be buffed and usable, they do it to Junkrat, and now everyone wants him nerfed back into the ground. However a nerf to his ult charge I do believe would be fair.

I don't think that's how ult charge works.

10 seconds sounds unlikely, but that is exactly how ult charge works. You can definitely get a wheel in the first 10 seconds of KoTH games. It's based off damage you deal, and different ults require varying amount of damage dealt to fully charge.

As an example, Graviton is the most expensive ult, and is considered one of the most powerful. It takes 1850 charge, whereas Junkrat's tire only requires 1575 charge, while having far superior firepower to Zarya.

And honestly, since the buff to the tire, it's too much. It's way too easy to get a pick with rip-tire for an ult that's almost guaranteed to be available every team fight.",10/13/2017 06:10 AM,"{""id"":""207576509150"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":1,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""197376993544"",""name"":""Rain3d""}}",post-63,2142 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Rain3d-2343,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x0250000000000BB3.png,Junkrat Mine and Ult Nerf When?,2002

She has gotten a rework that demands higher level of play, specifically in regards to game sense the skill that Mercy relies upon, to be proficient with, and this has made her not actually any more viable than she was, but reintroduced her to players at the top which disregarded Mercy before as a ""No skill"" hero, and as they felt they were too skilled for her never played her.",10/12/2017 11:07 AM,"{""id"":""207577605262"",""valueVoted"":0,""rank"":{""voteUp"":0,""voteDown"":0},""author"":{""id"":""185988272105"",""name"":""Phantombit""}}",post-12,380 posts,https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/career/pc/us/Phantombit-1729,https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/game/unlocks/0x025000000000113E.png,Mei buff incoming?,2002
