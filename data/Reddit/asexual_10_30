#The Basics  

**Asexual Person-** A person who experiences a lack of sexual attraction toward anyone of any gender. _Ace_ is slang for asexual.

**Allosexual/Sexual Person-** A person who experiences sexual attraction toward one or more genders, depending on their sexual preference. Essentially the opposite of an Asexual.  

___________________________________________________________________________________________
_With this in mind, know that asexuality is an umbrella term for people who are not only asexual but fall in between asexual and allosexual._  
___________________________________________________________________________________________


**Demisexual Person-** A person who feels sexual attraction only after a strong emotional bond. (Resource Center:[http://demisexuality.org/](http://demisexuality.org/))

**Gray/Greysexual Person-** A person who feels sexual attraction infrequently. The term ""gray/greysexual"" applies to someone who falls anywhere on the spectrum between asexual and allosexual. Some also experience a low sex drive accompanied with sexual attraction.  

___________________________________________________________________________________________

_Here is a lit of sub-asexual identities that are more specific than just asexual or on the spectrum:_  
___________________________________________________________________________________________



**Akio/Lithsexual Person-** A person who experiences sexual attraction but does not wish for it to be reciprocated.

**Autochorissexual Person-** A person who feels a disconnection between them and the sexual target of arousal. 

**Cupiosexual Person-** A person who has a lack of sexual attraction but still desires a sexual relationship.

**Fraysexual Person-** Any sexual attraction fades for this person after meeting the target of their attraction.

**Placiosexual Person-** A person who has little to no desire to receive a sexual act, but enjoys preforming sexual acts on others. 

**Reciprosexual Person-** A person who feels sexual attraction only after discovering someone is attracted to them.  

 ___________________________________________________________________________________________

_The second most important step to understanding asexuality is to know that sexual and romantic attraction are not the same. (In fact, there are at least [5 different types of attraction that you can experience or lack.](http://65.media.tumblr.com/270ca5b842df95f42ee2d87393f1d880/tumblr_nmrka1v6ji1th3zx5o1_r1_540.png)) For example, someone could be biromantic but heterosexual--they can crave a romantic relationship with two genders but sexually prefer only one gender. In the same way, someone can be asexual yet homoromantic. Any prefix that comes before a sexual orientation (A-, Abro-, Bi-, Cetero-, Demi-, Gray/Grey-, Hereto-, Homo-, Pan-, Poly-, etc.) can also come before a romantic orientation._

#FAQ  

_**Am I asexual?**_  

Only you can know, but advice and guidance can be found here and in other asexual communities. Reading the rest of this post or visiting AVEN may also point you in the right direction.

_**What does sexual attraction feel like?**_  
At its strongest, it is commonly described as a feeling of hunger, except for people. It can include tingling feelings in your head or elsewhere, feeling hot inside your body, or general tension and the uncontrollable need to touch someone. Summed up, it is the desire to be sexual with someone.


_**Am I too young to know if I’m asexual?**_  

Asexuals too often get told that they’ll “find someone eventually” or that they’re “just late-bloomers”. The earliest age to start feeling or showing signs of sexual attraction are around 10-11, or when puberty occurs. Despite this, people can lack sexual attraction until their late teens or older. If you’re a teenager and asexuality matches how you feel, then feel free to identify as it; just know it could change when you’re older (although I’ve found that if you have a hunch about yourself being ace, you’re more than likely to be correct regardless of age). 


_**Can someone be asexual and masturbate/have sex/[ANYTHING SEXUAL]?**_  

Definitely. Since asexuality isn't equivalent to having a lack of libido, masturbating and having sex is something aces may or may not do. Some of us enjoy having sex or masturbating, some of us only enjoy getting others off or masturbate simply to “clean out the pipes”, and others never have and never will. As long as you don't feel sexual attraction, you are still asexual. Sexual attraction and behavior are two separate things. Furthermore, asexual people can feel sex-favorable, sex-indifferent, sex-averse, or sex-repulsed(most extreme form of sex-averse). This refers to ones feelings or attitudes towards having sex, which may fluctuate between any of the three. Someone can also be sex-positive, sex-neutral, or sex-negative, which is more political and represents their stance on sex in society.

_**What is the difference between sexual attraction and libido?**_  
Libido is the need or “appetite” for sexual release, and people can have low, normal, or high libido. Having a sex drive does not necessarily mean that you want to use it or target it on someone, so therefore it is independent from sexual attraction. 
[More information](http://anagnori.tumblr.com/post/69803256941/whats-the-difference-between-sex-drive-sexual) on the differences between sex drive, sexual attraction, sexual arousal, sexual desire, etc. 


_**What’s the difference between asexuality and celibacy?**_  

Celibacy is not having sex for personal reasons, despite any desires or attractions felt. Asexuality is not experiencing sexual attraction, but does not dictate whether or not someone has sex.


_**I feel asexual, but how do I know it’s not because I’m unhealthy in some way? Should I get my hormones checked?**_  

Many physiological issues (as well as some medications) can cause a low sex-drive. These include but are not limited to depression, anxiety, excessive stress, and even low self-esteem or body image. If you suspect or are sure you were asexual before any of these things took effect, then you shouldn’t worry. If you’re not sure, then there’s a chance your disinterest in sex could be related to things outside of asexuality(such as HSDD). In this case, you might want to get your hormones checked just to be safe. If everything turns out fine, then you are likely asexual. 


_**Can I become asexual?**_  

Sexuality is fluid, and therefore can change naturally. You can’t force yourself to become asexual or vice versa. On the other hand, it is valid to point out that one's sex drive can change throughout their life. As explained before, asexuality is SEPARATE from libido, and therefore a drastic change in your libido can make it feel like you've suddenly become asexual. Otherwise, asexuality is as stable as any other sexual orientation, and while sexuality is fluid it isn't super common to change completely from allosexual or asexual. 


_**I am asexual, should I come out?**_  

First of all understand that there is no obligation, and that this is a very personal decision. If you chose to come out, the very safest bet is to come out to someone who is LGBTQIAP+ friendly, or has a higher chance of understanding. Though it is a preference, many people enjoy having at least one person that they can talk or rant to about their ace-related experiences. You know your friends and family better than anyone here does: determine who you personally want to tell, and be prepared to explain yourself. If anyone denies your asexuality, or uses any of [these classic phrases](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d0/dd/42/d0dd42db976fc244e37bc95b4ebaf537.jpg), then they are not worth your time.  As for coming out to partners, it’s best to tell them sooner rather than later. You are not broken and do not need to be fixed, and understand that you are supported and loved here and in other asexual communities!  

_**I am/may be asexual, but I'm having doubts. Is this normal?**_  
Yes, having doubts about your asexuality is very common among aces. If these doubts persist or you have a serious problem with being asexual though, it's advisable to find a therapist to help you out. Sometimes asexuals feel sexually curious because of doubts, wonder if they're just socially awkward, wonder if they're just allosexual with a low-libido, the list goes on. Just understand that asexuality isn't a category to trap yourself in, it's meant to be useful and fit you. You don't have to identify with it if you don't want to. There is no specific reason why you are the way you are, it just happens or you're born that way. Understand that it's not just okay, but important to be yourself, and you're valid no matter what!  
_**I'm in a asexual-allosexual relationship, how to proceed?**_   

Every relationship has a problem area where lines don’t quite meet up. It’s here where the partners have to make compromises with each other, or else it might not work out. You may have heard before that the key to a relationship is communication, and so this is the only real solution to asexual-allosexual relationship issues. On [AVEN's FAQ](http://www.asexuality.org/home/?q=relationship.html), you can find all the answers to all your relationship concerns you’d ever need. However, what you can’t find is suggestions on how to make compromises in asexual-allosexual relationships, which is what we will provide you with. But to begin, know what each partner is comfortable with doing and what they’re not comfortable with.  

* Partners can make a schedule for when they will have sex- this way, the asexual can have time to mentally prepare themselves before sex and the allosexual can perform their sexual desires.  

* Have an open relationship. The allosexual can go to someone else for sex but keep a loving and supportive relationship with the asexual. As long as everyone involved is aware and accepting of what’s happening, it’s not cheating or morally wrong but constructive instead.
* Other compromises can be more customized to your personal situation. Feel free to ask the community.  

#For those who cannot fathom asexuality(or have further questions):  
_Here is a smaller FAQ list of questions often asked asexuals, that haven't already been addressed or explained above._  
_**...how are you asexual?**_  
Asexuality isn't a choice. This question is just as unexplainable as trying to answer ""how are you gay?"". If it's hard to imagine, picture someone you know that you're not sexually attracted to (preferably of a gender you're not sexually attracted to). Sex with them would be cringey, right? Maybe you'd go with it to make _them_ happy if they were sexually attracted to you, but given a choice you probably wouldn't do it. Now, just imagine if that's how you felt for everyone of every gender. You're libido is still there, you just don't feel like having sex with anyone. That's what asexuality is.  
_**What do you think about when you masturbate?**_  
If an asexual _does_ masturbate, they can think about a wide range of things. Some of these include generic people having sex (since aces have no sexual attraction they usually don't think of specif people they know), a fetish, scenery/something comforting, or nothing at all.   
_**Does being asexual make you more productive?**_  
No. There are some aces who are generally very productive, just as there are some allosexuals who are generally very productive. What someone does with their time varies by the person. Someone with a high-libido may spend a lot of time thinking and having sex, while someone with a low-libido may spend a lot of time listening and writing music (regardless of being ace or allosexual).  
_**Is asexuality really an orientation, or does everyone who is ace just have chemical or behavioral issues?**_  
Since there are high-libido asexuals, then no, it's not a chemical issue. Most asexuals, if checked by a doctor, have relatively normal libidos. Some have low libidos, but that doesn't mean they have a problem to be fixed: they're still asexual. There isn't an overflowing amount of scientific research behind asexuality so far, but the U.S Sheep Experiment Station did a study to find out why their sheep weren't boning efficiently. The results found that 4-5% of the sheep were gay, and 2-3% were asexual. Seeing this in animals as well helps support that it's not a behavioral issue, put together with the fact that most asexuals have no issues or feel no distress about being asexual.  
_**Do you like being asexual?**_  
There are some aces that express doubts or concerns about their orientation, just as there are some gay people who have doubts or concerns about their orientation. Generally though, asexuals don't care that they're asexual. Some prefer not having to worry about sex, and others feel as though they're missing out because of the emphasis society puts onto sex. Explaining the joys of having sex to an asexual is similar to explaining color to the blind; we don't know what we're missing out on. Unlike having HSSD, asexuals aren't overwhelmingly distressed about their sexual situation and don't long for a working sexual relationship.  

_**I wish I were asexual. It seems a lot easier.**_   
Be careful what you wish for. For many people, asexuality is an invisible orientation. Since it's not widely recognized, lots of people don't realize they can be asexual when questioning their orientation, and the path to simply discovering your asexuality can be very complicated. Depending on their family members, some asexuals are sent to doctors or camps in attempts to be ""fixed."" Some asexual get distasteful reactions for not having children or trying to come out. Also, being asexual doesn't mean you'll never feel horny: asexuals can feel horny too, only it's uncomfortable and frustrating because the horny-ness is not directed or easily satisfied... it's just sort of there. Asexuals can also have a difficult time trying to maintain a relationship will an allosexual person depending on the allosexual's needs. It's not bad to be asexual, but it can have it's downsides and frustrating moments like any other orientation.

#And now for a foolproof method to figure out if you’re asexual: introducing, the [""You might be asexual if..."" thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/4l3f69/you_might_be_asexual_thread/)














",Asexual
How can you tell between asexual and sexually repressed?,"I'm asking this for my sister (32 F). 

She has never had an orgasm and is generally uncomfortable with physical closeness. She's spent most of her life in long-term relationships with men, and her lack of desire for sex has caused issues, though she doesn't completely abstain.

We've speculated that she may be repressed, lesbian, a victim of sexual assault (she drank very heavily as a teen and remembers feeling objectified and used, but there's also a lot she doesn't remember from blacking out). She has thought all of these things could be possible.

She's always seemed uncomfortable with ""sexiness"" in a way that reminds me of kids, so I always thought she was sexually repressed. She recently found out about asexuality and thought the description fit, but isn't sure. She doesn't necessarily want to be, but doesn't have those feelings or the ability to orgasm.

How can you tell the difference between a sexual identity that isn't something to be ""fixed"" (e.g. asexuality), or something that can be worked through with therapy (e.g. repression due to past traumatic experiences, etc.)?",Asexual
what am I?,"so, to start off, I know that labels are not that necessary but it would be nice to know at least my approximate sexuality, or narrow down the closest ones and research further about them. 

I'm female, never had sex, might do it only out of curiosity (to see how it is and add to the list of things I've done), even though I will probably not enjoy it that much.

I don't masturbate, porn is boring but I read steamy fanfiction and  occasionally have fantasies about some people. 

basically, I like sex in theory but not in practice

I'm not very romantic or good at expressing feelings but not completely aromantic either. Mostly heteroromantic but I can see myself with a girl if we are perfect soulmates. 

my ideal relationship would be a very good friendship with deep soul connection and cuddles/kisses. 

the previous relationships didn't work because I didn't want to jump into bed with them. 

not sure if I have libido because I'm asexual or because of depression and hormonal imbalance. Might have felt arousal a few times.

sorry if this is not very logically organized. so, any ideas on what I might be? :) ",Asexual
Am I Autochoris/Aegosexual?,"So, I've been talking to people over the past few weeks, and I think that the label autochorissexual (or aegosexual) would be a good fit for me. I was quite confident for a while, though now I sense that it has begun to falter a little. So I think I may need a little bit of reassurance for this. So, I've just decided to ask about it here. Does the label seem to be a good fit for me? I'll provide context below. I'm sorry if I shouldn't be doing this.

Context:

When it comes to relationships, my two crushes (the only ones I've ever had) were purely romantic, and all I desired was the emotional aspect. Sex really isn't an aspect I want in a relationship, and in my vision of a perfect relationship sex is absent. I ﻿can recall thinking why people would ruin a perfectly good relationship with sex, though I can understand why people do it now. When it comes to other things though, I do have a libido, and masturbate, though I know that it doesn't really matter all that much. I usually only do it because I'm bored. If I ever use visuals I don't concentrate on who's doing what, but rather what's being done. It's more of the act than anything else. If I have any sort of fantasy, it's not about any specific person, but an anonymous figure, though I can but a person in there, it just doesn't really add anything. If it's someone I know pe﻿rsonally, or a stranger where there's no sexual aspect to whatever image I'm looking at, it feels weird to me. If it﻿﻿'s a stranger that has some sort of sexual thing happening then I can substitute them there but nothing really changes. There's also this weird feeling. I can get this feeling out of nowhere, where my heart rate increases and I can sometimes get this weird tingling ""down there"" (though it's definitely not anywhere close to﻿ full arousal, if it's arousal at all). This can occur from physical proximity or looking at someone (often with people I guess I'd find aesthetically attractive, though I don't actively﻿ think of them as such). My thoughts don't really line up with it, and I'm usually just thinking about the fact that I'm feeling something. It's a little jarring, I guess. It also goes away very quickly. If it makes any difference though, I am 16 and thus hormones may pay a part.

When I was younger, I used to get that same﻿ feeling, albeit stronger, when looking at people, but at it's strongest I'm pretty sure there was a clear trigger. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the trigger was bra straps for me (oof this is kinda embarrassing), and that's when it would be at it's strongest. I would just get this urge to just kinda stare. If I'm being honest I'm not sure what I was thinking, though it was probably just on the bra straps. On top of that, I was also masturbating at this age, and I remember it feeling better when I was in a room with a lot of people I didn't know around my age, but I don't remember wanting to talk with any of them or wanting sex with them or anything, just that it would feel better than usual when I ""did the thing"" afterward. Though, I haven't felt a feeling that strong in a long time, and the thing with bra straps is completely gone. And I was pretty much smack dab in the middle of puberty there so hormones may have been a larger influence.

Checklist:

Why I might be ace:

1. Both previous crushes were purely romantic.
2. I’d be fine living without sex.
3. Sex is absent in my visions of a perfect relationship (not really a factor I consider)

Why I might NOT be ace:

1. I have a libido and masturbate very frequently.
2. Often use visual stimulus.
3. I can imagine myself in a sexual situation with people.
4. I can have fantasies with figures both male and female.
5. I get that “tingle” when looking at people sometimes.
6. When younger…
   1. Had bra strap trigger.
   2. Masturbating often felt better after being around a lot of new people my age.

How did you know you were asexual?,"Hi there!
I have a questions, how did you guys know that you were asexual?

I (23F) am struggling with figuring out my sexuality and any advice would be so appreciated. 

So to give you some context, I've always thought I was straight, but sex has never really been on my mind. I grew up always being equated to sex, like anything I did I felt that it was taken in a sexual way (ie hanging out with boys when I was 6, actually using a massager for my back you know? Girls are also just hypersexualized in general) but this always frustrated me. Sexs never really been on my mind, I don't get turned on watching it in movies nor do I think sexually when I look at people. 
So I thought maybe I just like girls? So I tried a girl dating site but I wasn't having it so maybe I'm just bi? But that doesn't feel right. 
I've been sexual in relationships but it's always been the other person starting it, and I participate cause sometimes (maybe) it'll feel good, or I just like the attention of someone in that way. But my mind's always been on something else, again sex just isn't on my mind. The only time I get turned on is when I'm drunk. 

I'm Muslim and now I wear hijab and honestly it's the best feeling ever. I'm rarely sexualized (I still like to dress cute) but it's bringing up thoughts that maybe I'm asexual? Like I'm willing to have sex because I want to have a baby in the future, but I really don't enjoy it that much. It's a lot of pressure, it's complictated, and I'd rather be doing something else like reading or drawing. 

The guy (30M and Muslim) I'm seeing now and looking to getting married soon is really really sexual. Like he has a lot of fantasies that I don't want to do and I get tired of his urges a lot. Irrallt like him but I'm not really having it.

I should also note that I've experienced a lot of sexual trauma with assault and rape, so maybe it's something to do with that? Even as a young teen though I didn't get turned on as much as my friends did.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the long post but I'd appreciate and feed back or stories you have of how you came to know you were asexual. Thank you! ❤️

#AsexualAwarenessWeek Day 6: What isn't asexuality?,"#AsexualAwarenessWeek Day 6: What isn't asexuality?

Well, all week, I've talked about what asexuality is, but what about what it isn't? There are a lot of misconceptions about asexuality. People think something is wrong with asexuals or that it is a choice. Sure, there may be some people who falsely identify as asexual, either because of ignorance or to cover something else up, but there are many people who genuinely are asexual. This is what they want you to understand.

Asexuality isn't:

i) a disorder. There are three common disorders that people try to label asexuals with. They are male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, and sexual aversion disorder. These are all incorrect. The first two, previously combined as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, are sexual dysfunctions characterized by a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. However, in the updated edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), it states that these criteria must be marked with clinically sufficient personal distress, meaning the person lacking the desire for sexual activity must exhibit or feel a level of anxiety due to the absence. It also has a portion that states that if someone self identifies as asexual, the diagnosis of these disorders would not be made. For the third disorder, sexual aversion disorder, it was removed from the DSM, so it isn't even a valid diagnosis anymore.

ii) trauma. Yes, some asexuals have experienced trauma, but it didn't make them asexual. They were asexual before the trauma. Trauma doesn't make someone lose their sexual attraction though it can make them averse to sex, and that's something that may need to be addressed if they wish to address it.

iii) a disability. Asexuality is not a physical problem. It is not a result of something wrong in or with the body. Many asexuals will say all their equipment works just fine. Everyone, allosexual or asexual, has varying levels of libido, so some asexuals experience low to high level sex drives, and quite a few asexuals can still feel arousal and complete a sexual act. It's the lack of sexual attraction that characterizes asexuality.

iv) a hormonal issue. Often, hormonal issues result in a sudden loss of sexual desire. Many asexuals are in good health and have had their hormones checked. Many would say they never had the sexual feelings from the get-go. If a person experienced sexual desires before and then lost them for some reason, that is a medical problem, not asexuality. 

v) celibacy or abstinence. Celibacy and abstinence are choices. Abstinence is the absence of sexual intercourse while celibacy is the avoidance of all sexual activity. Asexuality isn't a choice; it is the absence of sexual attraction. People who are abstinent or celibate still have sexual attraction and feelings, but they choose to abstain from sex despite their desires. Also, quite a few asexuals still have sex, so they are definitely not abstaining.

vi) a phase. One's sexual orientation starts showing itself around 10 years old. Sure, there are some people who develop later than others, but most people know their sexuality early on. If a person isn't too young to know they are allosexual, why are they too young to know they are asexual? There are people in their middle ages and older who are asexual, and there are teenagers too. Sexuality can change due to varying factors throughout one's life, but when they say they are asexual, at that moment (and probably continuing on from that point), they are. Respect that.

vii) a fear or hatred of sex. Being asexual doesn't mean you hate sex or people who have sex nor does it have to mean you fear it. Anyone can hate or fear sex, but you will find many asexuals who do not. Some may not want sex. Some may be indifferent towards it, and some are favorable and would readily engage in sexual activity. There are also asexuals who are sex neutral or positive, and just as there are sex negative asexuals, there are also sex negative allosexuals.

viii) an excuse. It's not an excuse for one's singleness, attractiveness, virginity, etc. It's an orientation.

ix) a repression of one's true sexuality. Asexuality is a true sexuality. Sexuality is a description of one's experience of sexual attraction and the targets of it. Not experiencing sexual attraction is just as valid. Asexuals aren't closeted homosexuals or sex shaming individuals. They are asexuals.

x) the result of a bad experience. A bad relationship or a disappointing sexual encounter doesn't make someone asexual. A person may lose sexual interest for a while as they recover from the bad experience, but they do not lose their attraction, meaning they are not asexual.

xi) frigidness or inhumanity. An asexual person is as capable of love as anyone else, be it romantic or platonic. The lack of sexual attraction doesn't negate their humanity, and it doesn't give anyone the right to judge them on their standards of what makes a person human.

These are common misconceptions people harbor about asexuality or ignorant responses people have given to those who identify as asexual, so I felt it important to address this. Tomorrow is the last day of Asexual Awareness Week, so I will finish up with some difficulties asexuals have faced because of their asexuality and cool parts of the asexual culture.

TL;DR: Asexuality isn't a disorder, trauma, a disability, a hormonal issue, celibacy/abstinence, a phase, a fear/hatred of sex, an excuse, a repression of one's true sexuality, the result of a bad experience, frigidness, or inhumanity. It's an orientation. That's it.

Feeling some sort of denial or pressure,"After years of debate and experimenting with my sexuality, seeing how I react and desire things (Or lack of..) i think I might be Ace. Originally for the longest time I seriously thought it was a case of strong bisexuality due to my libido and maybe a bit of societal pressure bit it's like, whenever I see others in relationships and how they are attracted, there has never been the same feeling. Idk, I always felt maybe something would kick in and stuff, maybe there would be that same exact feeling or infatuation but every single time I had a slight inclination of interest in that way (how I perceived it of course) it would immediately die off. 

I'm also sort of tired of the whole thing where people will tell you to just find the right one, but idk. It's not necessarily that people are terrible - there are plenty good and bad people out there - my mind just didn't see past certain aspects in the same light (platonic).

Interesting article about how single people tend to be more charitable and more happy than couples.,"[The whole thing is really interesting from an aro point of view, but this point stuck out at me:](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/living-single/201810/the-rise-single-people-why-some-find-it-scary)

&gt;Single people — or at least the ones with sufficient resources — have choices about how to live their lives. They *could* have said, to the rest of the world — “screw you, I’m doing what I want and I don’t care about you.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But here’s the thing: [They didn’t.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/living-single/201702/unselfish-singles-they-give-more-time-money-and-care) On the average, single people are the ones tending to their friends and neighbors and siblings and [parents](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/basics/parenting). They are the ones showing up when other people need help.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the average, it is the couples who [move in together or who get married](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/living-single/201201/slighting-friends-and-family-do-couples-become-less-couple-y-over-time)who look at each other and say, “*We* are the world. Everyone else can just take care of themselves.” Again, these are just averages, and plenty of single people stick to themselves and plenty of married people take care of people other than each other. But on the whole, it is [marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/basics/marriage), not single life, that is a threat to “the wants and needs of others, or of society as a whole.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Sociologists have a name for this. They call it “greedy marriage.” Marriage sucks up all the caring and the attentiveness and the resources all for itself.

It certainly makes sense to me - couples are conditioned to divert all emotional energy into one another and their children, the the point that my mum basically told me once that adults don't have any really emotionally intimate friends because your partner is supposed to do all of that :/ By comparison, aros tend to spread their emotional energy among many different kinds of people.

It was also really nice to see that apparently single people AREN'T totally lonely and miserable all the ime like I always kind of thought. Apparently single people tend to be less lonely and more happy on average! Obviously this is just a few studies of averages, but I really didn't expect it and it's kind of a relief to know that if I do end up single it might not be as bad as I thought? But that's just me!

"How to describe a ""sexy"" person?","For context, if needed: female asexual/Demiromantic (hetero)

I have been confused about something for years: there is a series of traits in other people that I recognize as aesthetically pleasing to me in particular, and in a specific way. I think of and refer to these traits as ""sexy."" I tend to be more open with people who have these traits unless something else about them puts me off. Usually these are traits in men, but sometimes girls too. 

I am *not* sexually attracted to these people, nor am I inherently romantically attracted to them. Like, my sister's fiancee has several of these traits and I would describe him as ""sexy"" but I am in no way ""interested"" in him. I am, in fact, specifically UNinterested in anything beyond friend and sibling-in-law. I have only somewhat recently realized that other people use this term to refer to traits that actually make them feel sexual attraction. 

But it's still different from ""oh, that looks good on you"" you know? Like, ""cute"" or ""nice"" or ""pretty/handsome"" are fundamentally different from ""sexy."" But I am not sexually attracted to a person because of those traits.

So.... How *should* I refer to these traits/people to get the point across more accurately? Do people think I want sexual contact if I call them sexy? Am I just super overthinking this? Does this make any sort of sense??",Asexual

My boyfriend and I broke up today because I don't want to have sex,"Before him, I had never been interested in anyone romantically, so I had never even tried to date, despite being in my mid 20s. So this was my first relationship.

Before this, I had never thought about my sexual orientation much, so I just assumed that I was picky and had a low libido. When I started dating my boyfriend I realized that I wasn't feeling things the way most people did, so I did some research and came to the realization that I was ace. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said from the beginning that sex was important to him and we agreed that we'd give it a shot. Since I had never dated before, I didn't know what I liked doing and what I didn't, so we wanted to try to see if I could like sex. We realized that I didn't want to have sex.

Comic Book Heroes,"This is going to sound kind of odd so bear with me. I need to rant about Jughead Jones from Riverdale, and I don't have anywhere else to do it.

When I was growing up I was pretty different from my friends romance-wise and I always felt like I was a little crazy. I had never heard of the term asexual, much less grey ace. I wondered if I was lesbian, since gay was the only word I knew to mean not wanting to have sex with men.

But then there was Jughead, this high school kid in a comic full of romantic drama and all he wanted was to hang out with his friends, eat pizza, play with his dog, be a detective, and fly around in outer space. I finally had someone I could relate to. Yeah in a couple of the side comics he dated girls, but he never chased them around and they always felt more like partners in crime, just like my first relationship was. When one of his writers came out a few years ago and said he was asexual and had been all along, I felt so vindicated.

Then Riverdale came out and now he's a big sex symbol. I know it can't take away what that character did for me growing up, but there were a million other characters they could have chosen from that series to sex up that would have actually fit the character. It just makes me so frustrated that there are so few asexual symbols out there, especially ones who are portrayed as having normal emotions and now this one is gone.

I'm obsessing over asexuality. What do I do?,"I haven't been on AVEN or any ace subreddit at all for a little while now because I decided to take a little break for my mental health. In fact, I took a break from asexuality as a whole, and tried to not even think about it. However, not only did this not help my mental health, I also wasn't able to get asexuality off my mind. I thought about it frequently, and brought it up even when I knew I shouldn't. I feel like I'm obsessed, and like this is how it's been ever since I started. 

I've been questioning my sexuality for nearly a year now, and it all started when I did some research for a reason I've long since forgotten, and I related to it. I eventually labeled myself as ace and came out to most people I knew, but then doubt set in, and it's been like that for a while. It's gotten a little better, but it's still very much there. Normally I'd paste in a long couple of paragraphs about how I feel and why I think I am (not) ace, but after having many people give their input I don't think that's going to get me anywhere. I honestly don't even know if that's how I feel anymore, or what I'm even feeling now.

I think that I should take a new approach, but I don't know what to do. Finding this out is very important to me, and I think I may need to tackle it head-on, but I'm not sure how. I just can't get this off my mind! Agh!",Asexual
"Given that sexual connection is apparently so amazing and wonderful that Allo's suffer significant mental and emotional distress when they can't get it, how am I to conclude that Asexuals, who are unable to experience this connection, are anything but flawed and inferior?","Now I know what you're thinking: didn't think guy make [a top thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/9mqdva/i_find_it_really_difficult_to_not_resent_an/) bashing Allo's just yesterday? What's all this about? 

The answer to that question is yes, I did indeed make that thread, and I meant everything I said at the time. You were all fantastic hosts and I felt really supported and understood, so thank you for that. However, I also made this [exact same thread over at AVEN](https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/177089-i-find-it-really-difficult-to-not-resent-an-allosexual-person-whenever-i-read-about-them-choosing-sex-over-their-relationship/), and let's just say they were nowhere near as supportive as you guys were. They were, however, very convincing, albeit not of the point that they intended. I highly suggest you don't try to read that thread: it's very long and there's a lot of flip flopping, so I'll just give a summary.

The thread started much like this one, although instead of support, I received disagreement and condemnation. This continued for a while until I eventually conceded that, while allo's sexual needs may be legitimate, I didn't have to respect them or not consider them to not be a flaw. I expected the thread to basically end there, but it did not. The arguments continued, and my resolve on even that new stance weakened. It eventually came to the point where I was forced to admit that Allo's sexual needs were a natural byproduct of how fantastic and enriching sex was in their lives. From there, is was 1 short hop to wondering: if sex really is so fantastic and enriching but Aces aren't capable of appreciating it, how are we not worse than allo's? They did not appreciate that connection, and a new wave of arguments emerged. At this point, the tide had turned so far against me that I became extremely defensive and started saying some really inflammatory things, which resulted in the thread being locked. 

My stance, however, remains. Allos can say all they want that they don't consider asexuality to be lesser or inferior, but how many of them would ever choose to be asexual for themselves? I reckon very few. ""Good for thee but not for me"" is incredibly unconvincing. They may not have intended to turn me anti-asexual, but that's what their constant arguments and lack of support ended up doing. I can't but see being asexual as inferior now, and I don't know what can get me out of that. Maybe that makes me weak, but that's where I am now. 

As for you all, I would appreciate it if you didn't try to argue with what I just said. That's what they tried over at AVEN, and it only caused to dig my heels in even more. I frankly expect this thread to be locked just due to the acephobic title, but I digress. To anyone that is still here: Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a good night. ",Asexual
I find it REALLY difficult to not resent an allosexual person whenever I read about them choosing sex over their relationship.,"A bit of background: I'm ace, but I'm sex favorable, or at least I think I am. I haven't done it yet, but I'm more than open to the idea of a sexual relationship. I'm also perfectly fine with the idea of a sexless relationship if that's what my partner wants. For me, sex is something I think I would enjoy but nowhere near something I need in a relationship, which, forgive me if this sounds conceited, seems like the ideal attitude to have towards sex, period. 

With that in mind, whenever I read about an allosexual person choosing sex over their relationship, I can't help but get angry. This is true whether they're in a relationship with an Ace or another Allo person. Cheating, trying to pressure their partner into an open relationship, breaking up due to a lack of sex, and initiating sex against their partners wishes all count here. I understand that sex is a **need** for these people, but I have a really hard time respecting that need whenever it leads to them hurting the people they care about and have committed themselves to. And frankly, I'm not even entirely convinced it's a need from a biological standpoint, but rather a cultural construct caused by society telling people for the past 60 years that sex is the most important thing in the world, that sex is a huge part of your identity, that sex is how you express love, and a life without sex is a life not worth living.

 Every time I read about an allo choosing sex over their relationship, I can't help but imagine that they could have chosen differently, but didn't because they're selfish, awful people. I know that this thought is almost always ridiculous and untrue, but the feeling is still there and it won't go away. It's especially bad when the allo person makes it clear that they still really love and care for their partner and yet are still choosing sex instead of them. As an Ace, my feelings of empathy for their partner makes it impossible to feel anything positive for the the allo who is choosing sex over them, except, perhaps, a twinge of pity. And even that pity is problematic because it leads to inevitable feelings of superiority in me over the ""stupid sexual animal that can't help but be led around by their genitals"". I realize how awful and dehumanizing thoughts like that are, but they're there and they're not going away. I've thought about why that is quite a bit, and it's just a hunch, but I feel like I need to demonize allo's in this way because accepting their needs as legitimate makes the prospect of happy relationships for Aces feel hopeless and quickly leads to feelings of Asexual inferiority. As fucked up as it sounds, it feels like the choice is to either hate them or hate my asexuality, and I prefer to hate them.

I feel like I feel attraction, I have urges, but I don't want to actualize on them and I don't like having them. The closest thing I can compare to is maybe an eating disorder - my body wants food, but I don't want to actually eat.

This disconnect really bothers me. I don't know how it can be that I don't know what I want, but here I am. Porn arouses me in the same way that the smell of cooking food makes people hungry. It just feels like a physiological response, but my mind and/or self doesn't actually want it.

Problem with asexuality,"I'm not new to asexuality.

Because of my own situation (stay tuned, will explain! lol) I've been active on Aven and another asexual forum I won't name.

Anyway,

There is a serious problem with the definition of asexuality- ""no sexual attraction""

I'm sure a few problems with it popped into your head immediately- but I mean, specifically

that a person who feels sexual attraction to others but still has no desire to have sex with them (not celibacy where you self deny, but actual no interest despite said attraction) can not be called an asexual- YET-

a person who doesn't feel sexual attraction, but actually WANTS TO HAVE SEX with other people, for WHATEVER REASON-

CAN be called an asexual.

This is nonsensical and seems to have come about because of the effort to get legal/political recognition of asexuality. In order to do this, asexuality must be an orientation- and an orientation can only be what you are attracted to, *period.*

And so what asexuality should actually represent has been seriously bastardized just to gain political power.

As you might have guessed, I fall into the: *a person who feels sexual attraction to others but still has no desire to have sex with them (not celibacy where you self deny, but actual no interest despite said attraction)* Healthy as a horse, doctor confirmed, by the way. Not sex repulsed- the intimacy in it is awesome. Just not interested, don't want to do it. Thanks, I'm good- seriously, you're mad hot, but no please. Don't ask me how a person is this way. But I'm 36. Took a long time to realize I wasn't going to grow out of it. Tried everything. Now I don't know why I even tried, other than having an endless questioning curiosity that has to test everything into dust. Well, tested and confirmed- GRADE A, DON'T WANT TO BANG YOU even though you may very well turn me on

I've explained it to a friend before like this: ""When you smell pizza, look at pizza, you have desire for the pizza- even if you're full. But if you're full, you don't want to actually eat it. THIS IS ME AND SEX.""

Ok so i need help with this situation,"Ok so this is going to be a bit of a long one.

I’m not too far away from graduating, and in all this time i have not told my parents than i am asexual.

I have tried to drop hints, i’ve tried to be very obvious in the fact that i don’t want to have sex or have kids, and i’ve even gone as far as to say “i’m not gay” when they ask but purposefully not mention being strait to see if they would ask and make it ever so slightly easier to come out about it.

And I am very aware that i’m under no real obligation to come out, however, i do feel the need to do it to avoid suddenly dumping years worth of secrecy to my parent.

So the reason i feel the need to come out is because I and someone i’ve known and grown close to for years now, plan on living together eventually. And knowing my parents expectations of having kids and them not knowing i’m ace is going to lead to quite a huge amount of misunderstanding, which i really want to avoid.

And to avoid this misunderstanding i need to come out, preferably in 3-4 months max.

So my question is... how?

Sexual attraction is rare for me. I only want relationships with other women (either cis or trans). I have experienced sexual desire (for women) in the past, but separate this from sexual attraction. I've only had one romantic/sexual relationship in the last 10 years, with my current girlfriend: ""Kay"". 

I deeply enjoy spending time with Kay, and that relationship does have a sexual component. We took 6 months of dating before I was sure I wanted to be in a relationship with her. She is also polyamorous (I'm okay with that) but I'd never been in a poly relationship before. I think I was mostly romantically attracted to her to begin with, and definitely wanted to progress beyond a close friendship: we have a huge amount in common, and really connected on an emotional level. She was also enormously patient with me in figuring all that out. :)

I'd only previously had one brief (teenaged) relationship which was damaging as that partner cheated on me (which I was in denial of– that was a decade ago though). Over the next 6 or so years, I was often lonely but wasn't able to find another partner. I pushed away one girl who was interested in me, and asked another out who wasn't.

I came out as trans in 2016 and started hormones in 2017. Since then my sexual arousal has tanked, which feels great because it was always something I'd considered inconvenient. I still enjoy being intimate with Kay, and we still have sex occasionally. My feelings around that are complex because although I enjoy sex with her I don't know how much I need it to be part of that relationship– unlike the cuddles and hand-holding, which I very much do need! 

My realisation of possibly being grey-ace started when I started going out with another woman, ""Dee"". I have no sexual attraction to her (at all) but I like her and went out with her a few times anyway. I thought that just like the beginning of my relationship with Kay, attraction might be something that comes later. And I think I am romantically attracted to Dee: I can see myself being close with her in that way (enjoying cuddles and holding hands), just not in a sexual way.

I backed out of that relationship a couple of months ago. We'd just gone beyond the hand-holding stage, but when we kissed it became clear to me that Dee wanted a sexual relationship and I didn't. It felt like a lie and I couldn't keep it up. We're still good friends though.

I initially confused my feelings around breaking up with Dee with the relationship being a polyamorous one. I find it difficult to imagine cheating on a partner, especially as I've been cheated on in the past. As I've rarely experienced sexual attraction, the idea that someone would break the terms of an existing relationship seems crazy to me. Kay was absolutely fine with me seeing other people though: she has other partners, and we'd discussed this multiple times. 

I also wanted to make sure that I wasn't seeing Dee just to fill the holes in my relationship with Kay. We only get to see each other about once a week, and I still get lonely. Because there was no sexual attraction there, it was easy to tell myself that I was just seeing Dee to fill that need. But that would ignore the fact that I did see myself being with her romantically.

**tl;dr**: I currently identify as lesbian but I can't think of any women who I'm attracted to primarily because I would want to have sex with them (including Kay, who has so much more!). I'm not sex-repulsed though. My recent experiences make me think I might be Ace and would explain a lot of my history. Started reading about Ace identity, which eventually brought me here. 

I guess I'm seeking a bit of validation from people who identify as ace too. (Not interested in any invalidation of the other L/T bits of my identity which I am sure about though, in case that wasn't clear 😉)... Can you give me some words to try to describe myself?",Asexual
How do you feel about seeing nudity/being nude?,"Personally, I hate it. I don't mind seeing shirtless people of any gender, but seeing people without pants freaks me out.

I was thinking about this today when my manager told me that she was uncomfortable with nudity and seeing naked men as a teenager but got used to it when she was older. She framed this as a normal thing that humans experience, but I've never gotten over my disgust at naked bodies/sexual organs. 

I just wondered if ace people tended to be less comfortable with nudity than others, or if this is a ""me"" issue. I also really hate the idea of anyone looking at me without clothes on. Blech.",Asexual

Asexuality As Tied to Identity...,"So, I used to identify as asexual, and aromantic to boot.  For a while I considered myself a ""triple a battery"" (Aromantic, Asexual, and Agender) but as I started to come to terms with my actual gender (a trans man) my relationship with my sexuality changed as well.  I now consider myself both homoromantic and homosexual, as my sense of self has solidified and I've been able to pass better, I find myself actually wanting relationships with other men.  But unlike a lot of people I've heard have the same experience as me with asexual being a 'step along the way' to a final orientation, I don't think that devalues asexuality at all, and I can't imagine how it would!  Asexual gave me a way to find normalcy in not desiring to be intimate with anyone, even if it turned out in my case to be the result of hating my body and presentation.  Just wanted to pop in and share this about myself, and wonder if anyone's still running around here with a similar experience?",Asexual
Unsure if I'm ace,"I've been on and off wondering if I'm asexual for a while. I don't feel like I experience arousal or attraction on a regular basis. I can appreciate if a celebrity or someone is attractive, but I don't feel a urge to have sex with them. I don't even know them. I am married and do enjoy sex though.

I've noticed a lot of people posting on this sub will describe different situations. Part of what confuses me is that in all these different situations, each poster will be told they are ace. Perhaps I just need to learn more about the different degrees on the spectrum.

The other factor confusing me is that I've been trying to quit porn. R/pornfree describes a situation called ""flatlining"" where people quitting porn experience periods where they feel little to no libido as their brains readjust from being aroused by images on a screen to real life.

I guess my question is how would I know if I''m ace or just ""flatlining""? Or could it be a little of column A and a little of column B?",Asexual
I feel I'm Asexual unless I'm very drunk...does that make any sense what so ever??,"The only time I have ever felt sexual attraction, the desire to kiss or to be sexually intimate with someone is when I'm very drunk.

I'm just a little confused about myself,"Just to preface, I want to say that I'm not really in distress about this or even sad about this. I'm just a little confused as to where I am in my journey of finding myself and what I should do next. Anyway, I'm not really sure what to do now. In the past I've doubted myself quite a bit and asexuality was something that was quite often on my mind, but it just isn't that much anymore. The only instances where I consistently think about it is whenever I see something that makes me doubt myself, which is quite frequent (in fact maybe me doubting myself so often and seeing things and people that make me question again and again is a sign I'm not ace, but I digress). But besides that, it's not on my mind that much and it doesn't feel as pressing as it once did. I feel like I'm not caring quite as much anymore, even though I want to care. I want to be comfortable and completely confident in my own sexuality, though right now it just doesn't feel like I need to resolve that. It's like I'm feeling two different things, or want to feel one thing but actually feel another. Like sometimes I feel like I should be sad or worried about all this but I'm not, so I think I may be bringing those feelings on myself. I'm just confused now as to where I am or what to do. As for context I'll have links to previous posts on AVEN [here](https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/176034-i-dont-know-what-i-need-or-what-to-do/) and [here](https://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/174766-my-journey-so-far/).

Questioning a flip-flopping sexuality (possibly a result of my hormone imbalance),"Background: I have a hormone imbalance (progesterone) that gives me amenorrea (absent periods), but I take progesterone pills every few months to get a period. Recently, I have been wondering what my rom/sexuality, since it is a time of change for me where I'm making more friendships and possibly romantic relationships. 


I keep switching between being very repulsed by romance (ex, when I can tell a guy friend wants to ask me to ""hang out"" aka possibly go on a date, or something more physical like kissing), to kind of enjoying it (ex, I had a dream that someone kissed me on the cheek and I loved that, and the other day someone hugged/held me in a semi-romantic way which I enjoyed). On the other hand, I am not at all repelled by sex, and I sometimes enjoy pornography and masturbation, but sometimes I will go without any masturbation/masturbation-type thoughts for weeks (possibly triggered by hormone supplements, or lack thereof). On the other hand, I am strongly repulsed by kissing and oral sex (especially when I think about myself doing it). 


In terms of crushes, I find many people very attractive or at least cute, even if other people do not think so, but any person who I think might be attracted by me makes me romantically and sexually repelled from them. 


I am wondering, 

- 1.) What kind of asexual, or greysexual (maybe?) might I be?

- 2.) Do you think my hormone imbalance contributes to this strange combination of rom/sexuality?

- 3.) Do you have any advice on dealing with relationships, or dealing with changing sexualities?

Am I asexual or just uncomfortable with sex?,"[M/20] Hello, I've already written like three posts about me questioning my sexual orientation but why not another one...

I've had sex with many people and it's absolutely disgusting, I could reach orgasm but I don't think it means anything.

I do like masturbating (ie on my own).

Maybe I still would like to be more normal and have sex (because all the people I've met/dated want that), and maybe the problem is that I've never felt comfortable enough to 'feel', I'm always rather shy and don't like having physical contact with anyone, at all.

"Holy shit, I JUST understood why I never understood the movie trope about there not being a 'spark'.","Whenever a person in a movie or on TV declared that there just wasn't a spark between them and their date, it always used to just irritate me.

If you enjoyed spending time together, and your values coincided, what more do you need?!

And my mum would always say: ""Love doesn't always make sense!""

But it still didn't make sense to me. These people did seem to really like their dates! And people are always able to list of reasons why they love someone - ""You're so kind and genuine and you were really there for me in my time of need!"" - so that still felt like an excuse. Writing your characters just not having any feelings for someone who is clearly perfect for them, without it being a bad time or anything, just felt like bad writing!

Been trying to figure myself out.,"Warning: this is mainly just a massive brain dump trying to figure myself out. Need to get it off my chest but don't want to talk about it to anyone I know and this seems like the right place. Hope it's okay. Second warning: my language is fucking terrible. 


I'm 26, male. I'm finally figuring out I'm something.

My cock works and does its thing and I masturbate from time to time but get nothing out of it. Honestly I've always thought I'm just broken but that's what people do so I should do it also. It's always been a chore though. 

I've had sex a fair bit since turning eighteen. The first time I had sex I jokingly described it as ""a posh wank with effort"" because I didn't get a lot out of it. I do get sexual arousal but only if I have a strong emotional bond with someone so maybe I'm demisexual but more than anything I've done the sex because I thought that was something I'm supposed to do. 

The first sexual relationship I had, the relationship pretty much fell apart after nine months because I had no interest in sex. Shortly after that whilst struggling with depression I ended up in a sex-only relationship for about a year because I figured that's what I was supposed to do. There's been a few times I've slept with people after that because I was struggling mentally and it just made me feel wanted/needed (pretty certain I was a major jerk for that). I think I enjoy the intimacy but the physical act of sex I don't really enjoy at all. I don't hate it, I just am not interested and don't feel anything from the physical act.

A couple of years after that I met someone who is an Ace and we had an asexual relationship for a year. That was awesome. I truly loved her (think I do still) and would get arousal from being with her but again wasn't bothered by the idea of the physical act of sex (though occasionally I do find myself wanting the release (again, demisexual?).

That relationship ended a year ago when she moved halfway round the world.

I have been on tinder this past year; I'm definitely heteromantic: that's what I do know for certain. Just used it to see if I met anyone I may have a mental connection with. Nothing really came of it until a few weeks ago when I met someone and we went on a couple of dates. We were back at hers and one thing lead to another. It was the first time in three years and I learned only one thing from it and that was I have zero interest in the act. I really do get nothing out of it - didn't enjoy it and was kind of waiting for it to end. I realised I don't even get that endorphin high.

Anyway I've been thinking about this for the last two weeks ands working myself out. Putting two and two together as it's really something I've never thought about before other than figuring there's something wrong with me because I'm not in that 99% of ""normal"".

"CW: Sexual Assault, Sex, etc. My Boyfriend is asexual but I am not...(need advice)"," My trans (ftm) boyfriend is asexual, however, I am not. We have been together on and off for a few years now but we recently moved in together and got more serious. We have a sexual past together when he was more comfortable with sex before he was sexually assaulted for the second time. Since then he hasn't been comfortable at all with sex. He has a long history of being sexual abused too. So obviously sex is off the table. During his second sexual assault he went out and tried being a dom for a stranger he met on the bus and he assaulted my boyfriend. He was desperate for money and I couldn't help him because I had recently given him a couple hundred and I was out too. This event was is the main reason he can't have sex anymore. It was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't know if it is wrong or not for me to be a little angry with my boyfriend for doing something so stupid and ruining our sex life and chances of being intimate. Obvious I am infinitely more angry at the man that did this to him. I still feel like my boyfriend should have known not to go to a stranger's apartment by himself or told me what he was going to do before he had done it. I still blame myself for not having more money. If I did I could have saved him from that trauma. Nevertheless here we are, he's asexual (probably for good) and I still have urges to be with him. Somewhere inside me sex is important to me. I don't know why but it feels like something you do to show love or bond with your partner. I know there are other ways of showing love but this still feels really important and I don't know how to move past it. I know my partner won't have sex and won't be comfortable with any alternatives either. Basically if it's sexual he won't do it. I want some advice of how to move past and accept he isn't comfortable and it's for his happiness, even if it means giving up some of mine.",Asexual

Now I'm kinda concerned as it feels a little bit like the butterflies have worn off a bit and I'm not totally sure how to put my feelings into words here.  I still enjoy hanging out with her but I still don't fully understand what makes a relationship so special or different from a friendship.  This might just be because we're both new to the relationship thing so we haven't really had any physical contact but at the moment it just feels like we slapped the boyfriend and girlfriend labels on each other and we're waiting for things to progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel super guilty since I can't understand why I don't feel as excited or nervous to see her anymore.  Maybe part of it is that I've grown to feel comfortable around her and I've allowed myself to be comfortable acting a little more reserved but I have a fear inside that I'm not as interested as before and I'm doing the wrong thing.

I'm so jealous of lesbians for having a culture.,"Sorry, this is probably a dumb post, but this just keeps hitting me all the time and I wondered if anyone else could relate.

For ten years, I identified as just bi. On a number of occasions, the idea of being ace hit me, but I mostly set it aside, because the idea of bisexuality just felt so good to me and I felt like I belonged so much around other bi people. And it was such a nice community, full of friendly people treating each other equally regardless of gender or anything else. But, there always was that annoyance in me that gay people often seemed to view bisexuals as lesser. There were all kinds of nice bi jokes and stereotypes and things that we could make into our common language, but there were so many gay ones that would fit as well, that I was never sure I could entirely claim. I remember being so weirdly happy when the Bisexual Haircut joke came about - it was nice to just have that for ourselves, y'know?

But as time went on, I started to realise that I probably actually was asexual, and possibly aro, too. And that... was such an awful, isolating feeling. I already felt like I couldn't connect to normal people - I'm a massive introvert with ADHD/ASD leanings (I am literally incapable of feeling completely comfortable when another person is around, I can only feel totally relaxed by myself), and at the time I'd recently graduated university and was having absolutely 0 luck finding anyone who wanted me to work for them. The idea of losing even that, too - that which so many people claim makes us human - was terrifying, and the practical consequences only seemed even worse. My mum has said to me once that adults can't ever really have close friends outside of their partner, because everything becomes about your partner and kids when you grow up. I tortured myself thinking about that for months. Was I just going to be alone forever? And I actually really wanted kids (still do) - how could I possibly take care of them on my own? Hell, in a world which assumes dual incomes, how on earth could my unemployed ass even survive...? (Luckily I have a trainee job now so that's partially mollified...)

More than anything, all I needed was to have a place where I could belong. Where I could feel part of something. A place where we could make dumb jokes and claim things for ourselves (jokingly, of course) and emphasise over and over This Is Us: We Belong Together. For so long, that'd been the queer community, which had been perfect for that. No matter what I did, I was queer, and every time someone made a joke about something being gay I kind of sat back, knowing there were people who had my back and wanted things for me in the world. (Apart from the occasional 'bi people shouldn't say they're gay!!"" lesbians but they really did feel like a minority.)

And then... ace discourse happened. Suddenly, all aces were scavengers trying to steal resources from gay people. Anytime an ace person brought up their identity, they were butting in with things that don't matter, or even making gay people feel uncomfortable. They were harrassed out of taking part in queer things, and any things aces did try to claim, were even mocked, or harrassed for taking something that 'belongs' to lesbians. (See: one time someone was making pride themed soaps based on mythology, and chose Artemis for a-specs, only to be harrassed by lesbians because she was 'stealing from lesbians' because some already liked to interpret her as a lesbian.)

Childish and ridiculous? Yeah. But I just felt so alone in the world. I've always felt like I needed to be private about my thoughts and feelings because they were weird, and all this only magnified it. Hell, during this time I got super interested in the American Revolution (yes, through Hamilton, through this went way beyond that) - as a young Australian woman, I literally was never able to mention that in a way that didn't make people laugh, and it was just such a reminder of how different from everyone else I was.

This is really rambly and off topic, but the point is: there's such a strong lesbian identity that I am so, so jealous of. Lesbians can have lesbian hair and lesbian clothing and lesbian hobbies, where they go to meet other obvious lesbians, and talk about lesbian celebrities and lesbian movies and lesbian music, in buildings and neighborhoods specifically for lebians, where they can happily live our lesbian ideology and philosophy. There are lesbian words, lesbian jokes, lesbian terms that only lesbians are supposed to use, and any time something could vaguely relate to any of those things, or involves two girls being close in any way, that's a Lesbian thing for lesbians only and anyone who disregards that will be harrassed. (Girl dates a girl and we have no idea of her identity? She MUST be interpreted as a lesbian. And bisexuals are able to participate in this, but ONLY as long as they prioritise lesbians and act as much like lesbians as they can. Openly being attracted to men is right out.)

And I feel so bitter and awful because none of this is the fault of lesbians as a class or anything, but I'm just so fucking jealous. Even when people express hatred towards lesbians and bi women, it's recognisable as homophobia, and they can stand up and be proud of their identity and say 'that's wrong' without confusion and know there will be people behind them (I should know - that's always how I felt). I find myself constantly needing to convince myself that aphobia even exists, leaving me repeating stats to myself like Arya Stark, about rape statistic and housing discrimination and the like, just to feel like I'm not the bad guy. It's so awful to be gaslit by the world like this, told you don't even exist, mocked for even suggesting that you're suffering, having everything good and enjoyable ripped away from you. I just want to feel like I'm real, you know? I've disassociated so much just because I felt so disconnected from everything and everyone else in the world because I never seemed to react to anything the same way as them...

And I know it's weird to be writing this here because this is an asexual community! And I'm extremely grateful for it and trying to involve myself more in it. But it's so TINY. There are so few of us. We were always part of the LGBT+ community, so we're so heavily tied, but now that I feel like I'm not welcome in some of those parts, I don't know what to do. We were meant to uplift each other as a community, but looking back, it feels like it's always been aspecs lifting up the first letters in the acronym, and getting little more than an occasional 'so yeah aces exist, pretty wild huh?' article back. (And, again, I've done literal volunteer work for LGBT+ rights, so I'm not just whining here.) And I still feel so fucking embarrassed over any fun aspec thing, like space ace aesthetics, or squishes, or QPPs (even though I literally am in one, but I feel such cringe over it I can't actually explain my own relationship to anyone :( ).

I just...wish there was a well-known aspec culture, you know? Something that could make me feel 'Yes, I'm a-spec, and I'm proud of that, because aces and aros are great people who deserve good things!' (And fuck, the fact that I don't even know exactly whether I'm aro or not doesn't help either because the current discourse also seems to be 'if you take part in things for an identity you don't belong to, fuck you, you're a fetishising invader' which has made me so scared to even approach aro things...) Something that could make me feel like who I am isn't only bad and unfortuante things. That there is a group I can belong to proudly and claim and express. Anything.",Asexual

I feel weird because I still desire sex. I just don't really desire it with one specific person. Is this normal for asexual people? My experience is limited and from what I've seen, it isn't. Like I said though, my experience is very limited, so I have no idea.

I've also heard most asexual people find pornography gross and don't really masturbate. I don't find it gross and I masturbate regularly. I get off just as well without it though, which is not the same as what I've heard from some other teenagers on a certain subreddit I'm active on. (Sorry if this section was a little TMI)

Again, I'm really sorry if any of this seems insensitive.

I also wonder if my feelings are just being blocked because of my situation irl, which is, to say the least, stressful.

I guess, how do you know? 

Also, do you think I'm asexual? I saw the pinned post describing different types of asexuality. If you think I am, what type do you think I am?

And I know no one can really answer this except for me. I just feel so lost and I'd love some advice.

Thanks everyone",Asexual
I don't know what I need or what to do.,"So, just to preface this I know I've been posting a lot and this may seem a little repetitive, so I'm sorry about that. I'm also not sure exactly what to say or how to word it, so I apologize if it's a little difficult to read. I just kinda want to say that I'm not sure where I am in my journey now or what I need to do. My ultimate goal is to be comfortable and confident in my sexuality, whatever that is. However I can't seem to get there. If I investigate I often end up obsessing and not trusting myself, but even when the doubt caused by this isn't so bad, I still can't move on. I'm anxious if I identify with something that I'm not 100% confident in, but then I also need a label, so I can't go without one. I also feel like whatever doubt I have left is brought on by myself. Like I'm trying to hold myself back, and I won't allow myself to accept myself for whatever reason. I mean like I should be sad and distressed about it, but I'm not. It's almost like I want to feel that way sometimes. Luckily it feels like that's weakening on me, but I still want to be confident, and that leaves me in a sort of limbo. I don't know where to go and what to pursue in order to be more confident. I feel okay now but a part of me says that it's not right. I don't want to continue not really caring. When people ask I want to be able to say with as much certainty as possible that ""I am asexual/heterosexual (whatever I end up being)."" The thing is though, I don't know what's going to let me do that. I don't have something that ""once this or that happens, I can use that to better determine what I am."" It's been 9 months, I've talked to a bunch of people, and after reading my self summary (below) 32 people over the course of my posts have said I'm ace, yet I still feel like I'm not allowing myself to move on. I just don't know what I need to accept myself, or even what to do. It's just confusing. I feel fine but I shouldn't. I should be doubtful thinking about all this but I'm not. I just don't know...

As usual, I'll provide a little c﻿ontext as to my experiences, if it's any help. When it comes to relationships, my two crushes (the only ones I've ever had) were purely romantic, and all I desired was the emotional aspect. Sex really isn't an aspect I want in a relationship, and in my vision of a perfect relationship sex is absent. I ﻿can recall thinking why people would ruin a perfectly good relationship with sex, though I can understand why people do it now. When it comes to other things though, I do have a libido, and masturbate, though I know that it doesn't really matter all that much. I usually only do it because I'm bored. If I ever use visuals I don't concentrate on who's doing what, but rather what's being done. It's more of the act than anything else. If I have any sort of fantasy, it's not about any specific person, but an anonymous figure, though I can but a person in there, it just doesn't really add anything. If it's someone I know pe﻿rsonally, or a stranger where there's no sexual aspect to whatever image I'm looking at, it feels weird to me. If it﻿﻿'s a stranger that has some sort of sexual thing happening then I can substitute them there but nothing really changes. There's also this weird feeling. I can get this feeling out of nowhere, where my heart rate increases and I can sometimes get this weird tingling ""down there"" (though it's definitely not anywhere close to﻿ full arousal, if it's arousal at all). This can occur from physical proximity or looking at someone (often with people I guess I'd find aesthetically attractive, though I don't actively﻿ think of them as such). My thoughts don't really line up with it, and I'm usually just thinking about the fact that I'm feeling something. It's a little jarring, I guess. It also goes away very quickly. If it makes any difference though, I am 15 and thus hormones may pay a part.

When I was younger, I used to get that same﻿ feeling, albeit stronger, when looking at people, but at it's strongest I'm pretty sure there was a clear trigger. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the trigger was bra straps for me (oof this is kinda embarrassing), and that's when it would be at it's strongest. I would just get this urge to just kinda stare. If I'm being honest I'm not sure what I was thinking, though it was probably just on the bra straps. On top of that, I was also masturbating at this age, and I remember it feeling better when I was in a room with a lot of people I didn't know around my age, but I don't remember wanting to talk with any of them or wanting sex with them or anything, just that it would feel better than usual when I ""did the thing"" afterward. Though, I haven't felt a feeling that strong in a long time, and the thing with bra straps is completely gone. And I was pretty much smack dab in the middle of puberty there so hormones may have been a larger influence.

That should be it. I'm just not sure what to do with all this. I don't know if the concept of all this is compatible with my worldview, since I view things in black and white a lot even when it's not, like here, or what I even want at this point. I'm also really confused as to all these feelings, or in this case lack thereof. Something is telling me that when I'm typing this I should be sad, confused, and doubtful, but I'm not. It's like I'm numb to them, I don't know how to describe it. I just feel like I'm aimlessly typing away, searching for advice and I answer that I feel I want but at the same time I'm not sure of. Should I aim to be more confident? Is this ever going to end? What should I do?",Asexual
“Ace” whole new world,"I don’t really know where else to bring thing, I’m a female in my 20s and lately I’ve found identifying as asexual is really comfortable for me, the issue I have is explaining it to other people and I don’t know, maybe I’m just looking for validation, but essentially this:

I do have sex frequently and when I have sex I’ve enjoyed the connection I made with those I’ve had sec with;
However, I always felt bad after and even before, I noticed my “sexual desire” came more from a need of validation or even insecurity, I started paying more attention to myself and I realized I don’t feel the actual need or sexual motivation/desire for sex personally.

I don’t mind sometimes, just having sex with the people I’m seeing when they want it, it’s just important that they understand where I am on it and that when I say no, I mean no. One guy described it like he felt as if He was a rapist if he knows I don’t want to have sex even if I’m doing it anyway, it hurt a lot; I tried to explain to him that I like the connection that sex can provide I just don’t have a hormone crazed libido, there’s a whole lot I can get into about it but this text is already long enough.

What to do when people accuse you of being gay in denial?,"I'm a naturally feminine guy and so many people accuse me of being gay in denial. I really want to be clear to people and get them to understand! It really hurts when people refuse to believe I am who I am just because they've never met an ace person before.

EDIT: Thank you all a lot for the helpful replies!! I'll try to apply them more often. So in conclusion, make light of it, be clear to them, and make sure they process your feelings on the matter.

Please learn from me,"I hate that I feel like I need to warn people. Please find someone who respects your boundaries.
My boyfriend had cheated on me.... Twice (technically three times) the first time I told myself it was because I was asexual and was holding off on him. The second time he brought condoms and lube, even though I told him explicitly I didn't want to do anal (gay couple). He made it seem like an impulse buy but later confessed it was to, and I quote ""get you comfortable with those things"". We broke up three days after he told me. I was disgusted at first just by his lack of respect for the boundary I set, but then I looked at other times. He had used reverse psychology to get me to blow him after trying to push me down to his cock didn't work (I'm small and he was stronger). After the first time he cheated I hadn't let him blow me and was uncomfortable with it, but after I felt like it was my fault and his incessant pestering and coercion, I gave in. Once he finished he wanted me to do him and I was laying down and he dragged his dick across my face and stopped short of just opening my mouth on his own. The same thing happened with kissing. He tired to kiss me on our first date and I rejected it, he stopped and didn't try again. But the next date he would brush his lips against mine and in return I would make sure they were closed at tight as possible. He would have his lips to mine and would poke out with his tongue, after realizing I wasn't gonna open he would back off, but then try again within the hour. Once he asked why I wouldn't kiss him and made it seem like I was the one doing something bad. Later that day I made myself let him make out with me. And I didn't even see any of the warning signs. He would initiate things and I would think, 'oh, now? I wanted to watched the show' (we would literally Netflix and chill and I'm kinda grossed out). But I regret how I didn't stand up for myself and just feel gross and unclean sometimes. I was adamant about not being penetrated by anything and I just wish I had that confidence to refuse to do the other things.... He told me he understood but then moved forward, barely asking me. And I hate that I thanked him, forgetting how I actually was so stressed and uncomfortable I was when he first blew me, or how gross I can find kissing.
TL: DR. I dated a guy who said he understood and would respect my boundaries but instead undercut them and cheated on me",Asexual
Very strange experience with ace friend,"So a group of friends and I were hanging out last Sunday night at Julie's house. For context, we are a group of 6 friends who often have catch ups at her place. We are all quite open and accepting of each other. There are two aces, Julie and Anne.

Julie mentioned that she found this hilarious porn video the other day and she wanted to show us. After we asked how she found it, she said she was searching something along the lines of ""how to have sex"" (she's 30 but often comes across quite innocent). 

So we all went upstairs to chill in the living room in front of her big screen and after a quick search she found the video. It was just as described, an explicit video about how to have sex. She found the narration highly amusing and we also laughed a bit, but the novelty soon wore off and we ended up awkwardly watching porn for 15 minutes before Anne said she found the video uncomfortable so Julie quickly switched it off. Julie was a bit confused as to why we all didn't find it as hilarious as her.

Another time several weeks prior we were all looking on Netflix for a movie to watch and Julie mentioned that she couldn't believe how pornographic the movie Below Her Mouth is. I said it isn't really pornographic as it isn't as explicit but she was pretty adamant so we all ended up watching the whole thing. This wasn't really awkward though as it's a decent movie.

As I said, we are all quite open with each other and talk about everything from mental health to sexuality. Sometimes we have nude spa parties when our nudist friend joins us. Julie often suggest playing truth or dare which gets weird but fun in a strange sexual/non-sexual way.

I think we're all a bit confused by Julie, even she seems to be. One time she suggested she might not be asexual after all, but later changed that opinion and reaffirmed that she is definitely asexual/sex repulsed. She sometimes questions me about what being sexual is like, yet she has said before that she sometimes has elusive moments of sexuality that disappear just as quickly.

We all love her and this isn't a post criticising her, I just thought this community might find all this interesting.

I feel like I just can’t accept myself.,"So, I know that I posted here not too long ago, but I think I should post this. I’ve been thinking that my doubt my just be something I bring on myself, and I’m just refusing to accept myself. I mean the doubt I have now isn’t the same as when I first had it, now I just sort of have it, but I’m not in distress or anything. I just kinda feel it there, but now I’m not sure if that’s there because I’m putting it there. I want to comfortable with my sexuality, but when I try to work things out I don’t trust myself and get obsessive. I think that’s because I feel anxious labeling myself something that I’m not 100% sure about, even though I know that I may not feel that way ever again. The most that I can try doing is not caring, but I don’t want to do that forever. I want to get out of being able to hide from the asexuality, but I don’t know if I’m the one holding myself back, or what will break me free. I mean I’ve talked to people, done research, and I recently counted 32 people that said I’m ace (after reading my self summary, which is below), yet after that and 9 months I don’t have the confidence and pride that I want.

First time telling someone I know.,"So, I'm talking to this guy whose been pestering me to go on a date with him, but before I agree to anything I want to try telling him that I'm asexual. I've never told anyone before. I'm really nervous. 

What's a good way to tell someone? I really want to make sure I don't mess this up because we talk to each other more than anyone else, but I'm not sure how I feel. I want to see how he takes it, and then maybe see where things go from there.

I'm just not sure how to come out about it. 

Edit: I didn't tell him. He went on some rant about how awful women are, calling them liars and saying them not telling him things means they hate him. I'm honestly devastated that he would say something like that to me. We've been friends for a long time and to see him say things like that just makes me mad, confused, and sad. 

I don't think I can tell him something like this without him reacting negatively. But now I wonder if I even want to be friends with him anymore. I told him its not fair for him to say things like that and he hasn't said a word to me since. I don't know what to think now.",Asexual

"I don't really know, I might be just terrible with relationships","Hello and thank you for reading this.

So, I'm a man, 28 years old,  I've had sexual relations with more than 10 different women, and  I've had a girlfriend once: we were together for 5 months and all we did was having sex every day we saw each other. We saw each other maybe 4 times a week.

So the first thing I want to talk about is about her. She was my first and only girlfriend, when I was 26; I'd seen here a lot of times before we knew each other because we were always in the same parties, but I never had the courage to talk to her. We only had sober sex once, and ir was awful. When I met her, her friends told me she was nymphomaniac, but I didn't really believe them because anyone can say that about women who like to have sex and do frequently. Eventually it turned really bad, all she wanted to do was having sex even when I told her I didn't wanted to and I broke up with her after a couple of ""rapes"".

All my other sexual relationships were with friends and drunk. I've had sober sex 2 times in my life. All of my sexual relationships were one time things because of regrets the next day, things were awkward or I just accomplished what I wanted, but I just wanted to have sex with them once, just because we were really close and they talked me about sex and how they would have sex with me.

I haven't had sex since I was with my ex, 2 years ago, and well, I don't know what to think. I masturbate almost once a day, and when I don't, I feel depressed, as if I should be having sex but I don't really like to/know how to(I don't even watch porn). There's this friend of mine who has a really high sex drive and we''ve had sex 3 times but all of them were awful, her being the one seducing me into it.

I don't really know how to act in the presence of women who flirt with me, I can't even know when it's happening and it's confusing. I've thought a lot of times if I might be asexual, but since I've had sex and some times I want to have sex with girl friends once I know they want/would have sex with me, I just become fixated with that thought, as I'm now with a friend who has a boyfriend but she has told me she would have sex with me, she's in a dead bedroom situation, she's been unfaithful to her boyfrind, and I've known her for 10 years and in the early years I had a crush with her.

Maybe I'm not asexual and you could help me pointing me in the right way. I'm a terrible persons anyway.",Asexual

Coming out??? Tips/suggestions and advice appreciated.,"About me: 25 year old cis female, gray-A, still determining my romantic orientation. I didn't consider myself on the asexual spectrum until I was 22. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've only officially come out to best friend very nonchalantly in a text message and we didn't discuss the topic any further. I'm considering coming out to two of my closest friends, but I'm afraid/nervous. I want to come out to them because I feel like it's something they should know about me and probably answer a lot of their questions related to the fact that I'm a virgin, never been kissed, or been in serious relationship. I've tried dating, but it never really seems to work out, probably because I have severe trust and commitment issues. I don't want to get married or have kids, but I'm not completely opposed to being in long term relationship. 

We also all live in different states. I would feel better telling them via text/writing, but I feel like it's something that should be said in spoken words and I have no idea when we all be together again. They deserve more than a text that reads: I'm asexual. I don't want to tell one in person and them keep it a secret before I can tell the other. Any suggestions on how to proceed with this? ",Asexual
How Flirting Works (it doesn't) and Other Miscommunications,"I'm ace, have pretty bad social anxiety, and to top it all off I can't tell if someone's flirting with me worth a damn.  The following stories are about the chaos that ensues:

        A few years ago, I went to a summer camp that was coed.  I got to be very good friends with this girl there who was just a year or two older than me.  Well, we were out talking and walking right before curfew (almost 10:00) when she directed me to behind the bathrooms.  Me being the fool I am, I followed along not thinking about why she wanted to go there.  To my great surprise she turns around and kisses me VERY aggressively ( a little tongue, a little nibble) for about five seconds.

Open relationship?,"Is there anyone, who identifies as ace, who is in an open relationship? I would love to hear your experiences/advice/thoughts.

My short story:
I [M] have been with my girlfriend for over 2 years. I feel she's my soulmate and we plan on spending the rest of our lives together. She is very sexually motivated but I am not. When we  first started dating we were intimate a lot. Now, we go long periods of time without having sex. I've been okay with it because sex is very overwhelming for me and is not something I think about or crave. She, on the other hand, is being highly effected by it. She says it's been the longest she's gone without it and is making her depressed. She wants me to be assertive and initiate, but I have no drive or interest, so nothing ever happens. She knows I've questioned my sexuality and we've talked about how I feel. We want to make things work. She brought up the possibilities of an open relationship. I could see this working because we are very open and honest with each other and I want her to have the things I feel I cannot provide and she does not want to cheat on me. I'm not completely sure how I feel about this but I do trust her and i know that I'm always going to be the one she comes back to. We both want to work for our relationship and make things work.

An Essay on How I Lose Friends as an Ace,"I remember lying there in the grass, looking up at the blue sky and the white clouds, lazing beside you, saying a lot of little nothings, when you bared yourself to me, pouring out over the itchy grass and gray clouds your heart’s desire: me.  Our friendship grew twisted, every joke an innuendo, every smile took a new form, every touch a new meaning—I couldn’t looking you in the eyes, there on that verdant field I panicked.  The windows to your soul un-shuttered, the secret to your soul uncovered, and I panicked.  I turned your confession, pretending it was another little nothing, freeing myself from your feelings.  I’m sorry.
	Now, I see the flash of apprehension in your eyes, the hiccup in your step when you see me.  You won’t come near me, because I hurt you.  I don’t even have the courage to acknowledge my failure, and only now have I unveiled myself.
	But is this my fault?  I told myself to you, told you that my love wasn’t lust—nothing about me is.  You knew my secret, my undesired for flesh, yet still you persisted, pursued.  Grabbing a rose by its thorns surely does not reflect poorly of the flower?
	Maybe this is the way it must be; you hurt, me confused, both lost.",Asexual
I almost feel like I'm kidding myself at this point.,"I feel like I should have no reason to doubt myself at this point. Like I've hit a point where I'm just completely kidding myself, that there's just too much evidence that I can't bring myself to accept, but it's still there. I've been at this for around 8 months, done a lot of research, talked to a lot of ace people, and like 25 people have said that I could easily be ace, yet I still doubt myself. I don't get it. Heck, I don't even know if what I'm feeling is doubt. It's definitely not as strong as it was before, and if people ask I say I'm ace (though I do sometimes bring up the fact that I'm not quite sure), but I'm still not quite sure myself.  I'll include some context (as I do pretty much all the time, I guess just in case it adds anything)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the context. Sorry if this is a little repetitive, since I have posted this next bit before.

As﻿ for some context as to how I feel, when it comes to relationships, my two crushes were purely romantic, and all I desired was the emotional aspect. Sex really isn't an aspect I want in a relationship, and in my vision of a perfect relationship sex is absent. I can recall thinking why people would ruin a perfectly good relationship with sex, though I can understand why people do it now. When it comes to other things though, I do have a libido, and masturbate, though I know that it doesn't really matter all that much. I usually only do it because I'm bored. If I ever use visuals I don't concentrate on who's doing what, but rather what's being done. It's more of the act than anything else. If I have any sort of fantasy, it's not about any specific person, but an anonymous figure, though I can but a person in there, it just doesn't really add anything. If it's someone I know personally, or a stranger where there's no sexual aspect to whatever image I'm looking at, it feels weird to me. If it's a stranger that has some sort of sexual thing happening then I can substitute them there but nothing really changes. There's also this weird feeling. I can get this feeling out of nowhere, where my heart rate increases and I can sometimes get this weird tingling ""down there"" (though it's definitely not anywhere close to full arousal, if it's arousal at all). This can occur from physical proximity or looking at someone (often with people I guess I'd find aesthetically attractive, though I don't actively﻿ think of them as such). My thoughts don't really line up with it, and I'm usually just thinking about the fact that I'm feeling something. It's a little jarring, I guess. It also goes away very quickly. If it makes any difference though, I am 15 and thus hormones may pay a part.  


When I was younger, I used to get that same feeling, albeit stronger, when looking at people, but at it's strongest I'm pretty sure there was a clear trigger. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the trigger was bra straps for me (oof this is kinda embarrassing), and that's when it would be at it's strongest. I would just get this urge to just kinda stare. If I'm being honest I'm not sure what I was thinking, though it was probably just on the bra straps. On top of that, I was also masturbating at this age, and I remember it feeling better when I was in a room with a lot of people I didn't know around my age, but I don't remember wanting to talk with any of them or wanting sex with them or anything, just that it would feel better than usual when I ""did the thing"" afterward. Though, I haven't felt a feeling that strong in a long time, and the thing with bra straps is completely gone. And I was pretty much smack dab in the middle of puberty there so hormones may have been a larger influence.  


That should be everything. Hopefully I get this figured out soon.

Being ace but having fantasies while masturbating?,"First off, I want to preface this by saying I'm really sorry I post so much. I kinda feel bad about it, especially after I get support from people on here. I feel like I have gotten slightly better, though stuff like this happens often and I slip into a brief doubt phase. 

So, I was thinking about this for a little while, and I just wanted to ask a quick question on it. I masturbate myself, though I often don't have any sort of fantasies. However, I did recently and was confused as to whether it would make me not asexual after all.

TMI WARNING BELOW:

Anyway, so when I was doing it, I had a sort of fantasy. As I approached the end, it happened. I was involved with it, though there wasn't any specific person there. Just me and an anonymous figure, I guess (which is normally the case for anything I have that's close to a fantasy) This left me very confused, as this one just sort of happened and was natural (which doesn't normally happen). It didn't feel weird or foreign. Now I'm just really confused as to this points to me not actually being asexual. I'll provide a little context below, if that makes any difference. (I have posted this before and just pasted it here since it's so long, just to let you know)

As for some context as to how I feel, when it comes to relationships, my two crushes were purely romantic, and all I desired was the emotional aspect.

If I ever use visuals I don't concentrate on who's doing what, but rather what's being done. It's more of the act than anything else (which I think is what my fantasy was mainly about, but I'm still confused). There's also this weird feeling. I can get this feeling out of nowhere, where my heart rate increases and I can sometimes get this weird tingling ""down there"" (though it's definitely not anywhere close to full arousal, if it's arousal at all). This can occur from physical proximity or looking at someone (often with people I guess I'd find aesthetically attractive, though I don't actively think of them as such). My thoughts don't really line up with it, and I'm usually just thinking about the fact that I'm feeling something. It's a little jarring, I guess. It also goes away very quickly. If it makes any difference though, I am in my mid teens and thus hormones may pay a part.

 When I was younger, I used to get that same feeling, albeit stronger, when looking at people, but at it's strongest I'm pretty sure there was a clear trigger.

I feel like I’ve been overthinking and lying to myself and haven’t really gotten anywhere.,"Okay﻿ so right now I've descended into one of my (pretty muc﻿h weekly at this point) phases of doubt, so this will probably be one of my longer posts. I guess I was just talking to some friends about some stuff, and I brought up this one feeling that I get (which I'll mention later) and they said that it sounded like some sort of attraction. When I brought up aesthetic attraction they said that they understood it, but it didn't sound like it t﻿hough. Then I just got confused and started spiraling down into doubt again. Sometimes I feel like if I have this doubt so much, it's a sign that I'm not actually asexual. I feel like I wouldn't be going through this much doubt if this actually was me, so I'm just overthinking everything and at the same time lying to myself. I have the urge to just completely give up and j﻿ust call myself straight now and forever. And I wish I didn't care this much, but I NEED a label. Life is an un﻿speakable eldritch horror without a label. I feel as if I ﻿﻿﻿no longer have control of part of myself, and the unce﻿rtainty that comes from it totally kills me.

My journey (so far),"When I first heard about the term asexual, I thought that it was synonymous with aromantic (though I didn't know the term at the time). I had no idea that one could be asexual and masturbate or want a relationship or anything like that. On top of that, I thought that I experienced sexual attraction. I'd look at people (usually because of stuff they were wearing) and just have the urge to stare, maybe get a small raise in heart rate. (I'll go more into detail on it later). I masturbated, though pretty much just out of boredom. I set up a deadline where I'd ""allow"" myself to have sex, and then everything would be all great, or so I thought. I had never liked anyone, but as far as I was concerned I was just as straight as could be.

Then high school started. During orientation I'm pretty sure I had my first crush, though I didn't accept it at the time, and just brushed it off, but once school fully began I had already fallen for another girl. After maybe a month of denial I finally accepted that I had feelings for her. Feelings I hadn't felt before. But these weren't sexual feelings. Maybe once or twice during the ordeal I had intrusive sexual thoughts about her, but I quickly shook them off, reacting in disgust. Sex was not something I wanted with her. I just wanted fluffy, romantic things. I never told her how I felt, however, and eventually came to the conclusion that she didn't like me on my own. Thus, as it was already nearing it's end, I just got rid of it as best I could and moved on. I still had a desire for a relationship though, and became concerned that I would never find one. I thought that due to my personality, people would think I'm asexual (which I still thought was aro at this time) and not consider me an option. Eventually, though I don't remember exactly why, I decided to do some research on asexuality. It was that night that I first had the reaction that ""this might be me.""

After a bit of research I was identifying myself as asexual, and came out to pretty much everyone I knew. This period of confidence, however, didn't last forever. I was soon stricken with self doubt, with came and went in phases. I would be fine, then not, then fine again. During these periods of self doubt I would frantically research and post here and on Reddit. It was to the point where I'd have a pre-typed summary of all my thoughts and feelings about it that I would put in every post, hoping that people would tell me who I am. I needed a label to function. The uncertainty from not having one would kill me. I would receive support time and time again, yet the cycle continued. I began worrying if it was ever going to end, if the constant doubt meant I was wrong about the whole thing, but I still tried. Soon, the phases became slightly different, calmer, if you will. It didn't feel like I was being eaten from the inside from the confusion and doubt, but I wasn't confident either. I was in limbo, not quite sure, still shifting ever so slightly back and forth.

Now, I've looked back on all that I've posted, but this still raises more confusion. In all my posts, I've gotten differing answers on where I am. Some say gray ace, some say asexual, and others say maybe not ace after all. It's confused me to no end. I didn't feel like anyone, including myself, could come up with an answer. I've gone back and forth in the past few days, but now I'm still sort of not sure. I've talked to some people that say I'm ace, and other's that say maybe not, and I don't know how I feel about myself. That initial research night was about 7 months ago, and I don't know how much longer my journey will take.

But still, maybe I was always asexual and didn't know because of our society.",Asexual
No clearly defined place?,"So , I've been making ""am I ace?"" posts for a while now, and a lot of times I get answers that differ. Some say I'm in the gray area, while others would put me in just the asexual area. I've made other posts asking specifically where I'd fit, assuming that I am on the spectrum, and I still get differing answers. Some have even told me that I could identify with whichever I feel better with, and I'm not sure which one that is. I know that aces differ quite a bit, but I still want to find out where I best fit. Does anyone else not really have a clearly defined place, in that they're not sure if they belong in the gray area or not?

As for how I feel, when  it comes to relationships, my two crushes were purely romantic, and all I desired was the emotional aspect. Sex really isn't an aspect I want in a relationship, and in my vision of a perfect relationship sex is absent. I can recall thinking why people would ruin a perfectly good relationship with sex. When it comes to other things though, I do have a libido, and masturbate, though I know that it doesn't really matter all that much. I usually only do it because I'm bored. If I ever use visuals I don't concentrate on who's doing what, but rather what's being done. If I ever fantasize, it's never about a specific person, rather an anonymous figure (if that makes sense). It's more of the act than anything else. My main source of doubt on this subject comes from this weird feeling that I get. I can get this feeling out of nowhere, where my heart rate increases and I can sometimes get this weird tingling ""down there"" (though it's definitely not anywhere close    to full arousal, if it's arousal at all). This can occur from physical proximity or looking at someone (often with people I guess I'd find aesthetically attractive, though I don't actively think of them as such). My thoughts don't really line up with it, and I'm usually just thinking about the fact that I'm feeling something. It's a little jarring, I guess. It also goes away very quickly. If it makes any difference though, I am in my mid teens and thus hormones may pay a part.

So am I just in an place where I don't even fit cleanly into the gray area, or  something? I don't know...

Ace people should be able to be sexy without being considered a “waste”,"I workout and value my physical fitness, but, like anyone, l like to look good.

EDIT for questions: Does it just come on? Like dating her before we got married, she was insatiable for a month and then just nothing. We dated for 3 years. Things were always going to turn around, sex stopped because of the anti depressants (she's been off them for over a year now), then it was because we were living with parents (been in our own place for 5 years), blamed it on not being married (going on 4 years next week of marriage), and now it's because she's asexual.

Is it something that usually happens earlier in life? What's considered early? She's now 28. Again, this is something that all of a sudden last month she's claiming she is.

Am I an ace?,"21 years into my life, I always considered myself a gay guy, something was always a miss though. I never felt attracted to any dick pics/balls/vagina etc. I just found them gross, when I masturbate I read most of time gay  but sometimes straight  erotica instead of watching porn. I think about how it feels instead of imagining the physical imitation. I don't have any interest in dating any girls or guys, or having sex with them. I rather play video games or read books in my bed. I find romance waste of time since it doesn't seems to last forever and it doesn't do anything productive to your life. I wouldn't mind having another partner but not for sex but for living together if you get it what I mean. 

Do you think I am ace? ",Asexual
Am I? That's the question.,"I never considered asexuality to be an option. No hate about it, I just always shied away from all the confusing and very very specifically detailed terms I couldn't remember.

Currently on vacation and in a drunk stint my bff told me I might be asexual. It baffled me but it feels.. oddly fitting?
I always considered myself bisexual, because I can see how someone is attractive and feel somewhat attracted to them. I had one boyfriend, a few hook ups. All male. There were a few girls I was attracted to but I never got further than kissing.

The thing is, sex really doesn't do it for me. Not really at least. I feel some pleasure during the act but I never ""lost my mind"" and I always just got it over with it. 

I got an extremely low libido and the only times I do something is to scratch an itch before that time of the month. Which I suppose is simply biology playing it's part.

Right now I'm just confused and slightly anxious about this ocean of information I will have to wade through if I'm not simply lesbian. And if I am I'm not even sure how to picture relationships anymore.

unsure on romantic orientation,"So I've always been a little socially anxious and I always assumed through middle and high school this was why I was never super interested in pursuing girls. Along with this I could recognize aesthetically attractive females but I never really felt any reason to pursue a relationship. The only time I ever tried anything was in my junior year when a girl showed some interest. I had been working on my social anxiety that year and saw it as another challenge in my goal to become more social and I guess fulfill that societal quota. I saw them as aesthetically attractive and I felt nervous around them (heartbeat, etc) but I never felt any real personal connection and the whole time I spent pursuing her it felt like I was pursuing them because I felt a societal pressure that I was supposed to go out with people or something. I guess I always assumed people only wanted to go out with others to brag or show they were manly but I’ve been told they actually want to go out with people and its not just a societal thing.

Now onto my mental struggle. While I had these feelings for a girl once. It felt very shallow and superficial. I’ve had two male friends however who I felt particularly close to. I had one friend in middle school who I felt very close to. I knew him from early elementary school through middle school and we were very close. We cuddled a few times at sleepovers and I can remember fantasizing a few times about being closer to them. I had some classmates harass me and accuse me of being gay and that led me to not think about my sexuality and brush it off.

I have a friend currently now who I really like and I feel like I’m having a repeat of my past feelings. I’ve known him for about two years and we’ve always gotten around well. We have similar interests and it feels like we’re really in sync on our attitudes opinions and sense of humor. I just really love being around him. I’ve also found that I also feel like I have some magnetism to be close physically to them and help them when we’re together. I read when I was researching dating during junior year and I remember reading that you were supposed to make physical touch to show interest and I never understood how anyone would want to do that, but I sort of understand around my current male friend. We also recently went to prom with a group and basically hung out together the entire time, so we basically went together, and I just had a really good time. He’s honestly the only person I’m willing to be open with and this is very rare for me. I would be totally happy if I found out tomorrow I had to spend the rest of my life with them.

Despite what seems like stronger feelings I lack any sort of that aesthetic attraction that I have around females. I just feel more of a desire to be around these male friends despite a lack of aesthetic attraction. It feels like I lack these romantic feelings as I’ve never truly understood the point of relationships when I would much rather have someone who is just fun to be around who I can live with and be a companion.

Asexuality and Cilantro,I was talking with my SO the other day and realized that sexuality is a lot like cilantro. Some people are born with the taste buds that make it awesome and they want it.

"""How can you know if you haven't tried?""","I'm pretty sure this is the most obnoxious response I get when I tell people what is up with me. I've known since I was a kid (now in my 40's) that I was never going to have sex, that I'm just not ""wired"" for it. On top of it, I'm sex-repulsed so even the concept of doing it just for procreation's sake is pretty cringey for me.

It's so bizarre living in a world where society doesn't understand. Where well-meaning people constantly threaten that they intend to pay some stranger to rape you all better (i.e. prostitute). Being an ace amidst a sea of heteronormatives sometimes feels like being the only non-believer on an island of Mormons. They're not bad people, but they want to do everything they can to ""save"" you, and they can't comprehend it any other way.

Anyway, determining whether I'm actually ace/gray/demi/etc. is a pretty recent development for me as I've just quietly carried this by myself all this years dodging strip club jaunts and attempted professional rape.

How do I communicate sexual needs without feeling coercive?,"My partner is ace, I am not. It's something I knew before we started this relationship, but we have such a wonderful connection that I decided the work would be worth it. And usually, I'm right. He makes me laugh a lot, he opens my eyes to new worlds, and he cares for me deeply. I love him very much and after a year and a half I know that I want him around for a long time.

However, as expected, sex isn't always easy. I want more, and I have no idea how to ask for it. My SO says that I just have to spell it out, and I know that's what I should do, but I find that so difficult. I worry that by asking him to have sex more often or trying to ask if we can have sex right now, I'm pressuring him to have sex with me whether he wants it or not. It's probably true I pout some if he rejects me, so I try really hard to not let him see his rejection hurts, even if I know it's nothing personal. The easiest way to avoid an emotion reaction is to never ask, but that's obviously not sustainable either. I don't know how to ask him for sex or support without feeling like I'm pushy at best and manipulative/coercive at worst.

So, to any asexual people or SOs of aces, what do you define as the line between disappointment and rejection? How do I get rid of the nagging feeling I'm some manipulative crazy SO? Do you have any other ideas or thoughts on the situations?

Can I be ace if I still have sex?,"So I go through phases (about 3- 6 months) of not wanting anyone to do anything sexual with me at all, nothing past a cuddle. But then sometimes I do get sexual attraction, but I am incapable of organs and to me sex is just a physical act, it's nice but nothing special. But I do enjoy seeing what it does to the person I'm with. I can tie the level of wanting sex to my mental health (on a % scale from 0-30% I'll have sex 30-70% I'm ace and I don't know past 70% ) but that's a pretty tenuous assumption.

Another Reason Not to Tell People You’re Ace,"Came out to my manager today. She’s been talking to me a lot about how I need to find a boyfriend, and I was like “actually, I’m asexual” because I was sick of her bad advice.

Big mistake! She told me I was too young to know my own sexuality. I’m 25...

I jokingly admitted that I’m not the only asexual in my family and she took this to mean that I saw my uncle’s single lifestyle and just wanted to emulate him for kicks.

Then she told me how sad she was for me that I’d never be pleasured by an experienced male lover or experience 20 orgasms, which just made me want to barf. 

She also told me that you need a sexual partner or you’ll never grow as a person.

"Sex repulsed, tried sex for the 1st time in awhile.","I wasn't always asexual, or at least the exact way I feel today. In high school I had a high libido just like everyone else. I finally lost my virginity at 18 and it was nothing like I imagined. One it hurt, bad. Like excruciating unbearable pain. Many other girls told me it was normal to have pain the first time but after a few times I knew something was off. It took years to get a doctor to diagnose me with primary Vulvar Vestibulitis and even more years of treatment before I was a candidate for surgery. I had surgery almost 4 years ago and shortly after got involved in a new relationship. The surgery worked and for the 1st time in my life sex didn't hurt...but it didn't feel good either.

I had a lot more sex with my partner than I had ever had. I was waiting for that, well I don't know what but that feeling everyone gets when they have sex. It never came, sex just didn't feel good. After a few years I just became less and less interested in sex at all, even masturbation, it was all a complete let down. I started to find this orientation called asexual and thought it fit me perfectly. I don't really experience sexual attraction and never have, more aesthetic attraction to people. I identify as asexual because I have no desire for sex personally. I told my partner who said it wasn't a big deal to him and we began having sex less and less frequently. 

I dont know what triggered me but maybe about a year ago I just started finding all sex disgusting and repulsive. It made being intimate hard because even though sex wasn't occurring all that often ""we could do other stuff"". I dont want to do other stuff, I dont like oral, anal, foreplay anything remotely sexual. I freeze when my partner tries to be intimate, I try to think of calming things and tell myself sex is normal. I've ended up crying after sex a lot and I think my partner has finally got this isn't for me.

It's been roughly a year since we have been intimate and we are having major issues in our relationship. I decided to give it a try. It hurt, again, and made me think my condition could be back. I hated it during and cried immediately after. If I was single I don't feel like this would be such an issue for me but I think trying to be in a relationship with someone who is very allosexual is incredibly difficult. I do have quite a long history of sexual abuse which I think is where the repulsion stems from. I kind of just hate myself right now. 

I've also been questioning my gender identity or that maybe I'm just gay? I still don't feel sexual attraction to females but I straight up know I don't like sex with men. I wish this wasn't so confusing and I feel like I got seriously jipped in the sex department. I don't really know why I'm posting this here just ranting I guess.",Asexual

"From a bisexual to all you asexuals- You are valid, loved, appreciated, and recognized.","Hey! Tux here, but you can call me Andrew if you wish. I've only recently been introduced to Reddit, and even more recently accepted my sexuality (I'm bi). Since then, I've been pretty active in Reddit's bisexual community- probably mostly because it's the only community or people I am out to. My wardrobed-ness (because bisexuals are fictional, we live in Narnia, not a closet) is a long story that I'm not going to get into here, but it has made me grow quite close to the people I've met here.

I've started a second page (r/birates) for bisexual memey humor, and in doing so have come to realize that you aces are having some of the same issues we are finding relating to the LGBT community.

Now, not being active at all within your community, I have no idea what you actually deal with, but knowing how hard it must be for some people to relate to your sexuality, I can imagine you deal with some sincere stigma that can often feeling very alienating.

And, if you guys wanted to swing by r/bisexuals (where I'm primarily active) and chat with us there, I think we would have some fantastic synergy. 

I'm going to post this in r/asexuality too, it seems to have more subscribers, so I don't know which one is most active.

Unfortunately either my looks or something in my personality prevented me my whole life from connecting with anyone and I'm depressed to the point of taking my life.

How to stop inadvertently leading people on?,"Whenever I interact with someone of the opposite sex, I never consider attraction or ""flirting"" to be a thing. I've been told that I inadvertently flirt with people (I've never been given specifics as to WHAT i do) But this apparently leaves people wrong-footed when they assume I'm leading them on. 

I honestly have no idea how to flirt. I never learned because flirting and dating has obviously really never been a thing for me. When I find someone I like, its ALWAYS for friendship. And I also don't know when people are flirting with me for the same reason. I just assume people are being friendly. 

Example: I went to an event over the weekend, and all weekend long I was hanging out with a guy I met there. We gelled FANTASTICALLY.  One the final day he low-key asked me out by asking why my Boyfriend wasn't there. I explained that I was asexual and didn't date, and for some reason this upset him. After saying that he kind of got up and left and didn't talk to me the rest of the time there. 

I liked this guy (as a friend) and felt like I did something wrong. 

Its suuuuper awkward for me to explain this to people. Most people don't even GET asexuality, and it's kind of tiring for me to try to put it in a way they understand. 

So like do I just start with ""I'm not looking for a date?"" I feel like that's rude?

Is my sister-in-law asexual?,"I'm hoping some of you kind people on this subreddit can shed some light on this situation. I have known my sister-in-law for almost 9 years and after having her over for the dinner tonight I had the thought is she asexual and just doesn't realise it? I asked my wife and she said that would explain a lot. 

As far back as my wife remembers her sister has never been very interested in relationships. As a young child she would leave the room if there was kissing in a movie scene. As a teenager she would run out of a room if anything related to sex came up on the tv or in conversation. She doesn't like talking about anything around sex and she has only had one relationship which lasted a few months and as far as we're aware it didn't go far beyond holding hands. 

My wife's sister has been very religious since she was a teenager, she goes to an evangelical church weekly so for a while we put her lack of interest in sex to religious prudishness. However tonight she told a story about how the pastor of her church got a bodybuilder in the congregation to get up and show his six-pack and she was very uncomfortable with it however one of her friends in the audience told her she was just very prudish.

So is it possible that my sister-in-law is asexual but doesn't realise it? She will be thirty this year and still hasn't been in any sort of long term relationship and is still very uncomfortable even talking about anything related to sex that come up in every day adult conversation.

I wonder if being religious has made her ignorant of the possibility that she may be asexual and if there are any resources out there that might help her understand her orientation?",Asexual
"No, I did not tell you you're the reason homophoia exists, I called you a hypocrite","This is sort of a vent? I guess. I'm not too proud of it, but I just had one of them internet arguments. Decided to stop replying because the person couldn't be reasoned with and they weren't exactly polite. 

It was in the comments of an ig post, apparently people are now shitting on Thomas Sanders (a cinammonroll!) cause he said he considers ace people part of the lgbt. People got really pissed over that which is insane.

Anyway, the person dismissed asexuality, bringing it down to  ""people who don't want to fuck"".  I went there... I called them a bigot and part of the problem with the LGBT community and why people dismiss and bash it; if people within the community don't take each other seriously, how do you expect others to?
They replied with

&gt;did you just accuse me of being the reason why homophobia is real? why gay and trans people get literally murdered? You're fucking delusional.

I literally said nothing of the sorts. I didn't even bring up homophobia, I said it was unreasonable and that they're behaving in the exact same way as the people who discriminate them.

Also, sorry for the lenght. Couldn't post a picture. Was I too harsh or in the wrong? It just sucks how asexuality is so dismissed, I can't talk to anyone about it.

What's the difference between being demiromantic and greyromantic?,"I generally consider myself an aromantic asexual, but I'm not 100% sure. I feel like one of these could possibly fit, but I'm not quite sure of the distinction. Could someone please explain it to me?",Asexual
Confused about this aspect of my life and trying to figure things out.,"So I'm a 27 year old man. I've lived a relatively comfortable life all the way up until a couple of years ago. When I was younger I was quite a skirt Chaser. But it never really went anywhere. And now while I still find it nice to occasionally see individuals usually young women who might be in let's say a nice-looking swimsuit or something for the most part I have felt little to no interest in pursuing relationships with individuals or even looking into any kind of I guess you could say sexual activity. For the longest time I never really knew what this meant and to a point I still don't. Does this make me an ace? I know for a fact that I'm not homosexual. I don't hold any of my male friends or roommates in any kind of romantic interest. And while everyone else likes to go on those little blind date type parties I never do.

Has anyone had gone through anything like this? Again do these strange and confusing thoughts mean that I am an ace? Or does it mean something else?",Asexual

Incels on r/asexual? (Rant),"I've noticed a growing number of incels on this subreddit trying to relate to us. I wouldn't really mind, except most of the time they're trying to talk about how they cant get sex. 

We as the asexual community are oppressed (treated unfairly, criticized, accused) because of our sexuality, and incels think they are ""oppressed"", just cause they lack the social skills to convince someone to do it with them. For a more popular example, imagine if a straight person commented on an LGBT forum discussing the social hardships of being gay, and they were like ""oh yeah I'm not gay, I'm straight, but people are super rude to me too :("" . I'm pretty sure they would just be told to gtfo. 

I'm not saying they don't have problems or hardships, but this isn't the place to have a pity party over not getting boned.

Edit: sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile

Edit 2: I guess to put it better, I mean I feel we need kind of a safe haven away from sex and allosexual discussion. I think its perfectly fine if they want to leave their sex/ romance problems and incel talk at the front door to learn about asexuals and discuss it. 

Edit 3: even though I personally dont agree with this, a few people; and one very colorful person that insisted on saying there's something wrong with me, that I'm ""cringy"" and ""weak"", have pointed out that oppressed might not be the right word. So to spite that one misguided person, I will not be removing it from the post. I will, however, add alternative words for those who handled their disagreement in a relatively kind and mature manner :) ",Asexual
Questions for sex positive/neutral aces and access with libido,"Hey all! I'm aroace and sex repulsed, but have been having trouble helping a friend understand some of the ways that aces with libido deal with it. Specifically with parsing the difference between sexual attraction and libido and more of the nuances with how to parse those. 

He knows that they are different, but is a little on the struggle bus for understanding why and I'm not sure I was really able to explain it. 

Edit: I asked him to repeat his question, and this is what he said:

I am struggling to understand Ace+Libido. Am Gay+Libido and for me they are the same/happen at the same time. 

I experience both and am having a difficult time conceptually. I logically understand that they are different. Is just difficult to see the space between them.",Asexual
My mom would rather think I'm gay,"So I came out to my mom about being ace a couple years back. Since then, she's asked me multiple times if I'm actually gay. Of course I say no, I'm asexual, but I guess she just doesn't understand how someone could NEVER WANT SEX!!!! because sex just makes the world go round!! /s. ""Well a lot of times when people are gay, they try to cover it up"". If I was gay why would I try to cover it up with a controversial, confusing sexuality??

 Not only do you have to pay a price to be loved, the reward might just be completely absent altogeher, for no reason. Nobody owes you love.

What is going on with me?,"for note: 18M

I've made a lot of posts on here so I'm sorry if it seems like I'm beating a dead horse.I’ve put together a list of reasons that support my asexuality and maybe aromantiscm and some doubt that may undermine them. What do you guys think?reasons for:

1. not particularly sex crazy (neutral on idea of fucking)
2. don't instinctively think of people as sexy (admire looks but doesn't cross mind that would have sex)
3. view masturbation as activity to do for fun. I have an on and off switch for masturbation where if I feel like doing it I might log into my reddit alt and my brain will switch into masturbation mode and then I’ll be able to be masturbate but if I go do some other shit its pretty easy for me to turn off that part of my brain.
4. view relationship as transaction of traits and purely companionship. I have a few key friends who I get along so well with and am so in sync with I don’t think I’d mind spending the rest of my life with them. Like I can fantasize about being close to them and this doesn’t bother me in the slightest and after school got out I was really missing this same friend and I’ve been looking for excuses to hang out a lot. I had a similar situation in middle school where me and a friend were very close. At sleepover we would cuddle during a movie and in school a lot of people made fun of me claiming I was gay. I ultimately buried any worry about sexuality as I didn’t want to deal with figuring out if I was gay.
5. I see females as cute but never really interested in relationship and I’ve always been confused between if this just general acknowledgment of beauty means that I want to date them or if it’s strictly admiration. I can try to imagine sexual thoughts about females around me but I just feel grossed out about myself. This has been a major hang up for me.
6. have always thought relationships in high school were a status symbol and no one seriously felt strong feelings for others
7. have had the feelings surrounding another person once when they showed interest and even then I viewed the time I spent pursuing it a social venture (almost like a social challenge) and mostly admired the looks department
8. I guess I would have sex but it's always been on the backburner for me and I can't understand all the relationship posts I see where male SOs get angry when they're girlfriends won't sex with them on a weekly basis at least. I imagine that if I were the male in that situation I would just masturbate on my own. That's safer and I don't have to deal with another person. Plus aren't you supposed to date someone for their personality and what you have in common.  While a relationship doesn’t really appeal to me all that much if I was in one I’d have no problem in a sex free one.
9. I’ve always hated how unsubtle modern pop music is about sex. I’ll always remember rides on the cold bus to middle school by early 2010s pop hits as it always made me feel a little uncomfortable. I’ve always loved classic rock, alt rock, singer songwriter and grunge because its much less explicit and almost more pure about its topics
10. always been straight by defaultReasons that I’m maybe not:
11. about 1.5 years ago I pursued a girl who I thought was pretty, only because she seemed to show some interest and I sort of saw it as the next social thing I should be working on as I had been trying to improve my social skills that year and I saw it as a thing on my list. It seems like I had all the usual signs of a crush (increased heartbeat due to nervousness). Ultimately, we went out on a date but she wasn’t interested, but looking back I can’t really see why I spent time pursuing her as I didn’t have a lot in common with her and it feels like I just did so because she showed some interest and I only admired her looks. In that whole time no sexual thoughts really came into my head and I remember she said that she decided that she wasn’t going to have sex until marriage and this didn’t bother me in the slightest. Looking back today I’m glad it didn’t work but I’m grateful for the experience. I’m not sure if this should enforce or weaken my theory that I’m asexual and possibly aromantic you tell me.
12. maybe I’m just inexperienced
13. I don’t understand how normal people feel so I don’t know if I’m different. I always thought that people saying that they would fuck someone in their irl life was a joke that people used to look manly but it sounds like that people are serious. At the same time what if all this talk of sex is actually just people trying to appear manly. I can’t find reality in this aspect of the world. My friend told me how romantic it was that his girlfriend stole his sweatshirts and I can’t see it. I value my shit why would I want someone who will ultimately break up with me taking my stuff where I’ll have to get It later.
14. when I was in middle school I had girls tease me everyday to the point where at one point three cornered me in the hallway and made thrusting motions toward me.  I don’t feel like this has affected me today but could it all be subconscious?Judging from this rambly list maybe its blatantly clear that I’m an asexual but I just don’t know. For so many years I just assumed I was socially awkward but I’m a more confident person now and I just don’t feel that drive to go out and fuck and date that I’m supposed to have at 18.  I just want an answer and I fear that if I just go back to the straight by default label the possibility of asexuality will haunt me forever and that if I go with asexual and discover that I was wrong in four years I’ll have lost four years to a false identity. Any guidance is appreciated",Asexual
Were my crushes just a phase?,"So , I've been questioning whether or not I'm asexual for quite a while, and I've just decided to put that on the backburner as to not get obsessed with it (again). So I'm trying to focus on other things, and one of those is a possible relationship. I'm only 15, so I'm still young and I've got a lot of time, but I'm kind of worried that I'll never find anyone. I think that I've had two crushes , within a month of each other, and they were just last year. Before that I didn't really want a relationship for a long time. After the second crush ended in mid December, I haven't felt anything remotely similar to it, and sometimes I'm scared that I'll never feel that way again. I've thought that I did feel something afterwards, but it all turned out to be me just hoping it was. 

I've never felt like anything but just heteroromantic, though I've wished I was aro before. I feel like I want something that I can't have, like I have a desire for romance, but nothing actually there. Is it possible my crushes were just a phase? Should I just wait for these feelings to come back? Is there something wrong with me, or am I just making a huge leap?",Asexual

Social interactions as an Ace,"Not sure yet if I'm Ace or Graysexual, but I want to talk about something that bothers me. Maybe someone can relate.

As a man, I feel that every interaction I have with a girl is on some level, either on the surface or underneath, the other person trying to figure out if I am trying to have sex with them. And sometimes I will have the questions asked straight out, or when I ask for someones contact details they will say ""I have a boyfriend"", revealing what is on their mind. And this is nothing strange of course, because most other men ARE hitting on them. But what also happens frequently is disbelief. They think I am lying to them to finally get into their pants later. That me saying ""I don't want anything from you"" is a lie. It's just so upsetting, how many friendships could have been if both sides put aside their ego for a moment and listened. Really listened.

A crush??,"So I've known I'm asexual for maybe 6 years now. There's this guy that works at my local drug store that just started working there, and I get super nervous around him. I don't want to kiss him or anything, I just think he's cute and want him to like me too. This is so weird for me. What is this? What do I do?",Asexual
How triggered are you by sex AND amorousness?,"I'm basically middle aged but because of trauma and abuse I'm seriously unable to watch anything with sex or lovey dovey stuff. So people making out, whether IRL or on TV or movies, I just can't. It's especially true when it's kids/teens. I have to opt out of a lot of things to preserve my sanity.

There's that scene in Taxi Driver when he kicks over the TV bc of that. And when he makes finger guns at the movie theater at the people on screen. 

Ironically I can watch porn but that feels different and fake and I can put rings of division between what I feel when I see it on TV. That's because masturbation is more of a routine for me like brushing my teeth or shaving and porn helps me get there but I don't put any thought into it. 

But I feel like...not even like less of a person....I don't feel like a person at all. I don't feel like a human. I'm such an alien to ""normal"" human behavior and mating and boding rituals and don't know how to share, obtain, keep, or dismiss them. I'm just rattling in a cage. 

And I can't talk about sex or relationships with anyone. Not friends or family. My closet friends understand this and respect it.

And yes I'm fine. I'm just being real. But I'm not going to hurt myself bor anything.",Asexual

Little rant sorta?,"So, I'm asexual and my bf isn't. And it's totally ok bc he does accept me. But I'm weird with some shit. I like and also do not like kissing. I never and never will make out with him he knows this. So cross that off the list. The thing is, kissing makes me uncomfortable except sometimes I do like it? (Not in a  sexual way, kind of a cute way). I am also...terrible at it lol..

I also am annoyed however. People tell me I can't be asexual if I've never tried anything. I've never masturbated before, never had nor wanted to have sex, and so on. I know I'm ace. These things disgust me. Usually just the idea of me doing it.

It's not my problem if someone else does it but it's still gross to me and makes me have a somewhat bad opinion of them. Nothing I can do to stop myself from doing that. 

Just kinda wish my bf was ace sometimes. Or I had someone who was ace in my life or more people at least. I feel so alone and angry.

(Try nihilistic masturbations... Without imagery... It works perfectly too sometimes)

Feeling guilty that I'm not fulfilling girlfriends needs,"So, background, I'm polyamorous as well as(obviously) are the three women I'm romantically involved with. I get all the cuddles, hugs, kissing and romance that I could want, and it's great...for \*me\*. But one of my girlfriends is very hypersexual, and her only steady partners are myself and another Ace girl.  


I'm aware that, especially in the kink and polyamorous communities, you can't get all of your needs fulfilled from one person. But she's got several people and not getting one priority need taken care of at \*all\*. And I can't help but think back to my relationships from before where my needs were ignored, and how it felt. I love this woman, she's very important to me, And I don't like thinking how her needs are being ignored like this.  


A couple days ago I offered that I could try and fill that niche for her, that the only compulsion I have for massaging her is because I'm happy she's happy, and it'd kinda be the same thing, but she turned me down, said "" We have an attraction connection, and it's good for me."" But I know the lack is hitting her, making her feel sexually undesirable, and I hate that. I want her happy.

A little confused,"Hey! So, I've already answered a few people on Reddit about asexuality and stuff and I'm certain about being asexual, but there's just one thing that keeps getting me confused and I guess I should finally try to speak it out.

So, I call myself a panromantic ace, but I'm not sure about being panromantic. I mean, I like people. I always think I could love them regardless of their gender or whatever. But I haven't fallen in love for a few years now (3-4) and I wonder whether I'm really panromantic or aromantic.

I'd love to have a special someone and this kind of stuff but at the same time... I don't know. It feels like I can't feel this kind of thing for someone. Every time I think someone looks interesting I also have thoughts like ""but this one is probably alosexual. He/she won't understand me, it wouldn't work"" etc. And it makes me give up on the idea of talking to that person. Even now there's a guy in my class which I find very interesting and would love to talk to but I can't imagine myself with him as being my boyfriend. I wouldn't like to kiss him and stuff, for example. I'd be glad with just being caring with each other and I'm confused whether it is because I can be aromantic or just because that's how some aces are, you know?

Before discovering myself as an ace I had a boyfriend who I've dated for 5 years. (coincidence enough he also came out as an ace a few years after we broke up) and I thought I loved him and stuff, but looking back at it now I'm very confused if I was really in love with him or just captivated by the IDEA of loving someone. It may sound confusing, sorry haha. But I myself am really confused about it. I like people, as I said before. But am I able to love them romantically? I don't know.

Am I biatheistic?,"I am heteroromantic and male.

I know that I am attracted to females but I find a lot of males attractive. I sometimes wish I was biromantic so I could have a crush on these men.

When I see heteroromantic couples I sometimes think that the men are too good for their girlfriends.

I also find a lot of men cute/adorable/extremely attractive. 

I have types of men I find attractive. I also quite like feminine men and ""teddy bears"".

Today I saw a man who I spoke to for the first time in about 6 weeks. I didn't see his face properly when I met him the first time. When I saw his face I found it extremely attractive. If I was biromantic I would 100% have a huge crush on him... I wanted to get his phone number as he's also learning Japanese but I also found him very attractive so I didn't.

"(17 M) I'm not sure what I am, really.","Hello reddit world,

I'm not even sure if this is the right place to share what I'm about to share. And some of the stuff in this post is EXTREMELY personal but I feel the need to tell someone, even anonymously. I've never said some of this stuff to anyone. Thanks in advance to whoever takes time out of your day to respond to (yet another) confused teenager. I actually thought I was asexual when I was 14 because I never felt attracted to girls, but then I started to realize that I'm somewhat attracted to boys. So 2 years ago at 15 I came out as gay to my family and several of my friends. They were all great about it, btw. Now I'm afraid I'll have to ""re-come out"" as asexual. 

The reason I feel I may be asexual is because my sexual desire is small. And (if you look in my post history you'll see this too) I've never masturbated (fully) and when I try to it feels more like I'm on a ""mission"" as opposed to being excited to do it. It doesn't feel pleasurable, although that could be partly because I'm circumcised and that takes away some sensitivity. 

Idk if it's: a.) a hormonal imbalance (possibly very low testosterone) b.) a chromosomal disability (XXY chromosome?), c.) if I'm asexual, or d.) if I'm gay but simply reluctant to try masturbation or have sex one day. 

A: part of the reason why I feel it might be a hormonal imbalance is because I am certainly attracted to attractive guys my age and whatnot, so maybe my testosterone is low and I don't feel the same powerful ""tug"" towards sex and masturbation as most teenage guys are. 

B: part of the reason why I feel it might be a chromosomal disability (XXY chromosome) is because I have some (but not all) of the symptoms of an XXY chromosome, including a small penis, larger than average nipples (I don't have anything close to full breasts but they are larger than most of my peers'), low sex drive. But I don't have some of the other symptoms, like trouble learning. I'm a top student. My success in academic activities is like the only thing I have going for me. 

C: part of the reason why I feel like I might be asexual is pretty straightforward: I don't feel compelled to masturbate or have sex, although I could imagine having sex in the future if I have a bf, maybe. I definitely experience some limited sexual excitement because I get hard at sexually stimulating activities (you know what I mean).

D: part of the reason why I think I'm gay (which is what I currently identify as) is because that's what I originally thought, and, as I've already said, I feel some sexual excitement. 

What should I do to navigate all of this? I don't feel comfortable saying to anyone, even (and especially) my parents, about some of the things I've said, such as masturbation and attraction. Maybe, maybe I could come to terms with talking to my grandparents or an uncle who I'm close to. And if I have a chromosomal or hormonal problem then how would I go about getting a kareotype and/or a hormonal check? This is so confusing... thanks again to all who respond. ",Asexual

I feel like I am the only person who isn't dependent on someone to put their dick inside me to be happy. I still like holding hands and kissing etc... it's just not a neccessity. ",Asexual
I swirling cesspool of negativity and dark emotions.,"Title should have been ""A swirling""....

I've had a very abusive and repressed upbringing which slowly transformed me from heterosexual to asexual. I wasn't born ace, I became. This makes me feel like a fraud.

To make matters worse, I'm in my 30s and never had a relationship. Some of that is by choice, some is by poor compatability. Some  by circumstances. Some by sabotage by others to make it not happen. But it's been long enough that the desire has been starved out of me. BUT...every so often, I get these pangs of hope, these feelings of ""Maybe this time will work?""

Because I'm demiromantic, every time I get close to someone and become good friends, I have a feeling that maybe I can make it happen. And I fucking hate that. I don't want these feelings.

I no longer feel butterflies. Having sexual or romantic feelings, because of my past, is majorly triggering for me and instead feel like rabid, angry bats eating my stomach. I just want to take a cheese knife and cut out the part of my brain that desires any of this. I'm envious of people who don't have any drive at all. AND I'm envious of people who do and can maintain heteronormal relationship of\-\-\-whatever it is people do. I'm not privy to that world. 

Please tell me I'm not alone in these feelings.",Asexual

What is this feeling? And what does it mean for me?,"Okay, so I'm still in my questioning phase, and I think that this one feeling that I have has been holding me back a lot, and I want to fully address it now. Sometimes when I see someone I kinda get a small feeling in my groin area, but it's not full on arousal I think (I don't even get an erection). More of a tingle that's very short in duration. This also has maybe a quickened heart rate, but I think those are the only signs that I can see. It just sort of shows up and is just sort of there, and it really confuses me. I don't really have any accompanying ""urges"" or whatever (though me and recognizing my own feelings don't mix all that well). It also happens less frequently in real life, and possibly the more that I know someone. I have a slight feeling that this may be a hormonal thing (I'm only 15).  I got this feeling a lot a couple of nights ago and right then I doubted my (presumed) asexuality more than ever. What is this? Is this a sign that I am not asexual after all?",Asexual

Am I feeling sexual attraction if I consciously have to try and imagine it and don't like it? and other questions,"Ok so I've been questioning my sexuality recently as I've been burying a lot of my concerns since middle school so I've been faced with a lot of info recently.  My only hangup on asexuality is what I'm supposed to be feeling with sexual attraction.  I tend to recognize people's faces as attractive, aesthetic attraction I guess, but I don't have any desire to pursue a relationship or date.  in the past and presently I can I guess try to simulate sexual attraction if that makes any sense?  Like I have to consciously try and make myself think about the idea of having sex with someone and I don't get anything out of it and generally just feel disgusted at myself for thinking about it.  I feel like this screams asexuality but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure.  
I also was questioning the one time I actively acted on an aesthetic attraction and even went on one date.  This was over the span of a few weeks and I can't remember one time that I considered the person I was talking with sexually.  It  seems like this is a huge priority for most guys I know in relationships and it confuses me.  I had a friend brag about all the tail he gets and how it would be super hard to be celibate but I fail to understand this.  I would have no issue not having sex ever.  
My last concern with asexuality relates to romantic attraction.  While I find females more aesthetically pretty I guess I don't really desire physical contact with them.  At the same time I don't generally find guys cute except in illustrations but I desire closer intimate contact with male friends (cudding, closeness in general) and when I imagine a relationship with a guy I'm fairly neutral on it and it doesn't really bother me.  I should note I have a similar attitude to a relationship with women.  This was a big hangup for me in middle school when I suspect I had a crush on one of my male friends but I buried the idea after middle school.  I don't feel gay as I don't find males irl to be that attractive but I can be aroused by pictures of male genitalia.  I feel like my standards for a relationship all hinge on functional traits like money management and similar interests and I find that guys fit those standards far more than women do.  
I'm super confused overall and if anyone can help or needs further info feel free to PM me or comment below.  ",Asexual
Can someone shine some light into my life?,"I’m what I believe to be a heterosexual male. My whole life I’ve been sexually aroused and attracted to females but never really was outgoing enough or attractive enough to land a relationship. I had my first sexual encounter at 17 where I made out with a girl and she gave me head. It was rather passionate and I enjoyed both parts, but when she initiated sex I just couldn’t come through. She said I was gay which left me perplexed. On one hand I found her attractive and enjoyed what we had done but on the other I felt no drive to have sex and I guess I came to the realization that I find the vagina itself to just not be sexually stimulating. Years later and I haven’t pursued many woman as I don’t want to repeat this embarrassing experience, as much as I would like to enjoy the company of another person. Does anyone have any insight on my situation? Am I just asexual to a degree?

Just hosted a casual high school party. Don’t know what I expected.,"As mentioned, I’m in high school. I hosted a sort of “party” today with a group of friends. Beyond games like cards against humanity, Wiii U, etc, we also played games like Paranoia, Truth or Truth, and “lifesaver?” I think, a game where people have forty five seconds to ask the person in the middle questions. 

My friends are fellow teenagers. How do you guys think THAT went?

“What’s your deepest sexual fantasy?”

“Who here would you sleep with?”

“Celeb crush?”

Etc, etc. I found out people who had crushes on me for a time simply by one action or something (like a 12 hour crush from me reading at homecoming)

It almost creeps me out to think of others thinking about things like this. I tend to default to thinking everyone is ace. I know that’s not true, but while I may have previously liked people in the group, the idea of them liking me sexually just makes any romantic attraction drop off a cliff. 

I can’t relate, even though I know I probably should?  I don’t know. Anybody else have these situations?

Pride month is making me feel awful,"Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely amazing that the community has this whole month to just celebrate despite all that they've gone through.

I just feel empty now, I feel alone, even though I know so many amazing people in the community. I feel like I don't belong in the community (I'm a Panromantic Asexual). I feel like I can't be in a relationship without sex, and that I'm lying to myself, even though I know that I had a crush on someone who was the same gender as me. I feel like I'm invalidated in my identity, and I hate myself for it.

I came out as Asexual, but I realised later that I'm Panromantic. After a year of being out I had to start over and come out all over again, and I hate everything about it. People think that I'm lying, that I was just hiding behind Asexuality or that I'm faking it to fit in, but I had a crush on a girl that was so strong I couldn't even talk around her, and the idea of having sex with her or anyone disgusts me, but what I felt there was real.

This month I'm going to Pride. I feel awful about it. I feel like I'm forcing my way into a community, even though my friends want me there. I feel invalidated in everything I'm doing and feeling and saying, and this month is supposed to be the month that I should feel proud if who I am, but I don't feel proud at all.

Edit: thank you for all the nice comments, I think that I just needed to hear that I wasn't alone in feeling uncertain or bad about things. I'm feeling a little better about attending Pride, but I still feel bad. Even though I can accept other people for who they are I'm still trying to learn how to accept myself, but I'm working on it. I think once I'm at Pride I'll really start to feel good about myself. 💕",Asexual
What are some questions that I can ask myself?,"(Just FYI, I have posted a similar thing on AVEN already, but I want to get a variety of answers on this)

So, I've finally gotten out of my crazy obsessive self doubt phase and am now a little bit more comfortable with who I am, however, I still don't think I'm really all that much closer with finding myself. All I've done is become comfortable with questioning, and I don't want my questioning to last forever. I think that the key to being able to find myself is to really answer some questions honestly, and a lot of them. I'm not the best with asking myself questions, as I'm not too confident in my assertions and I tend to second guess myself and can't really tell what I'm feeling. I want to become better at finding clear answers for myself, so then I can tackle harder questions for me, like, ""do you desire partnered sex?"" or ""do you feel sexual attraction?"" Both of those are, ""I don't know."" for me, because I don't think I trust myself to come up with an answer, so I never get one.

Help me decide which asexual characters to draw for Pride Month!,"For this year's pride month, I decided to challenge myself to draw as many asexual characters as possible by the end of the month.  I've done this before with challenges like Inktober so I'm reasonably certain I can get at the very least 10 quick drawings out by the end of the month, although  I can probably do more \(not committing to anything though, I'm job\-hunting and pretty busy\).

Unfortunately, it is hard to find characters that are \(likely\) ace. As such I'm turning to Reddit for suggestions of characters I should draw. There are 4 rules for which characters I draw. These are: 

1. the character must be ace either by saying they are in canon \(or basically saying the equivalent, IE ""I've never been attracted to anyone""\), having their creator say they are ace via [Word of God](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod) or have STRONG fandom backing for them being ace.
2. the character must be fictional. I played around with the idea of doing pictures of [Tim Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Gunn#Personal_life) or [Nikola Tesla](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Asexual_people), but I'm weirdly uncomfortable with drawing pride pictures for real people? however, if enough people want me to, I will reconsider.
3. They must be either a positive or neutral example of asexuality. that means no asexual, unfeeling asshole characters that have no emotions, no characters whose asexuality is a joke \(Sheldon Cooper\) or they are ""just confused"" \(Olivia, The Olivia Experiment\)  No villains either! neutral or lovable bad guys are fine, but just, no assholes, please
4. I'm not doing any deities either, that a can of worms I don't want to open. I would be willing to draw asexual mythical creatures though, as long as they are not gods/goddesses

I do already have a short list of characters that I'm definitely drawing.  these are:

1. Jughead Jones \(yes, I'm ignoring the ""Riverdale"" universe. although, bonus points to Cole spouse, the actor who plays Jughead, for wanting him to be ace. to bad he was overridden by the studio.\)
2. Todd, from BoJack Horseman \(What, I cant ignore the ONE guy on tv that got respectful treatment and is actually a CANON ace character\)
3. Charlie Weasley \(can forget dragon boy. BTW, does anyone have any good headcanons about his physical appearance? I don't seem to remember him described much in the books\)
4. Monkey D Luffy, who was declared asexual via Word of God \(and is fun as heck to draw\)

I also have a few characters I'm thinking about drawing but haven't added to the ""definitely"" list yet. these are \(along with the reasons I'm not sure about drawing them.

1. Luna Lovegood \(later married and had kids\)
2. Roronoa Zoro, from One Piece \(doesn't seem to be interested in anyone, guy or girl, but I just get a very ""gay"" vibe from him. idk\)
3. Enjolras and Jean Valjean from Les Misérables \(\(the following text is taken entirely for the TV Tropes ""Asexuality"" page\) *""Enjolras is specifically stated to have no interest in women, and his mistress is his country. While it's possible he could be a Badass Gay, it's stated after Mabeuf's death that Enjolras had never so much as kissed anyone before, so he's a Celibate Hero regardless of his orientation. The protagonist Jean Valjean also conspicuously has no romantic pairings, though he does have some significant interactions with women, most notably Fantine and her daughter Cosette. He has no desire to find a partner of his own either, as he believes himself thoroughly fulfilled in life so long as his adopted daughter loves him. Even in the backstory, the family he provided for was that of his sister and not his own.""\)*

4. Sherlock Holmes \(some renditions of him, like in Elementary, show him as allo, while others depict him as ace. if I do draw him, it will probably be a two\-part drawing of both Bumblesnooch Cutlepoot's version and Basil Rathbone's version, as both strike me as ace and I love them both. Hell, I might just through in The Great Mouse Detective Sherlock while I'm at it

Well, that's about it, I'm all out of ideas. please excuse any rambling or grammar mistakes, as I'm writing this at 5:30 am and I've been up for over twenty\-four hours. \( I make great life choices\)

For anyone who wants to suggest a character, please do so! I noticed as I was typing how guy\-centric this list was, and we definitely need to thin that out a bit. if you are looking for a character to suggest, I suggest heading [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality) first!  thank you all for your time!

Supporting my Asexual partner,"I'm a sexual female in a 1 year and a month or so relationship with my asexual male partner. I knew he was Ace before we got together. I've never had any issue with it. We have had sex and frequently too. The thing is my partner does it for me because he doesn't want me to miss out on something I clearly need, want, and enjoy. Recently it has lessened drastically and has become more of a rarity. 2-3 times a month. 

My partner insists that it isn't fair on me if he doesn't ""pull his weight"" essentially and give me what I need and like. I insist that it's okay and that I when we do have sex I feel awful because it isn't what he is comfortable doing. He views sex as an essential ""building block"" in a successful relationship as a highest level of intimacy and bonding. While this may be true (for at least some couples) it doesn't necessarily have to be. Other ways to be intimate can be found with no physical intimacy at all if desired. He is okay with kissing and cuddling and holding hands. He isn't always alright with kissing depending on how strong his asexuality is that day though. 

I've almost completely worked out how to tell whether or not he is feeling intensely ace and so can usually avoid messing up. Very ocassionally though I miss the little sign and will make a little move like neck kisses only to leave him feeling repulsed and backing says immediately. It makes me feel shitty because I misjudged the man I am supposed to know best. It makes him feel shitty because he feels I'm being left in the dark of my ""normal life"" essentially and that he feels broken. 

I've offered to have a relationship with abstinence from now on. The last time we had sex was a week ago today. He doesn't want this though. He wants me to be happy but I don't want that at the expense of his comfort and happiness. You guys got any ideas? How can I show him it's okay and I'm willing to try and help in any way I can. That if abstinence is the way then is I'll give it my all. I can't get though. How can I show him that his asexuality is not a burden and I love him the way he is?",Asexual
What's going on with me?, So I'm pretty sure I'm asexual but I've been struggling with my romantic  orientation.  Since middle school I've had no issue with physical  contact with my other male friends and I enjoyed and craved being  physically close with some males I've known.  This has definitely  carried over to today and I still have these feelings for some friend  today.  It's hard to describe it just seems like an implicit urge to  want to cuddle with specific male friends.  What's weird is that I don't  have these same desires for women even though I can definitely admire  them aesthetically more.  I've struggled with this for years and mostly  ignored it as I didn't want to deal with the idea that I was gay.  I'm  mostly confused as I have these feelings for males but it's usually only  for friends who I feel comfortable with and it's just an urge to be  closer physically but definitely nothing sexual.  This also just  confuses me as I can admire females aesthetically and it feel like my  brain is drawn to them implicitly but I really have no desire to act on  them even to the extent of merely hanging out.

My W is NSFW [but this post won't be!]. How badly am I abusing the asexual label?,"I heard about asexuality around ten years ago, and it changed my life for the better. I'm a bit of a fence-straddler and I'm personally fond of subcategories that begin in demi, gray, lith, and auto.

I write stories that contain erotica and romance, and I'm working on something larger with more character depth. I'm including in this oversexed fantasy universe a character who is arguably asexual, at least by one common definition, but also relatively promiscuous. He does struggle to find a relationship he fits in, but gets along well enough by sexual reciprocity.

So if I don't hang any lanterns on his lack of sexual attraction, it will tumble through the cracks of the narrative. I could be alright with that, but it seems like a waste of depth and a decent twist, and a loss of diversity in the setting [not to mention my personal identification: he's easy to write!]. Also there's the whole visibility and informative bit, but I'd hate to write a book that was hated by a group it was intended to support.

It seems like I'm asking for permission to be asexual all over again, but I want opinions. *Can* it be done right? I don't intend to present anything as one-sided or exclusive--contrast him with his boyfriend and major love interest: borderline sex-repulsed and very hedonophobic, but sexual. In those regards they're complete opposites with ironic compatibility. Is it plausible?

Societal Slights Against Asexuality,"I have to be honest that a few months or so back when I first read the article about how folks were upset that the Equinox video put ‘ally’ in place of ‘asexual’, while of course it wasn’t fair, the reaction to it was somewhat over the top. You’ll have to excuse younger me though, because the Equinox video was just the first event that I encountered on my way up the mountain that is exclusion and slights against this community.


Being in the asexual community has given me a new perspective on the meaning of stuff like ‘microagressions’ (or ‘slights’, as I will) and the such. The Equinox video was small, the text-book definitions of a successful relationship are small, the idea of consummating a marriage is small, every little random aphobic comment is small, just about everything against the ace community is small, and that’s why they’re the worst.


Getting blatantly discriminated against is awful, and god forbid I ever downplay that, but slights have a different kind of sharp edge to them which, although they appear smaller, make them just as bad. At least in my opinion. Slights take on a subliminal nature which becomes detrimental to questioning folks who feel dread at the idea of being asexual, because “There can’t be love without sex! You’ll be unfair to your partner!” Or even, “Did something happen to me in the past to make me feel this way? Am I traumatized? Am I broken?” Of course not only is the idea that there can’t be love without sex a knock to self-confidence in the dating scene, but if the idea that a sexless marriage is doomed is instilled in  person, waiting for that shoe to drop might be exactly what ends an otherwise fine relationship.
And what about a relationship where an asexual person fakes it? Is an insincere emotion towards a partner more fair than one where you’re truthful to yourself and on the same page as your SO? A surprising amount of people seem to think so, but personally that doesn’t sound fair for either person in that relationship.


So please forgive me and others for finding offence that some random Ph.D from 10 years ago felt that sex was a vital part of a successful marriage, and that their opinion was published in a textbook, or that the LGBT community decided including allies was more important than asexuals. But no, I can’t not be a little angry over it, because it’s not an isolated event, it’s one more thing on the vast and ever-growing list of events I’ve already been subjected to.

Should I just give up?,"So, I know that I posted here just recently, but I'm kinda freaking out and I need to get this out. Ever since I started doubting myself and learned more about asexuality last December, I've had to deal with self doubt. I think that I've only fully accepted myself for a total of maybe a month, possibly shorter. Now, I'm dealing with it again, and I feel that it may be coming back a lot stronger this time. I'm beginning to think that it's never going to stop. This has led to me thinking if I should just give trying to fight it and go back to being straight again. I'm not sure if I even really feel straight, or ace, or anything. I don't know how I feel or who I am. My feelings seem to flip flop and half the time I don't even know what I'm feeling at all. \(As for context as to how I think I feel, I posted about it earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/8khp7o/always_overthinking_and_never_really_confident_in/)\).

I always overanalyze everything that I think and feel because I don't know what to make of them, and this all leads to a foul soup of mixed emotions and doubt. I don't even know if I should keep asking for advice, because no matter how helpful it is, I always seem to just go straight back. 

I wish I could just live without a label, but I just can't. A label provides a certain security and comfort that I need, and the uncertainty from life without one is just something that I can't bear.

How to overcome the 100% sure mindset?,"So, I started questioning myself last December, yet a lot of that questioning and doubt persists but I honestly don't know why anymore. When I first learned about the true definition of asexuality \(at first I thought it basically meant aromantic\) my gut reaction was that this could be me. I always thought that I couldn't be anything other than straight because I knew that if I was ever in a relationship, it would be with a girl, and I experienced aesthetic attraction \(which I thought was sexual\), where I'd have an urge to just look at people based on how the looked, and sometimes I got a small tingle that was sort of like a dulled down arousal \(though I think this is a hormonal thing, considering I'm only 15, and mentioning the word ""sex"" can get the same, if not a stronger reaction, whether I want it or not\). I masturbate as well, but now I know that these things don't exclude me from being asexual. Other signs pointed me in the direction of being ace \(in fact, I recently posted here where I gave a description of all the reasons why I think I might be, in addition to a bit of a rant\), but I digress.

However, I'm never very confident in my own assertions, so I turn to other for help most of the time. I know that you must be the one to identify yourself, but I still felt like I needed others. Thus, I made a ton of posts, both on Reddit and AVEN, pretty much talking about how I felt and asking for help and if people thought I was ace. People that responded did give really helpful stuff, and the majority said that I could very well be asexual. But still, this wasn't enough to satisfy me, because I wasn't quite 100&amp;#37; sure, and I didn't know if this would be the case forever. This is my mindset when it comes to these sorts of things, and I know it's bad, but I just feel that if I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure, I'll always just have so much doubt, and I don't want to accept things if there is a possibility of it changing. I view it as me being wrong.

I know that I'm never going to get anywhere with this, so I know that I need to change this ""must be completely sure mindset"". I know that sexuality can be fluid, and the I need to accept that things might change and I might never be absolutely and completely cure about this, just as I am with other things. What should I do and keep in mind to help me get a new mindset and get closer to accepting myself?",Asexual
Asexuality and consent,"I apologize in advance if this is jumbled, but I'm trying to work through a few things. Throughout my life I have kept coming out as asexual only to once again retreat back into the closet because it's easier to avoid that conversation with partners than talk about it. After talking to lots of people, I know that I experience attraction very differently from others, because it usually forms after I like them as a person \(I'm probably between asexual and demisexual then\). I have a decent libido and sometimes enjoy sex, though I know it's because it simply feels good and I like making my partner happy. I look back on those people and relationships and think about how for a moment I thought I was ""cured"" but it's just because the sex felt good but I was never actually attracted to the person. I never know where to put my hands because there is no where I want to touch them and mostly just enjoy kissing the person.

In the past, I have been in a sexually abusive relationship and other couplings in which my ""no's"" were protested until I finally said yes. Sometimes I had protested and eventually gave in and even enjoyed the encounter. Sometimes the encounter would end and I'd think ""what happened? why did we have sex?"" and I would feel gross or empty. I'm worried that my asexuality invalidates consent because technically I never really want to have sex, I just have sex because the other person wants to. I'm having trouble navigating this and I don't want to keep looking back at my relationships and remembering the couple times that I had not wanted sex but was somehow convinced to do it anyways. I feel like I always get to the point of ""I should just get it over with"" that way I can satisfy them. I am really good about saying no, I'm just not really good about standing my ground on it. What counts as non consensual and what is regretful?

tl;dr: If you are asexual and thus never really want to have sex, how can you tell the difference between consensual and non consensual sexual encounters?",Asexual
My Last Relationship Broke My Romantic Spirit,"Some backstory:
I am a transman, and over the course of my life, I've identified as ""most"" things on the LGBT+ spectrum. Even as a child, I had a high libido, and was attracted to girls and boys. I also have Asperger's, which makes it hard to feel confident about your place in the world. As such, I've always been vulnerable to suggestion, and once I started dating, felt like sex just came along with the package (being a highly sexual person, I was getting something out of the act also, so I would perform even if it made me uncomfortable).


I still needed a romantic attraction to engage in sex, but I experienced attraction fairly easily, so finding someone to date wasn't hard. And while I would enjoy the act of sex, there were always a lot of other feelings that went along with it, and sometimes I participated even though I was absolutely disgusted in the idea at the moment. I've been sexually abused here and there, and I guess that sort of thing can tend to make you weaker in these situations and take away your sense of autonomy.


I dated for quite a few years after high school. Sometimes I was in a relationship, sometimes I would just see various people during a time period. It got to a point where I would pretty much bounce from one relationship to the next, trying not to be alone with my thoughts at the end of the day. At one point, I tried a birth control, took it for a month, and it permanently ruined my ridiculously high libido. My relationships after this point were always a struggle because of it.


While most of my relationships lasted 1-2 years (even my flings would span a long time period like this), my most recent one lasted less than 6 months.


The Relationship:
He hit me up when I came out as transgender, and had intent to pursue hormones. We hung out at first, then he asked for sex. At first, I said no, to give myself time to think about it. But that didn't take long, and I gave in. He wanted to be poly amorous, but that's something I absolutely can't consent to, so eventually we agreed to be monogamous.


Over the next few short months, I came to learn that I was only a fetish in this relationship. He had a big thing for transwomen, and I guess he thought a transman would be just as much of a kink. He would totally brush me off for sex, but then when he would get transwoman porn sent to his phone, he would instantly want sex. This obviously made me feel disgusting and unwanted, so when he wanted me to Dom him with a toy during sex, I usually couldn't bring myself to comply, which made me even less desirable to him.


Things degraded quickly, and I could tell things were coming to an end. I'm pretty sure he was cheating, because he would have the worst excuses to abandon me in the middle of our plans. One of the last days, he agreed to go with me to pick up my new puppy, slept in and tried to break the plans (which almost made me miss out on the best dog ever, someone else was interested and ready to go get him), and then as soon as we got back to my house, he skipped out so he could ""give his cat flea meds"". He refused to even go up the street with me to Petsmart to pick things out for my pup (mind you, we had made solid plans to spend the day together doing these things).


When My Romantic Spirit Broke:
I was treated like such garbage and made to feel so worthless. So when he came over to break up with me a few days later, I wasn't surprised at all. It was almost instantaneous; pretty much in that exact moment, I felt a little piece of me break off and die. The relationship with him wasn't a loss to me. But it was the final straw, and broke my romantic side.


Ever since then, I have no desire for dating. I am no longer able to find other people sexually attractive, be it male or female, and I actually find people less generally attractive now as well. My heart no longer flutters around anyone, and, somehow, I have actually become disgusted with the idea of romantic sex, or the idea of anyone I know engaging in sex. Unfortunately, my trust for other human beings was also completely crushed by all of this, and in the beginning of this revelation, that was the thing in the forefront of my mind telling me I don't want to date. Not only what I had gone through, but seeing what kind of cheating others around me were experiencing, killed any notion I had of any humans existing out there who would absolutely never cheat. At first, I thought something was really wrong with me, not because being Ace is wrong, but because it is so night and day of my usual self. I never would have guessed that one stupid, short relationship would affect me so deeply.


I still like the idea of romance in some things, but it's pretty rare. I usually only like it if it's not portrayed in any way sexual, and if it's very much fiction. For example, I love the romance of Sailor Moon, because it's innocent, and the love between Usagi and Mamoru is very pure. I love the characters, and always hope they end up together. Romantic scenes with real actors are harder for me to get into/support as a fan.


In my time alone these past 2 years, I've come to the conclusion that I don't even ever want sex with another person again. Yes, my body has a physical need for attention sometimes, but there's no reason I need another person for that. I can please myself without having to go through the trouble, drama, and stress of a relationship. I don't need to worry about pleasing another person when they desire it, and doing things that make me uncomfortable and kind of hate myself. I can still look at porn, but since these are just random people without any romantic setting, it doesn't bother me the way thinking of someone I know naked would.


I'm honestly not sure if I've always been some level of Ace, and just never allowed myself the alone time to discover myself, but today, I am without a doubt, very much Asexual. I feel like I'm blossoming into a more true version of myself, so I've come to accept this major shift in me. While I don't want a relationship right now, I have thought about one day trying to date another Ace, although the idea of lies/cheating still taunts me from the back of my mind, and it would take a lot for me to be able to put my faith into another person again. I can't even imagine trying to get into a relationship within the next few years.


I don't know if I'll ever be the same again, but I'm learning to love the freedom of being Ace. I feel much more in control of my life, and I feel like it's helping me grow as a person. I'm much more happy spending time with my dog than I ever was spending it with an SO, and I guess sleeping with a 90lb dog at night helps me realize that just because I'm not in a relationship, doesn't mean I'm alone in life.


I know this was a long read, but I wanted to put everything out there so that others can see just how wide a spectrum exists. Nothing is linear in life, and the Ace umbrella has a lot of room under it for all walks of people. I'm really curious to know if anyone else has experienced this same type of ""mental break"", but I'm not holding my breath. I know this isn't your typical Ace coming out story, but perhaps there are others out there like me.",Asexual
Not sure of anything,"25 years old virgin here. I am very  confused and any help is welcome.  
Well, at the beginning, when all my friends became sexually active (like ten years ago) I became distant because I did not have any explanation for what was happening with me and I hated when people started asking me stuff. I used to say that I was not interested bc I wanted to focus on school/college/etc... But now I have no excuse. 
I do feel attraction towards men and women (mostly pretty people), but as soon as it becomes reciprocate I run away.
I watch porn and I masturbate, but I have never felt the need to have sex with someone I know. However, I do have crushes on fictional characters .

Sorry about my english ",Asexual
Always overthinking and never really confident in myself,"\(Just FYI, I have posted this on r/asexuality, but I deleted that post and decided to post here instead. I've also posted something like this on AVEN and the reason I'm posting here is because I want to get more perspectives on this, and I still need to get this out, if that makes sense\).

I've been thinking about this for a while, and I think that I just kind of need to get this out there. Ever since I was young, I knew that I was attracted to the opposite sex, and I always identified as a male, just like I had been born. Up until maybe December of last year, I always thought that I was just straight, and there was nothing more to it. I was always open about a lack of interest in relationships and sex, and many people thought I was asexual, though I assured them that I wasn't \(for reasons I didn't specify\). I had masturbated for a long time, and I thought that pretty much disqualified me from being ace. I would also feel a sort of draw to look at people, most times based on clothing and such. I don't remember if I was ever aroused by it, but I don't thin that I was, though I still thought at the time that what I was doing would be called sexual attraction. I still experience a similar thing, though now I do get a slight tingle down under. I would definitely not call it full blown arousal, but just a small tingle. It has been slowly going away though, but I digress.

After I got over my first crush, which ended in December, I began to question myself. I don't remember exactly why, but I did some research, and was surprised to find out that I may be asexual. I began identifying with the term, and began to accept myself, but then I went through a large bunch of waves of self\-doubt. I had never been confident in any assertion that I made, and never trusted myself to find the right answer. I always relied on other people, because they would know better than me, and could confirm what I had concluded was valid. I was very much like this with identity. I asked a ton of question, and people responded, many saying that I may be asexual. But that just wasn't enough, and I still felt lost. I was the only person who could identify myself, but I was also the one person who's answers I didn't trust. 

I tried to look for the signs, and anything that I found I overanalyzed to the point of obsession. I asked a multitude of questions about it, here and on Reddit. People would do their best to give support, but it was just never enough, and I felt like I was betraying them. I just wanted to find the right answer, because even though I know it's not true, I view everything in black and white, right and wrong. I was either asexual, or wrong, and being wrong scared me. People said that ""You're valid"" but all I could think is that what I'm valid because I'm straight? I'm still wrong. I know that people change their identities, but having to possibly do that in the future scares me too. I would feel like I've just lied to myself forever. I've always wanted it to be diagnosable, with some sort of test. I wished a well\-established asexual could get inside my mind and say whether I was ace or not. I wanted something better than myself to tell me. 

Now here I am, with countless people saying that I could very well be ace, and even my parents thinking so to, even before I told them about it \(though they don't know about my masturbation and other deep feelings\). I feel like I'm going back into the labyrinth of self\-doubt. I'll include a little bit about why I think I may be ace below \(which is mostly copied from an older post because I'm too lazy to write this all again\).

I do masturbate \(as I mentioned before\), and look at stuff when I do \(and I do know doing so doesn't disqualify you from being ace\). I feel only the act really interests me \(and I only really do it because I'm bored and it feels good\). I don't have the thought when looking at someone of wanting to have sex specifically with them, and I just focus on whatever they're doing, rather than who's doing it. I also sometimes have difficulty with fantasies, though they have become easier for me \(although they have begun to die down, and aren't really a natural occurrence for me\) . I don't really imagine another person with me in it, just sort of an anonymous figure I can imagine a specific person, but that takes extra work and never really adds anything \(my fantasies are also gay sometimes, even though I have zero attraction to men, but those have also become much less frequent\). I'm indifferent to it at most, and I don't look at people and have a urge to have sex with them or anything. I have had a crush once, and all I wanted with her was just to spend time and stuff, nothing sexual. I've had people say that I may be slightly aromantic, but I don't think I am. I think that I also experience aesthetic attraction, where I have an urge to just sort of look at someone based only on appearance \(as I previously mentioned\), but I'm not sure because occasionally I get a small tingle in my nether regions. I wouldn't call it full blown arousal, and I don't really get an erection, but it's still a feeling there. Recently it's been happening less and less, and I think that the only reason that it happened in the first place was hormonal things \(I'm only 15\). And one last thing too, I know that I'm not demi because I feel that the closer that I get to someone, the more unappealing the idea of sex becomes. 

So that's it. I don't know if I know who I am anymore. Any thoughts on what I should do? Am I ace at all, or am I lying to myself?",Asexual

But, it feels like after having the libido of a horny 15 year old for years, right now and for the past few days at least, my mind doesn't really care about sex/romance.  Maybe a month ago, if women were to put my hand on her chest I honestly might have ejaculated immediately (due to lack of experience), but now it's like I don't even really care.  And it honestly feels nice in a way.  Of course, if there were to be real opportunities to develop a romantic and sexual relationship with a women around me, it might not be good to feel how I feel right now.  But, for basically anything else, the thoughts/feelings of sex/romance feel like huge a distraction.  Maybe my sexual/romantic side will re-activate under the right circumstances, but right now, if a women were to put my hand on her chest, I mean I might as well be putting my hand on my mailman's kneecap.

Do Asexuals Dream of Electric Sheep?,"NOTE: This is just a random/pointless dream I had.  I'm asexual and uninterested in sex, but not aromantic.  Sorry for the confusing changes in tense, I didn't want to edit it too much from my journal entry that I wrote when I had the dream.

Tears trickled down my neck, a warm body on my left side, her sobs shaking both her body &amp; mine. Shhh. I comforted her, a deep, soothing noise. Still, she cried – broken noise – loud at my side. Her lamentations pierced my ear, pierced my soul, her grief poisoned me. My heart was so pained by her pain, I could do nothing but hold her as her hurt bled out.

Slowly, the sobs that had wracked her small frame reduced to gasping breaths and gently falling tears whose smack against the floors was drowned out by the *pitter\-patter* of the rain. “Are you okay?” I whisper in my calmest voice. She hugged me tighter but gave me an affirmative. I extricated myself from her arms and took her small paw into my giant hand.

Slowly, I guided her down the hall, the old oak planks creaking mournfully, the rain pattering plentifully now, the lights fluctuating in strength with the storm, slowly I guided her. My pale skin stood out against the dim light of the hall, while her darker tone stood starkly against the cream white wall. We reached the bronze doorknob marking the end of our journey.

Her breath had now assuaged, no longer hitched gasps, more of a deep intake followed by sniffles. My shirt is soaked with tears, a cold, wet patch on the left breast. With a comically theatric flourish, I pull back the comforter and sheet, earning me a weary smile. She crawled into bed, and I tuck her in. As I head to the door, a small voice says “You can stay. Please.”

My heart raced. I love her, but not like this. Her heart, however, ravaged by turmoil, I could not bear to pain with my rejection. I turn slowly and creep back to the bed. She pulled back the comforter as I take off my tear\-stained shirt, and crawl into bed beside her. Still shivering from the strength of her emotions, her warm hands trail across my stomach and chest ending in a fierce embrace that firmly attached her to my right side. “Hold me.”

“Okay.” I do. My arms wrap around her small frame, engulfing her shoulders and upper back into a bear hug of sorts. Over the course of minutes, she shifts my arms and herself until I hug her lower back and the safe half\-foot I had placed between our faces was reduced to a mere two inches, if that. Her body radiated heat for the both of us, her breath tickled my cheek, her fingers tousled my hair. She drew closer till our lips almost touched. I could see the trails from which tears had fallen and the bloodshot, red\-rimmed eyes that had cried them.

I was struck then by the profound strength of will she possessed. She could cry, while I was unable. She could feel, while I could not. I \- unfeeling, uncrying, imperfect \- was holding a being whose beauty I could never match.

As she stared into my eyes, she locked out lips softly, gently. With loving care, I pull my head back. “I can’t.”

“But I need you to.”

“I know, but I can’t.”

I untangle myself from her and flee the room, grabbing the gorgeous bronze knob and flinging the door open, an unshed tear that would never escape the prison of my eye blurring the sight of the creaky oak floor and white cream walls. Adrenaline floods my system, panic fills my being, my heart races out of my chest, my soul pained by my weakness, and I begin to feel guilt creeping into my psyche, even before her renewed sobs pierce my ear.

"Not Asexual, but looking for advice.","As the title states, I am not an asexual, but the woman I'm currently dating is. She (F28) and I (M28) have been maintaining a long distance relationship for a few weeks, after having grown close over a few months. She identifies (and forgive me if I'm using an incorrect term) as an Asexual Romantic, though has admitted to potentially being demi, but has never had a relationship with someone she'd be willing to look into that with. 

Now, I'm not one to hinge a relationships on maybes, and while the option of demi would be a good compromise, its not something she can choose to be. What I do hinge the relationship on is what it is: one of the healthiest and happiest I've ever been in. I'm in love with this girl, and I want to make sure I'm treating her and her stance with the utmost respect. 

My question is, has anyone here had any experience with a relationship between a sexual and asexual person and know ways in which this kind of relationship is approached? I've had one friend (who is polyamorous) suggest the romantic partner and the  physical partner, but I cannot abide the idea, because even if she were fine with it and gave permission, it would feel too much like cheating (one of many reasons I could never be poly).

Changing romantic orientations.,"Hi! I have, for a couple months now, been identifying as Asexual Pan-Lithromantic. However, during the time I identified as this, I rarely left the house and didn't really interact with others. I am now going out, going to school, and I'm wondering if it is no longer fitting. I'm not entirely sure I even experience romantic attraction, at least not anymore. I haven't had a 'crush' in 2 years, butterflies, nervous, wanting to talk to them, all that. There are a ton of people I find super cute and think, ""I would date them,"" but that isn't attraction I don't think. Some days, I want to be in a relationship, but the idea of actually being in one makes me uncomfortable and I avoid it because it freaks me out. Other days, the thought of being in a relationship is just weird and unappealing. 
The weirdest thing for me is that, I will see people, example this one girl at my school. She's really cute, and I could totally see myself in a relationship with her. I don't necessarily 'want' to be, but I would if she was interested? 

I'm just confusing myself. Finding a fitting label is important to me, because I otherwise just feel super weird because I don't know anyone else who looks at relationships like I do.
I've been researching orientations. Quoromantic, Schromantic, Cupioromantic, Quasiromantic.

Aces and demis who are married - how did you identify your relationship needs and share those with your partner?,"Background: I will have been married for 4 years this month, and have recently realized I'm on the less-sexual side of the spectrum. Luckily, my husband has a girlfriend and she very happily satisfies his sexual needs.

In the past I tried to center relationships around sex. I've recently come to realize that was a result of social training and low self-worth rather than actual desire. 

These days: I've now realized that sex is so much less important to me than I had thought or pretended. I'm glad my metamour can help fulfill his needs, but I often find myself jealous of their closeness. For the last two years, as I've slowly discovered my actual sexual desires, my husband and I have grown apart.

I find I'm often confused by or can't determine what I actually want and need from a relationship. Is it touching? Cuddling? Occasional sex? No sex?

It's difficult for me to pin these things down and then to bring them up. I get so emotional when we try to talk about these things, I think mostly because I feel inadequate (imperfect) and I don't really know what I want or how to express that.

TLDR: I'm looking for any tools or worksheets or advice that can help me pin down my long-term relationship needs in light of learning that I'm ace/demi.",Asexual

A new ace stereotype: Terrorist!,"Hey hi everyone,

A few days ago there was a terrible terrible tragedy in Toronto Canada… A man with the name Alek Minassian drove into a group of shopping people because (assuming from the known evidence) he hated women. He was part of the Incel community. Incel stands for involuntarily celibate, men who want sex, but can’t get it. 

Today I was halted by a good friend of mine, and he wanted to talk to me in private. He is one of the only people irl that know I’m Ace and he began interrogating me to see if I were a terrorist… He began thinking I wasn’t ace but an Incel. Logically, I became very mad at him. My friends who do know all don’t understand how someone can be ace. But then I started to freak a little… Did everyone who knew I was ace suspect I was a terrorist? I asked a few people and most didn’t think that but they all said it’s crossed their minds…

Did any of you guys experience anything like this in the last week? Or more weird stares or something?



**Sidenote: I don’t want to sound like this is the biggest problem. It isn’t. A lot of people lost their loved ones after the attack and they have it much much worse! And I don’t want to make this about the ace community (since we aren’t involuntarily sexless) but it was linked quite fast to this community. That being said, I think I speak for every single Ace person in the whole world that we distance ourselves from this tragedy and that we all live with the victims and their families.**

Coming out has been really hard.,"A lot of people don't think I ""seem"" asexual. They don't get why I chose to identify with asexuality. ""its just because you have a low libido."" ""you've had sex before, you've masturbated before."" I wasn't expecting to get the reaction I did from my close friends. I'm bummed. 


Yes I've had sex before because that's what I thought I was supposed to do, it's supposed to be fun and its supposed to feel great, but it just felt great for my parter. I would continue to have sex just so that my partner would be happy. I've been cheated on so many times because of my lack of desire to have sex, and it's sad because it's forced me to accept being happy with an open relationship. I've felt broken, like a woman who can't do what a woman should.


Just because I've had sex and just because I've masturbated, it doesn't mean that I can't be asexual. I don't think I can be open about it with my friends anymore which feels shitty. Sorry for venting.",Asexual
I feel like I was born on the wrong planet,"I used to think those Autistic people saying that they were on the wring planet was a dumb thing, like the planet isn't made for one type of person, the world not catering to your every need does not mean you were born on the wrong planet. But now I see what they are talking about.

But after talking to some people, I do feel like I am born in the wrong planet because the world is so sexual. I don't want people to view me in a sexual way, but people do, and I can't do anything about it. Sex is natural but I hate it. I think sex has caused a lot of problems in this world, it may be the root of sexism, I wish there was no gender, so without sex my life would be a dream come true. But you need sex to create another human being, and without sex we would not be here. If we reproduced asexually, then we would all be clones of each other with maybe some mutations here and there. 

I wish I could control other other people's minds, and they wouldn't look at me like that, but best I can do is live in my own little world and pretend that they are not thinking that. 

I wish I could walk around topless without guys looking in a sexual way. I wish others were topless, so I could see how normal boobs looked, and not worry if there was something wrong with mine. I wish other women weren't sexually or romantically needy, so other men couldn't out that on me. I wish sex differences, hormonal differences didn't exist. 

Sex is such a boring thing, so when other people talk about it, i feel left out of the conversation since I can't really add anything. I view the world in a completely different way, which is something I didn't realize at first. It sounds trivial that a sexuality can make your mind operate so differently, but sex can be a big part of life for someone who isn't asexual. 

I hate the quote ""Everything is about sex, except sex, sex is about power."" Because first you assume that it is the man overpowering the women, and second, why does power even matter? Why can't we all be helpful to each other a create a better world?

I hate biology, and I hate god. 

td:lr: I wish the world wasn't sexual, so that I could live the life I want, and so that people could see me for my intelligence and ideas, and not think about sex. I hate many symptoms of a sexual world as well. I think transcending biology is the next important step in our species, but that may not happen until death.

Do you think I should come to my family?,"Some advice/insight, maybe personal stories of how coming out to family went, or anything like that would really help me. 

To give you some background: I'm in my early 20's, in college and single (aro/ace). Both my mother and sister tend to be very romantic people, they both started dating and married pretty young (they're both straight) and they are happy in their relationships.

Since I was about 12, I've felt pressured by them to talk about my non-existent crushes, if there were any celebrities I found hot, things like that. I distinctly remember being 14 when my sister asked me if I wanted to date any boy for Valentine's day and impulsively saying, ""Oh, I don't really like boys"", and my sister giving me a weird and almost disgusted look before asking me if I liked girls instead. I said no and we never talked about it again. I should say that my family is not at all supportive of queer people, if you didn't already guess that. I've had similar awkward conversations with my mom.

Now, my mother and sister seem to be honestly worried about me. It seems that if I were a lesbian, it would be easier for them to understand since at least I would be sexually and romantically into someone. I've never dated, had sex or even kissed. When questioned about this by my sister, I've only ever shrugged and said I didn't care about that part of life. My family thinks that is insane.

My mother seems to be concerned that I am desperately lonely and sad without a relationship, so she attempts to lecture me to ""open up to love"" and find someone to make me experience more of ""what real adult life is about"". That's irritating and hurtful to me, but understandable from her perspective. 

Do you think telling her about asexuality would help her to see that I'm not crazy, this is a legitimate sexuality (or lack of one)? I have some hope that it could go somewhat decently. I can't say the same for telling her I'm aromantic, she would for sure think I'm mentally disturbed. How else could I get it across to my family that I'm not super lonely or sexually frustrated, just uninterested in sex and romance?

Gynecologist-Anxiety,"Hello everybody!
So a bit of info about me first: I identify as asexual and aromantic since a little over a year, but I already had a hunch before when everyone was started showing interest in sex/romance and I didnt. I'm pretty much touch averse as well, like I hate being touched most of the time (there are exceptions but that's very person and situation based).
Because I never had the desire for engaging in sexual activities there was never a ""need"" to go to a gynecologist, since most people start going there when they have their first relationship.
However, ever since puberty I did notice having more hair growth (talking about facial hair) for a girl, and when my acne wouldn't go away the thought accured to me that I might have a hormonal imbalance. My mom suggested to me going to the gynecologist for this so they could give me something to balance my hormones, but I couldn't quite tell her why I feel so uncomfortable going there.
Also, I'm not 100% sure what my question boils down to exactly, but any sort of experience from other aces with similar circumstances/ any advice on what I could do about this would be much appreciated.
Thanks to everyone in advance!

I suspect meth and porn have made me asexual,"Hey there... So I'm a 33 year old male, who used be quite a slut all through my 20s... Until about 7 years ago I discovered meth, and have been addicted ever since.  While using meth I stopped caring about sex, but I did develop an out of control porn addiction... I just lost complete interest in sex with an actual person. I've actually turned down sex countless times in favor of getting high. The problem is, now that I'm clean from drugs, my sex drive isn't returning. Nor do I even want to watch porn. Im starting to suspect these addictions have caused me to be asexual. It's been about 5 years since I've had sex, and honestly I can't even remember how to initiate it into happening.

(X-post r/asexuality) Need Advice on Budding Mixed Relationship,"Hello friends, I need your help. Or maybe I just need to tell my story and hear from others who have been in a similar position. I'm not sure. I apologize in advance for the sloppy wall of text, and the tangents.

First of all, this post isn't about me, or at least not about my identity. I'm a gay man, and I am allosexual. I'm posting here because I've been seeing another guy, Jack (not his real name) for a month or two now, who I'm really attracted to, physically and emotionally, and he told me last night that he is Asexual, right before we went to sleep. Let me back up and provide some context.

Jack and I actually met several years back on Grindr, while I was in an open relationship (with someone, now that I think about it, who, while he never used the term asexual, was not sexual with me, and I was fine with that. Hence the open relationship). I remember that first night when we met, we fooled around a bit, but then just fell asleep without actually having sex. I actually really liked that, and didn't think much of it, but now when I look back I can't help but feel like maybe I have more context now knowing what I know.

The next time we met was when my boyfriend at the time and I met up with Jack for a threesome. We had a good time overall, but I did get the feeling that Jack might have been more attracted to my boyfriend than me. Or that may have just been something my (now ex)boyfriend said. I'm not really sure if I ever had that feeling on my own, or if it was influenced by his perception, so I try to put it out of my mind.

Fast forward to early this year, or maybe late last year. I'm single, and I end up talking to Jack on Grindr again, and he wants to hookup. I was excited to hear that, because as I said earlier, I find him very attractive. So we hook up, and I have a great time, and as far as I could tell so did he. I'm pretty sure I remember cuddling for a while after, which I really enjoy. However, at this point, in large part due to the fact that our relationship has only ever been sexual, and I seem to be very bad at reading him, I'm under the impression that he is only sexually attracted to me.

In February, I had an event that I wanted to go to, but I wanted to go there with someone as a date. In an act of desperation/courage I asked him if he would be interested in going with me. (I didn't really expect him to say yes, at this point I was asking people I had no business asking.) To my surprise, he said he couldn't as he would be on a cruise, but that he would like to go on a date with me sometime. So after he got back, we went to go see Love, Simon (which is beautiful btw), got dinner after, had drinks at a favorite gay bar of ours, and spent the night at his apartment. We had such a great night. We didn't do anything sexual that night, just cuddling in bed, and I actually really liked that. I think it helped reassure me that he was genuinely interested in me, and not just sex (remember, from my point of view, our relationship had been pretty strictly sexual up until this point). He would later go on to tell me that he had liked me ever since the first night we met, which really meant a lot to me.

We've been seeing each other once a week almost every week since then, about a month and a half. (There was one week where we didn't see each other because he was feeling pretty depressed, not feeling up to going out anywhere, and didn't realize I would be fine with staying in with him. He wasn't very responsive that weekend, more so than usual (he's already not very good about responding quickly when we text) but I've dealt with depression off and on for years, so I understand. We had a conversation about it and worked through some of the issues then). The more time I spend with him, and the more I get to know him, the more I like him as a person. I'm also super insecure, but I feel like he gets me, like we understand each other, as long as there is a strong line of communication open. And that's something I've been working really hard to establish.

So I went over last night to watch Cloud Atlas and spend the night. (now Jack had spent the day helping his friend move, who then paid him in beer. So he had a few before I came over and while we were watching). In Cloud Atlas, there is a scene where one of the gay characters kills himself, just as his lover is about to be reunited with him, and this was a very difficult scene for Jack to watch, as he has lost several people in his life to suicide, including romantic partners. He started to cry, and to move away. I tried to move closer to him so I could try to console him, but he made it clear he needed some space, and I respected that, but it was extremely difficult to just sit there and do nothing while he was hurting. I don't know, there probably wasn't anything I could have done to help, but it hurts to accept that. I'm crying now just thinking about it. I'm not sure how relevant this is, but I feel like hopefully it shows how much I care about Jack, how important he is to me. He tried to apologize after the movie for getting emotional and I told him that he didn't have anything to apologize for.

So we went to bed that night, and right before he goes to sleep, he tells me that he is asexual, but very romantic, and that he hopes that I'm ok with that. I was surprised, but I said to him ""you don't need my permission to be who you are"", and gave him a hug. I asked him, trying to make sense of things, whether this was something he had come to realize recently, to which he answered yes. I didn't want to push any further than that, as it was late, and I want him to be comfortable having a more detailed conversation with me when the time comes. I don't want to rush him. He fell asleep after that, but I couldn't fall asleep for a few hours.

We went to get breakfast this morning, and I told him that, when he was comfortable doing so, I wanted to have a more in depth conversation about what he told me last night, so I could better understand, and that it didn't change how I felt about him. I'm still trying to figure out what this means for us. I know there are ways to make mixed relationships work, but I can't figure any of that out until we have that conversation.

This is pretty much what happened with my identity, and even after ID'ing as ace for a little while, I slipped back into a spell of self-doubt, and kept asking ""am I ace?"" questions (in fact, I still need to somewhat hold myself back to not post my whole story and feelings here and ask for thoughts on where I belong). It was hard, and the answers that I did get weren't enough. I felt like I was almost failing the people that responded. Recently, however, I decided to look at signs of asexuality, and I came closer than ever to sorting out my self doubt. So, because of this, I would like to ask what are some of the signs of asexuality, or signs of at least being on the spectrum in some capacity. I know that the absence of sexual attraction is the big one, but that's kind of hard to understand. I want to look at them and then evaluate how I feel, and just think about it a lot. I would also just like to say that signs about how one feels in relationships aren't applicable to me (I've only had one unreciprocated crush, and I'm forever alone). You can add them if you feel that it'll help people other than me though. Thanks for any replies.",Asexual
What does being Asexual mean to you?,"Hello r/Asexual! I came across this subreddit and i have noticed that many people have different interpretations and classifications of what being asexual is. I think asexuality is interesting and i would like to understand and relate to this community more. Therefore as the title says, what does being asexual mean to you?",Asexual

Am I Really Going Against Nature?,"As the title represents, I hear the phrase ""going against nature"" directed at me for the choices I have made such as not dating or wanting ""it,"" but it still hurts to hear that occasionally due to the fact that most people think humans are supposed to procreate and continue the existence of the species. I haven't really told people I'm ace (to what degree, I'm not sure yet, but a lot of people sensed that within the vibes I give), mainly because of this, and the fact they would probably treat me like some kind of outcast. I know they mean well, but I feel like they'd just abandon me or treat me differently.

Anyway, what are you thoughts on this? I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I can't help but constantly focus on this since a lot of people seem to think I'm going against nature. Sorry if this seems long and uninteresting.",Asexual
I feel like I've failed and haven't gotten anywhere,"(I have posted something like this on AVEN, but I feel I should also do so here)

So, this is a quick rant and even though I've posted a lot about this sort of stuff before I feel that I need to get this off my chest. I've sort of identified with the asexual label for a little while now, but I've been going through a lot of self doubt lately and I feel like I'm still stuck at square one. I always feel uncertain of a lot of things in my life, especially my feelings, so I tend to over analyze them which leads to me doubting myself more, but I can't help it. I also don't have very much confidence in anything that I think of, which is why I go to the internet so much for this sort of this. I've asked tons of questions online because I feel that they know and understand asexuality better than I can and would thus have a better understanding of where I could be. So I posted and posted a ton, trying to see what people said about me and then think about about it, but it never stopped. I could never come to any conclusion, and now I feel that I've been dragged back to the start. I feel like I've failed all those people that have tried to help me. And I feel like a fraud, just grouped into the group because I'm not quite sure, and sometimes I feel like I don't belong and I'm just lying to myself. Someone that doesn't belong. I will provide context below as to how I sort of feel, so if you have thoughts on where I am based on that those would be nice.
 

Although I do masturbate, and look at stuff when I do, I feel only the act really interests me (and I only really do it because I'm bored and it feels good). I don't have the thought when looking at someone of wanting to have sex specifically with them, and I just focus on whatever they're doing, rather than who's doing it. I also sometimes have difficulty with fantasies, though they have become easier for me. I don't really imagine another person with me in it, just sort of an anonymous figure (also it's somewhat become my natural inclination for them to be gay, which I think is weird because I have no attraction to men). I can imagine a specific person, but that takes extra work and never really adds anything. I'm indifferent to it at most, and I don't look at people and have a urge to have sex with them or anything. I have had a crush once, and all I wanted with her was just to spend time and stuff, nothing sexual. I think that I also experience aesthetic attraction, where I have an urge to just sort of look at someone based only on appearance, but I'm not sure because occasionally I get a small tingle in my nether regions. I wouldn't call it full blown arousal, and I don't really get an erection, but it's still a feeling there. That feeling does go away very quickly, but sometimes comes back  I also kind of identify with the fraysexual label, but I haven't for a long time because I was afraid of people's reactions and if I even belonged on the spectrum at all. I feel like that because that feeling that I described earlier doesn't really happen again after a little while (but sometimes comes back for no reason). The more I know the person, the more the idea of sex with them repulses me. I don't know, I just over analyze everything that I feel and I can't stop.

 

I'm so sorry, I'm not sure for what, but I am.

frustrated trying to get people to understand Asexuality,"I was tired of people asking me at work why I didn't have a girlfriend/boyfriend, so I told them about being asexual. This was months ago. Ever since I feel like every week I have to reexplain that I'm not EVER going to get married or have a relationship with someone. It's like they think I'm kidding or joking or running some kind of long con. Yet every single week I hear ""I don't understand how you don't like anyone"" or ""How can you say you're not going to get married you don't KNOW that for sure.""

the last question is the most frustrating for me. I'm 29 years old I THINK I KNOW WHAT I LIKE AND DON'T LIKE. 

I have zero desire for a boyfriend or girlfriend. I have zero desire to have sex with someone. 

People I work with constantly complain about relationships. Two are divorced and one is single, and they think I'M weird for not wanting a relationship at all.

"Asexuality vs. sexual but repressed, help me? [NSFW]","Hey, so, I'm 23, male. Basically, I'm a straight/bi-curious guy who loves to cuddle, I get just as horny as the average guy and I masturbate, but I don't really think about sex.

BACKGROUND: I was raised extremely religious (Mormon). Basically, they teach that any sexual ""sins"" are akin to murder. Because of this, I would ""block"" any thoughts in my head that I got of a woman's breasts, vagina, or any part that was covered by a bikini. This is still going on to an extent; I have rarely ever watched porn involving nudity. However, I did today, I watched a porno and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I do have some sexual fantasies, but they usually involve having a girl watch me get off.

I didn't start masturbating until I was 15. My low sex drive might be explained by the fact that I was on SSRIs (fucking hate those things) starting when I was 8 until I was 15.

When I see a woman who's really hot, I get turned on, but my desire leads me to masturbate and it's difficult for me to conjure up a sexual fantasy - likely because of how little porn I watch. When I have gone for periods of not watching porn, my natural desire for sex seems to materialize.

This is going to offend some people on here, but I am afraid of being asexual. I know in the back of my mind that I probably am not, but could I have some advice? **Do you think these are religious hangups or something else?**",Asexual

(As a small preface, I'm just going to include a bit of background info first. Sorry if it's lengthy and not too related to it)

So, I've ID'd as somewhere on the ace spectrum for a while now for a few reasons. Although I do masturbate, and look at stuff when I do, I feel only the act really interests me (and I only really do it because I'm bored and it feels good). I don't have the thought when looking at someone of wanting to have sex specifically with them, and I just focus on whatever they're doing, rather than who's doing it.

That feeling does go away very quickly, but sometimes comes back  I also kind of identify with the fraysexual label, but I haven't until now because I was afraid people wouldn't view me as a real ace. I feel like that because that feeling that I described earlier doesn't really happen again after a little while (but sometimes comes back for no reason). The more I know the person, the more the idea of sex with them repulses me. 

 

This has been happening to me for a while, and I wanted to ask if anyone else dealt with it like I did. Right now I'm going through a phase of self-doubt, and it's not the first time. I feel that I go through these phases, and I really don't like it. I'm sort of beginning to feel like I'll just be stuck in an endless loop of self-doubt. I find it hard for me to tell myself what I'm actually feeling, as I have a hard time recognizing my own feelings, and thus have very little self confidence. I've often wished to be aro or sex-repulsed, or there was some sort of scientifically supported test that I could take. Heck, I've wished to have asexual people view the world from my eyes and tell me if I fit in. But sometimes I'm just able to make it click and accept myself before I flip back to this. Does anyone else feel similar, and does anyone have any help or advice for me (based on this and the background)?

Where I belong

And I realize that they were  
Never even there.

I think I might be ace,"I've never enjoyed sex. In college I gave sex to anyone who showed interest but I never enjoyed. Like, I dated another woman for five months and didn't orgasm once. I haven't had sex for quite a few years now and it doesn't bother me. I'm lonely, but for companionship, not physical intimacy. I do worry that my lack of interest could stem from low hormone levels (I'm sterile), mental illness, and past sexual trauma. I do masturbate, but the scenarios I conjure to get off are so out there that I'd have trouble replicating them in real life even if I wanted to, which I don't. All in all, I'm not sure what label I fit under, or if it's even worth the trouble.",Asexual

Coming out as ace or keeping it a secret,"So I’ve known I was asexual for just over ten years now. I recently turned 24.

I’ve resigned myself to keeping it a secret apart from some social media. IRL, I just don’t find that I could comfortably come out to the people around me. Well, recently my friend came out as bi to me and I reciprocated...to an extent. I’m birom/akoirom + asexual. And when she came out, I was basically like, “cool, me too” but didn’t mention being ace or anything.

I’ve only had one person ever kind of inquire about me being asexual (but she also like I’m 90% sure had no idea what it was, just kinda knew I was basically not into relationships and was probably gonna be that way for life) and I basically had a panic attack after when I was finally alone. Idk, we were with another friend and they were talking very animatedly about how a guy should propose and I just kinda sat there when one turned to me and basically accused me of not caring or not wanting to get married or something and the other person just blew it off with a “lol that’s just how she is”. It’s a bit of a blur now, but it’s all I could think about for like a week after it happened lol

Another person I know IRL knows, but only because we met online where I was already out about being asexual. She ended up going to university in a big city only a few hours from me and so whenever I visit by myself, we try to hang out for a little bit. But talking about it with her is never a *thing*

So anyway, I’m ok with not coming out to anyone. I just figured that’s how it was gonna be. I don’t have anything that might remotely show any kind of pride (flag, ring, what have you). I actually find the akoirom flag colors to be very pretty, but I’d maybe rather die than expose myself like that lololol (to be fair, I live/grew up in a fairly conservative city soooo)

Anyway, then my friend and I got back in touch after a few years of no contact because of life and she came out as bi and I’m starting to consider coming out like all the way to her. I kinda feel like I’m lying to her if I don’t. And I know I shouldn’t feel that way because it’s my life, my decision.

Whenever I’ve thought about coming out to someone though, I feel like my heart is gonna jump out. And honestly, I might wuss out when we see each other in a few days. We’ll see haha it feels good to like lay it all out there though rather than keeping it all bottled up until I explode on Tuesday or something

**Anyway, I was just curious about other aces’ choice about telling people or not telling people.** I’m not really asking for advice about my situation, I’m sure I’ll come to my own conclusion on what I’m gonna do eventually. **I just wanna know what you’ve decided, maybe why you’ve decided on that choice, and if you think that choice may change??**",Asexual

"After three years of identifying as asexual, I am now 18 and wondering if maybe I was just a “late bloomer” after all.","I’ve been in denial of this for a while now because it really hurts. I’ve identified as asexual for years now, visited this sub every day, and feel a close kinship with the community. But I don’t think I’m asexual anymore. I think I’m bisexual.

I’ve called myself “gray ace” for a while now because I masturbate and all. But I have an insanely high libido and the smallest things can trigger my desires... I feel like it goes above gray asexuality, especially because I have a want to actually have sex with people. 

I still don’t watch porn and I’m very “vanilla” in my desires, but I don’t think I can call myself asexual. It just doesn’t feel correct anymore. 

I definitely did not have sexual feelings before. This is a new development, so am I just an 18 year old “late bloomer”?  I really am trying to believe it’s not true. I want to be asexual.

My parents will never be grandparents,"I’m sex-repulsed, and I also don’t care too much for children. So it suffices to say that I never plan on having kids.

My only other sibling is gay, so unless he ends up adopting (which doesn’t seem too likely — he’s told me that he doesn’t really want to have children either), he will also never have kids.

Sometimes I feel a little bad for my parents that they will never get to have grandchildren. 

I know that my aunt has been pushing her son and daughter-in-law to have kids because she really wants to be a grandmother (it’s pretty fucked up if you ask me, but i’ve come to realize that a desire to have a family — spouse, kids, grandkids — is normal for most people). 

I’ve kind of discussed it with my mother. How I never want children and how my brother will also likely never have children, and she’ll never get to be a grandmother. I asked her what she thought about it. Her response was (paraphrasing), “I would love to have grandchildren! But it really doesn’t bother me one way or the other.” 

My mom has definitely always tried to be understanding of us. So I can’t quite tell if her response was a genuine indifference, or if she’s just trying to show acceptance of our choices. 

And I have no idea what my dad’s thoughts are about it.

Asexuality and the LGBT community? Discussion,"So, actually not so much of my mind. I was having a discussion the other day with one of two friends who know I'm asexual. He himself is gay and we got to talking about a project I'm doing for college involving representation of the LGBT community. I joked that they represented everyone except the asexuals and he, point blank, looked at me and said it was no surprise.

I've seen people w/in the LGBT community who think asexuality has no place and sort of felt hurt thinking he might feel the same way. But he waved off that notion quickly.

""The thing with asexuality, barring the nonromantics, is it doesn't automatically mean you're attracted to straight people only. There can be gay asexuals or lesbian asexuals. Transgender asexuals. I don't think asexuality is a sexual orientation because its more the absence of sex in most cases.

I don't want all the games and the tests which comes with it. I guess that's enough reason for me not to want a girlfriend. This girl I've been talking to has been mentioning other guys and stuff I'm no expert but I think she was trying to make me jealous.

Opinions (and confession) about Fraysexuality,"So, I was just wondering if anyone had any views on this to share, and I would also like to put my experience here. When I first started researching asexuality I came upon the term and identified quite a bit with it. I feel that any semblance of sexual attraction that I may have (or the beginning of it) goes away pretty quickly, or the more I think about it. However, as I scrolled down, people said that it wasn't really a real thing, or that it didn't belong under the ace umbrella. Because of that, I became afraid to identify with it, as I felt that it would alienate me. What do you think about it?",Asexual
Have the urge... Then it's gone,"I tend to get the urge to want to have sex, I get flirty, even talk about having sex. But when it gets right down to it, either I'm there or nearly there, when the very thought of getting all up in someone else's personal fluids just squicks me out. I then have absolutely no desire to proceed. I'm not talking about protection or not. The act of getting that personal with someone else makes me wonder whatever was I thinking.

Does anyone else have this sort of self-sabotaging mind?",Asexual
Will the little voice ever go away?,"Hi,
I’m very open about being ace, online (50% of my post on Reddit are on this sub😂) and in real life. I’m almost a 100 percent sure I’m ace. 
But still, there is always that little voice in the back of my head… Maybe it’s the voice of what society has told me, maybe it’s the pressure to be “normal”, whatever it is, it is there... The voice of doubt, thinking things like “Are you really Asexual? Because you don’t know if you could fall for a female if you’ve never done it before. And what about life? You’re 17! Do you really plan to spend your whole life alone?!? You’re just afraid for something real! You need to man up and find a female and marry her and have children! The whole package! But no. You’re wasting your time... You are fucking your life up, ironically enough...”
I don’t know if this is normal? Do more people experience this or something alike? And will it ever stop? Please let me know, thank you.

Edit: To clarify, I’m not doubting if I’m ace. It’s more like “I hate being this, can’t I just be normal?” And the voice telling me that kinds of stuff",Asexual
Haven’t felt sexual attraction in months,"While the title says most of it, I have had a few casual hookups. Not sure what drove me, maybe looking for someone who could change my mind. In these hookups I never actually “finished” and never felt satisfied by it. I still find women objectively attractive, but feel no sexual attraction. I don’t really know where this post is going, I just wanted to get this off my chest and see how other people feel, or even they’re opinions on my situation.",Asexual
I have low estrogen levels and am questioning everything,"I'm a teenager, never felt attracted sexual attraction to anyone I don't think. But unlike what the stickied thread said, I definitely care that I might be asexual. Also, I get minor crushes on guys and am definitely ""sensually attracted"" - I love hugs and cuddling, and my crushes usually entail wanting to have a romantic relationship and be with someone, but not have sex necessarily... 

Unlike what the stickied thread said ""most asexuals don't care that they're asexual"", I deeply desire a loving, healthy relationship, and I'm guessing that will be much harder to achieve if I'm asexual, as few guys will want to marry someone they can't have sex with. So I don't know if I'm asexual, because I care about finding a good relationship a lot. 

In addition, I just found out I have low estrogen levels (possibly due to a genetic disorder) and am now taking estrogen pills, but starting off on small doses. I'm both worried I will change and start liking sex, something I find gross, and also nervously excited to be ""normal"". 

I don't know if I'm asexual, so I guess I just wanted to ask if you can be asexual if you have low estrogen levels and want to be ok with sex but aren't?",Asexual
How to “come out” to people you’re romantically attracted to?,"I’ll keep it short, but I just met a guy that  I get along with really well and we have really good conversations.

I politely declined, saying that I had class early the next morning. I knew before meeting up that he is very sex-driven and I’m now feeling really guilty for pursuing meeting up with him but not telling him I’m asexual. He just suggested we meet up again soon, and I don’t know if I should go even for it or if that’s an appropriate time to come out. Should I have told him right as soon as I learned he was sex-driven?",Asexual

Ignorance makes asexuality and aromatics untrue.,"Hi, as always, here is a small back story: 17, male, Ace and Lith.

So the title is maybe a bit clickbaity but it brings the point across.
My best friend recently went on a date with a girl, the guy isn't super open minded and I think that he doesn't really believe me but just acts like it. So on the date he went and ate pizza with this girl on a bench just outside the place. He was going for the price and made the first move: Wrapping his arm around her. She dodges his arm, and apologized. ""No sorry it's just that I'm aromantic"". So he respected that and later (When he was going home) he texted me and asked me a few things about the whole aro thing. Later I asked him if he knew for certain that she was aro, and he texted her like he didn't no a thing about it. ""Uh aromantic means that you can't fall in love right?"" And what she replied is the whole reason asexuality and aromantic people aren't taken seriously! She replied: ""No that's asexuality, aromantic is just bad at romance.""

...

My blood is boiling! I get so pissed from these types of people! They are screaming that they are aromantic without knowing even the MEANING behind the word! Let alone that people she tells are being miss informed and once in, it's hard to get out of people! 

So to al you lovely peeps reading this: No matter who you are, and no matter what you identify with: Read about it and don't go calling yourself something if you don't know the entire meaning! Even outside sexuality and romance! Google it at least!

So does Ignorance makes asexuality and aromatics untrue? Yes and no. It's still a real thing, but ignorance and unknowing can ruïn alot and make people think something is ""untrue"" ",Asexual
I don't know what to do about myself and it scares me.,"Tonight wasn't a good night. For some context, about an hour ago I had been at a girl's place that I have been speaking to for a while now. It comes to the point in the night where we're hooking up and it's getting slightly passionate...but then nothing. She's an attractive girl but I felt absolutely no urge to sleep with her, even in the heat of the moment. And this isn't the first time it's happened either. This is the third time now where I've been kissing a girl (who wants to sleep with me) and then my brain just...idk. No matter how hard I tell myself that sex is a normal everyday thing, deep down I don't want to do it. I don't feel the need or want to have sex and that scares me deeply. Family and friend's think I'm this 'player' because I have great chemistry with girls, something that my friends slightly envy me for...but I feel like a total joke and a loser. All I really want is meaningful companionship with my other, someone that I can kiss from time to time. The thought of sex scares me, and the two times I 'did it' were awful. Not because I was bad or she was bad but because I didn't want to be in that situation, no matter how much I feel compelled and pressured. 

Also, I've only ever properly watched porn three or four times in my life and I hate it. I don't know why. 

I'm sick of being like this. I want to WANT to have sex, I want to experience what all my horny friends feel, the urges...but I just don't. I'm generally a happy guy but this has been in the back of head for a long long time now and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone with this, it isn't my intention at all. I think normally it'd be fine to be asexual but personally I can't stand it. Deep down I know I'd be perfect in a platonic relationship but at the same time I just want to be 'normal'.

Possibility of being asexual?,"All my life I have never once felt the want to have sex with a certain person, male or female. Or kiss them for that matter. Tbh I don't really enjoy making out at all. So because of this I am a 24 years old virgin, well I guess until yesterday, but the last year I really changed my style and got really feminine and stuff (not because I want guys to be attracted to me I guess I suddenly just got rly interested in fashion and makeup), so suddenly I have been approached by a number of guys. Well yesterday I felt just like ""fuck it"" and brought this guy home and we fooled around and had sex and stuff, and I feel kinda bad cause I was really awkward but w/e. He didn't seem to think it was too awful since he stuck around for a very long time the day after.

But the thing is that I didn't even enjoy any touching or anything really that much and I didn't really feel excited or pleasure from anything that I guess you're supposed to? Tbh I'd much rather do something like program or play videogames instead. What confuses me is the thought of sex does turn me on and I do get horny, but I just never feel the want to actually have sex or make out with another person.

I've read the FAQ and I'm still not sure about my sexuality.,"Hi everyone,

I've watched videos about asexuality and read the FAQ and some posts in this channel but I am still not sure about who I am regarding that matter. I don't want to define myself using a specific word but it would be nice to know that I am not the only one feeling how I feel, which is the current situation as all my friends are hetero/bi/gay.

- I am in my mid twenties and I have never ejaculated in a girl (with or without condom) despite having slept with girls multiple times. I want to be in love/couple but sex is not the thing I am looking for, being close to someone in terms of intimacy is. The best part when I slept with someone has always been the talk/cuddle part for me, not the physical activity.
- I never had romantic feelings for men, but I look at them as I look at women. I have no shame thinking about a guy ""Wow, he's smart and beautiful, really handsome."".
- I use sex to go further in terms of feelings with someone when this is required, not because I want to do it (i.e. a woman wants to kiss thus I will do it to make her happy and to go further in our relationship, not because I want to satisfy my appetite).
- I cannot masturbate without content (porn/stories), masturbation is a physical activity for me more than a need to be fulfill. I can masturbate twice a week or twice a month, it feels good to do it but it's like watching Netflix in terms of mental investment.

Those are the main things that makes me think that I am not heterosexual, but it does not make me think I am asexual either. I like to cuddle, I love to speak/listen and look at someone in the eyes and feel there is something, I can find people beautiful and attractive. But sex has been a means to an end my entire life and I am just starting to understand that, despite the media and pressure from my surrounding, this is not the ultimate goal I have when meeting the girl of my dreams. Do you think that makes me asexual?

Differentiating between Asexual and Gray-A,"I was just wondering about my place on the ace spectrum again, and thought I'd put my thoughts here instead of AVEN because I've been posting a lot there. I've ID'd as gray-ace for quite a while now, and I wanted to hear thoughts on where I am in the spectrum (I know I am the only one that can properly label myself, I'm just asking for thoughts). So, this is a (hopefully short enough) explanations of my feelings that is pretty much just ripped from one of my post's on AVEN (too lazy to write about the same thing twice, heh).

When I had my first and only crush, all sexual thoughts of her were quite strange to me, and it was purely romantic. I do get aroused and masturbate, even with images, but I personally think that it's probably just the act that I like (and maybe a fetish too, idk). I haven't really ever thought that I want sex with one particular person. I'm not always repulsed by it, but indifferent at most, though I cannot think of people that I know when I do it. That's too weird for me. I do also experience aesthetic attraction, which I thought was sexual attraction for quite a while (in these instances I'd kind of feel a draw to look at someone, but not an urge to do sexual things with them or see them naked or anything like that).

Nympho is pushing over boundaries.,"Heyy, short background: Guy, 17, ace and Lithromantic.

So a few months back (Around October 2017) I met this girl, a sweet and lovely soul. We met via Instagram and we didn’t know that we lived in the same village and thought we were 1000’s if miles apart. When we discovered that we did live in the same place, we decided to meet up. So on Halloween eve I met her. We knew a lot about each other going in, so I thought since I told her I was ace that she knew it wasn’t a date. We had a lovely evening and she gotten a little too touchy for my taste, and when I left I told her that I rather not have her kiss me and she didn’t.

We kept talking the rest of the night in DM, and she said she was sad that I wouldn’t let her kiss me. I told her that I didn’t let her do that because I’m asexual. But that if we were dating (didn’t know I was Lith back then) I would let her kiss me and I would have sex with her. I said that I wouldn’t enjoy having sex, but maybe I enjoy seeing her happy by having sex. She replied with a photo, only a photo.

It was a full nude photo, with text saying “Wanna try? We could be FWB”. I told her that I was not that way, and that she kinda crossed a boundary by sending a nude. At the point she kept trying to get me to sleep with her. She went full nympho. After a few photos I said that I was going to sleep and would rather not speak to her for a few days…

And the next day, 24 hours later then the last convo I gotten another pic, and a day later another, and this went on for 2 weeks (at one point I stopped opening the photos cus it was clear what it was going to be of) before I said that I didn’t want to speak to her again. 

That was in November, and she still occasionally sends me this kind of pics in hope of making me come over. She hopes I will “Become normal and straight!”. 

I told my straight and bi friends about the situation (Didn’t show the pics tho, that’s too douchebaggy) and every time I get the exact same answer “The fucks wrong with you? She’s pretty and she’s nice! Go and fuck her!” Like I’m the crazy one. 

I’m sad about the whole situation, but I’m glad that I’m even more sure that I’m ace than I was before. 

And everyone who isn’t ace but has a boy/girlfriend that’s ace: Sometimes our boundaries are a lot faster reached than with sexual people, so ask before you act. It might ruin a great relationship/friendship.

And one question for aces who are romantic: what do you feel about this sentence? I thought this was going to be how I would live a normal love life: 

“But that if we were dating (didn’t know I was Lith back then) I would let her kiss me and I would have sex with her. I said that I wouldn’t enjoy having sex, but maybe I enjoy seeing her happy by having sex. “

I thought/hoped this was going to happen, so that I would enjoy sex in the sense of enjoying making someone else happy.",Asexual

My asexual friend initiated sex with me,"Hello! 

A few months ago I stared talking to a boy who wasn’t (and probably still isn’t) sure about his sexuality. He’s attracted mostly to women and finds men physically attractive but I’m not sure if that means he’s also sexually attracted to them.

For a while he was pretty hot and cold with me as far as physical interaction went and one day I had sex with him not knowing he could have been asexual. After we had sex he said he felt frozen and I didn’t understand what that meant. A few days later I brought it up and asked him about it and he told me that when people initiate sex with him he feels violated and after hearing that I felt really awful about it. He told me he’s never really been interested in sex or wanted to go out of his way for it and I told him that there’s a possibility that he’s asexual. He shrugged. A few weeks went by and he said “Ever since you told me I might be asexual I’m pretty sure that’s what I am”. So that was established and from then on I didn’t want to do anything more than hugging and the very occasional peck (I’d probably kiss him once a week). His bed was also off-limits to me since I’m sure he thought I was going to try to initiate sex with him. 

Last night I started hugging him while he was sitting on his bed and he didn’t push me away. I didn’t want anything other than to be close to him, and he hugged me back and later got into bed while I was lying down (the bed had been off-limits to me for at least 3-4 months at this point). We started making out and I was very cautious about it, stopping every few moments to make sure I didn’t cross any boundaries. He keep pulling me closer so I took that as a signal that everything was going okay, and then I felt him trying to unbutton my pants so I helped him out which led to him trying to take them off. At this point I took that as a signal he was interested in having sex so I mirrored his actions and tried to unbutton his and he immediately took them off.

We ended up having sex and I thought it was a great step since I know he’s uncomfortable with those sorts of things. I’m a very sexual person myself, but I ultimately decided that sex wasn’t as important to me as keeping him in my life was. 

I can’t help but feel sort of guilty about what happened though. I know I probably should have verbally asked if he was okay with everything, but since he initiated I just assumed he was okay with it. He’s not the type of person who likes to verbally explain things or answer them, either. He once told me instead of saying sorry he’d rather show someone he’s sorry and that he values actions more than words. 

Should I just take it as a good sign that he initiated it? I probably won’t be able to get this close to him for a long time but is it safe to assume that he just wants sex when it’s on his terms? I guess asking him myself would be the better option but as stated above, he doesn’t like to verbally explain things lol... I’m perfectly happy with not having sex until he wants it and it makes me think that he felt safe enough with me to initiate it last night. 

If someone could give me some insight from being asexual or being in a relationship with an asexual it would be greatly appreciated! I’m trying my best to understand what it means to be asexual or gray-sexual so I can let him feel safe around me. I don’t want to pressure him in any way and he’s someone I don’t know if I could stand losing. He’s become a pretty huge part of my life now and I’d like to stay with him if I can! 

Thanks so much in advance!",Asexual

Name calling,"Hey, I’m a guy, 17y/o, ace and lith.

Today I told one of my better friends that I an ace and aro (actually I’m lithromantic, but small steps) and I had to explain what that actually is. Well, because I haven’t said it a lot yet, and I’m not living in a English speaking country, so I had to try and explain it. The jist of what I said was: “I don’t feel attraction towards any gender and are somewhat incapable of falling in love”.

And here it gets good: “So you don’t feel love? Are you a psychopath? Or are you a sociopath? What the hell’s wrong with you?”
So one of my best friends thinks I’m a crazy person. He thought that “I can’t fall in love” means the same thing as “I don’t love people, not even my family and closest friends”

Am I in the right place?,"I’m a 28 year old male.  I am not a virgin, though my only sexual activity was in a one month period 3 years ago. I have a strong desire to be in a relationship, in theory, and have had plenty of serious crushes, dated a bit (except for the last 2 years) and have felt physical attraction towards women. 

However I feel extremely discouraged with my lack of success, prospects, or anything similar and I guess I’ve given up. That’s normal I guess and not unique to asexuality but I guess the question is whether or not the fact that I don’t feel compelled to do anything resembling effort. Another thing that tends to happen is that I can have the opportunity, in theory, but once things start to get closer I either get scared or the attraction wears off. 

Im not sure who to talk to about this stuff and was eve n hesitant to post here for whatever reason. Anyway hope anyone has insight ",Asexual
Attraction?,"Okay, I need to set up some background for this:

I have recently come to the conclusion that I (might be) asexual. I still have a very high libido (I practically read erotic smut everyday - it's my form of fun) but outside of these moments I never really felt sexual attraction to anyone. I don't really want to/care about dating and only have had two crushes that ultimately didn't result in anything. So, according to what little research I've done this would qualify me as a ace. Case closed, right?

This is where my question comes in. 

To go into this, I need to do some set-up. First, you should know that I have Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis. This results in multiple symptoms that I won't get into, but primarily it means I have trouble walking. Secondly, I have been going to Physical Therapy (PT) for the last couple weeks as a result of this. For those who don't know PT consists of a trainer doing exercises to a patient to help stretch out their limbs. It's their *job* to help patients and, in my case, help steady them as they stretch. A hand on my back or hips - that's all it is. 

But I'm still hypersensitive to it and it's not only physical. I've legitimately enjoyed the few interactions I had with her and though we've only met a handful of times I can't help thinking about her (as can be seen in this reddit post). So, I guess it raises the question of whether I'm feeling attraction to her. There's also the fact that I was raised in a devout Catholic household and went to a private Christian school. In it, I remember this one teacher stating that students should not date till college because the relationships would be fleeting. I latched on to that, but once I went to college I still did not pursue anyone. 

I guess to wrap this up, I want to ask you all - is this (sexual) attraction. And if so, am I really asexual?",Asexual
There's something in me I can't understand,"Hi, thanks for reading this. I'm a 23 year old male, and I think it's important to mention I suffer from social anxiety, though I've been going to therapy for the last 18 months and I've almost turned into another (much much better) person. Like, my lifestyle changed a LOT, and in part that means I started interacting more with women. It's not an easy task for me to ask someone out but it's something I'm able to do now. I'm a virgin (I mean, I had no social life since 16 until I started therapy), but I felt things for many women in my life. A few months ago I even found myself rejecting a girl who had a big crush on me but although she was nice I didn't see her as a potential partner in a relationship. 
 So, having set the context, let's get straight to the point. After all this time since my life changed and started interacting more with the opposite sex I realized that I can fall in love, feel things towards a woman, but I don't really wish to have sex. The thing that is hard for me to understand is that for example I masturbate as any regular person (2 or 3 times a week), meaning that my sexual needs are there, but the idea of having actual sex with another person kind of disgusts me. I find the whole thing kind of disgusting. The idea of penetrating a vagina makes me feel a bit disgusted, I don't even like their looks (by the way, I'm not gay or anything, never felt any kind of attraction towards men). I did kiss girls and that's okay to me, but the whole sex thing makes me step back. 
 Well, that's it. I hope any of you can shed some light over this and give another perspective. Thanks for reading up to this point :)

TL;DR: I have sexual desire as any regular guy but the idea of having actual sex with another person makes me feel kind of disgusted.",Asexual
Do people actually want/desire sex that much?,Don't people go the first 10 to 15 years of their life NOT having sex and they never think about it or desire. So why is it different after that age? I would think it would be very common for people to continue not wanting sex after adolescence. Do most people suddenly get turned on by other people's bodies after a certain age? ,Asexual
Am I asexual?,"I'm 25 and I'm a virgin.  I am not turned on by naked men or women at all. 

I do have fetishes... I'm not going to say what it is but an example would be like people wearing socks. And that always turns me on but it doesn't matter if its a man or a woman. 

I look at pictures of my fetish online and masturbate almost daily, sometimes several times a day. 

I've had plenty of romantic crushes but never any sexual attraction. I've had crushes on female teachers, teenage females when I was a pre-teen, and many different guys.  

I secretly wish I could marry my best female friend because she's my best friend and we just get along so well. I love and care about her. We have a close bond. I have zero sexual attraction to her but if I had to pick to marry someone, she is my first choice. 

But she is straight and we live in a predominately heterosexual world. I date men and I'm fine with that. I want to marry a guy I love and who loves me back but we never kiss or hold hands and never have sex.  So far every guy wants sex and I do some sexual acts to satisfy them. 

Using my fetish, I can be turned on by almost anyone regardless of gender or appearance. Twice I got physically turned on by hugging a very fit guy wearing clothes. Seeing naked people does nothing for me. Porn does nothing for me. 

But then again, I do have a preference to date guys romantically. I have fantasies of acting out my fetish with them. I've had fantasies of them doing mutual masturbation on me in response to my fetish. 

 Even if I am asexual, I am going to continue living my life identifying as a heterosexual women (because societal pressure). I am just going to think about my fetish or have the guy act out my fetish to make me horny and maybe I'll want sex. ",Asexual
Can I be attracted to someone and still not want to have sex with them?,"OK, so I've identified as asexual since I found out its existence in college (~3 years now).  I tried some dating just to make sure that that was something that I really didn't want to do, and at the time that's what it felt like (but maybe it was just the couple of guys that I dated that made me feel like I didn't want to date).  Then within the past year I started noticing that I would feel different kinds of attraction (physical, romantic, sexual..) towards people that I had developed an emotional connection with.  So I thought perhaps I am demisexual.  Now I'm pretty confused because I have this weird relationship with a friend/roommate who I am pretty emotionally close to and we are both snuggly people so we've kind of gotten into this habit of cuddling every night before bed.  And when we do this or I even think about doing this with him, my body gets excited and I experience some sexual reactions. Sometimes when we cuddle I get the urge to kiss him, but I also feel repulsed at the thought of kissing him at the same time.  When he falls asleep I sometimes kiss his head a few times and I feel like it would be really easy to move down closer to his lips, but I don't want to touch his lips. Now I'm wondering what is this and where the heck did this sexual energy come from and what does it mean because I feel like I might be attracted to him but I also have zero desire to have sex with him. It's almost like I want to be as romantically intimate as possible without being sexual.  So what do you call that? Is that still demi?? Is that even a thing???",Asexual

[x Post r/aromantic] Advice please,"Heya! As most of you guys, I too struggle to really understand myself and would like to have some insight and/or just write my thoughts down to maybe make some sense of it all.

Maybe I should start chronological. I was always a tomboy, and when I was like 12 and found shonen ai manga (boy's love) I remember that in our shonen AI online community we liked to joke around that we are just 'gay guys born in a girl's body'. For a while I really liked that description, and for a while I was really convinced I was transgender. As my best friend outed himself as gay one, two years later, I really put an effort into being supportive. Went to him to gay youth meetings, started a LGBT+ society at school, went onto parades etc. Etc. Etc. I got to know a lot of gay, Lesbian, trans kids. (In German we have a term called 'Gabi' - a straight woman taking 'motherly' care of gay guys, and that was my nickname for years.) During this time I realised quite quickly that there is no chance i'm transgender. Not stereotypically feminine at all, really into gay porn, but surprise, that doesn't make you a trans guy if you don't have any desire to actually be a guy and neither have a desire to date a guy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Still. Considering that all my friends were able to identify as something, I kinda really liked the idea to identify myself with something too. I distinctly remember looking through a glossary online and just wanting to identify as something. I picked asexual at that point, and I'm no longer sure if I did it to be 'cool' and have a fancy term as well, if I picked it because my self confidence was so low that the idea of not ever having to find a partner was reassuring ('because nobody would want me anyway'), or because I really thought I was ace.

But I had a few crushes since then. Older men (two teachers when I was like 15 and 17, one professor when I was 19), and no, my relationship to my dad is great, haha. Not surprisingly, none of those married, 35-50 year old dudes ever even knew about my infatuation with them. I liked a guy my age when I was 20, but he wasn't interested and the moment I knew the crush kinda just poofed away.

In none of these cases I really entertained the idea of Fucking or kissing them. I remember really wanting to smell my first teacher crush cause he always smelled like coffee, lol, and I liked the idea of cuddling. On a couch while watching a movie, not full body cuddling kinda deal?

My sex drive has been really high the moment I moved out of university, had my own room and finally tried masturbating for the first time. When I wank though, I do it to erotica/fetish stuff, not ideas of specific people.

I had a few guys asking me out, and according to my friends it was very obvious they were flirting but I never noticed it. Whoops. I always turned them down, once because I kinda chickened out of the idea for being anything but friends, the times after because I felt it was unfair to date someone who I am not into.

For at least the last few years I really wanted to experience kissing (and sleeping with) somebody. I thought I couldn't crave it because I never experienced it?? I like the idea of dating, but I feel that is only true because the SOs of my best friends are like... All they care about and I like the idea of having a best friend who is socially expected to care about me the most, lol.

I am generally attracted to men. I think my bar is kinda low as well, haha. When I talk to my friends, I like how people look often a lot sooner than them. I hardly know anyone in my friend group that I wouldn't say 'Id tap that' to, including girls and non-defining people. Once someone isn't a stranger anymore I could imagine 'being' with them - and my sex drive goes up when they do anything hot.

The idea of being 'forever alone' is as soothing as depressing. I don't want children, I am happy around myself and I think I'm too egoistical in some aspects to really want to bother with compromising with a different person. On the other hand... I enjoy the company of my friends, I love having Flatmates and dying alone with twenty dogs is kinda sad.

NOW the reason that really made me question myself and made me start digging through resources again:

I was backpacking through Taiwan this week with two friends. In our hostel, we met this guy. He was a bit weird (Id assume high functioning autism but that's from someone who is only majoring psychology next term, haha), but I instantly thought he was cute. My friends thought he was being a bit flirty (but in a creepy way), but I didn't mind/didnt notice him flirting etc.

Stuff went on, we talked a bit, the next night we all were in the common room and he sat down next to me so I could show him a video game etc. I noticed for the first time he got flirty cause he kinda started inviting me to touch him I guess (He claimed he could beat me in arm wrestling, he jumped up in surprise during the video game and invited me to see how hard his heart was beating etc. Etc.) And I kinda... Didn't mind?

People left, we kept sitting and playing and talking and it got two am and everyone was upstairs and he asked me if he could kiss me. And... I guess I just sensed my opportunity? Cute guy, a little older and my type, nobody would know, I could kiss someone for the first time, there is literally no way I'll ever see him again... No strings attached. I said I've never kissed anyone but yes, if he didn't mind that, we leaned forward and -- I kinda felt sick.

I didn't know what I was doing, it kinda weirded me out to feel his lips and his teeth on mine, it wasn't as warm as I imagined to be and it just didn't do anything for me. I broke the kiss, said I'm not into it, apologised and went to bed.

The next day I still felt sick. I know that is probably more related to all the spicey food here, but I couldn't stop thinking that it was cause of the kiss. I really, really, really wasn't into it at all.

And now I have no desire to kiss anyone ever again. I know it could have just been because he is a bad kisser or whatever, and a sample size of one is kinda bad, but I just... Dunno.

I guess at least my friends were happy that the guy didn't hang out with us the night after? °

But... That didn't mean that I don't think the guy was attractive or anything. I think stuff could have gone very differently too if he would have waited with asking or something. I'm just... Not sure. And I'd really like to be.

Any advice? Any recommendations? Any comments? I low key feel I should just kiss some more people to know it was ~me~ not being into it and not ~him~ being a bad kisser? But I wouldn't even know where I could find people who are up to snog, haha. Thank you.

Just came out to one of my best friends!,"Last year, one of my friends guessed that I'm ace and straight-up asked me, but she's been the only one of our friend group with whom I've actually spoken about it. Tonight, another one of my friends and were getting dinner together when the topic of another one of our friends--who believes that only straight, gay, and bi are valid sexualities, annoyingly--came up. I said to my friend, ""Is it really that hard to figure out that I'm ace? I mean, [first friend] figured it out almost as soon as I met her."" She looked slightly startled but said that no, she had figured that I was ace, but had never said anything because she knew I would bring it up if I cared enough. Well, tonight, I guess I did. 

I know it's not as big a deal as coming out to some, since I am very obviously ace (at least in my mind and to at least those two of my friends), but still. This is the first time I've ever been the one to bring it up, so it feels good. I don't know how/if I'll end up coming out to our friend who doesn't think asexuality is a thing, but at least this is a step in the right direction!",Asexual
Sexual gay guy dating asexual gay guy... Need help... Bad...,"I posted this as a comment so I'm going to copy and paste a bit of it... (In case it sounds familiar) 

---

Hey, very sexual guy here with an ace boyfriend. He is amazing and I fell in love with him crazy hard, only been going out for about 5 months but we are basically living together already haha 

I am poly but we haven't discussed the boundaries yet so I haven't went looking for anything else... And honestly I don't know if I want to. I'm so insanely attracted to him, more than anyone I've ever been with... But no sex yet. We haven't even made out, it's always just small pecks. 

The worst part is, when I started dating him, he would talk about how he used to be crazy sexual, several times a day, any moving thing. When he finally felt safe enough with me to come out, I couldn't react badly, I love him so much... It was just jarring to go from one extreme to the other... Had to change my whole future image and expectations...

So here we are 5 months later, I'm laying in bed in my underwear (used to sleep nude, so that has been a transition) and he let's me rub his body and I can even touch his genitals but he never gets hard or anything... And when he does (mostly in the morning) he turns away... I feel so rejected. 

Idk, he keeps saying ""it'll take time..."" And he has explained that his asexuality is due to an injury 2 years ago... But I've asked if it's a mental thing, from his accident but he swears up and down it's not. He says something was damaged inside him and needs time to heal. 

It'd be one thing if he was always going to be asexual, I could work with that (it'd be hard though cuz he is 150% my type) but he keeps giving me hope... I want to cry at how sexually frustrated I am.

I'm allowed to masturbate in the same bed but he is almost always is turned away or asleep... I offer for him to join in, in whatever capacity he wants... But nothing... 

Anyways... I suppose we are still working things out... As the sexual person who is trying so so so hard to not pressure or make him uncomfortable, I want to cry... It feels like sexual rejection and I'm not normally a hyper sexual person but I am around him and it hurts even more...

I honestly am considering a therapist for this... I want him to be comfortable and he is the love of my life but I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle all this frustration and feelings of rejection... 

I've read some books on asexuality and am trying hard to understand... I just don't know... 

Any advice? I'm really trying... 

Also, sorry if any typos, I'm crying in bed while I type this...

TL;DR: highly sexual person super sexually frustrated and feeling rejected but trying hard to be supportive with ace boyfriend who I'm madly in love with. Considering therapy to deal with how I'm feeling...

- Danced with him/herself

So a few hours back I was talking to my mother. And I don’t really know how but the topic of sexuality came on the table. Then I told her I wasn’t straight or gay, but ace. After explaining what that means, she said she always knew that I wasn’t straight (I have to admit, that hurt a little) and that she accepts me for who I am. I’m really glad she took it this way. I said that if she wanted to know anything she just needed to ask. She asked me 1 question, one that hurt her what made her sad… “Will I ever become a grandmother?” Than I told her the truth “I think you will, I’m not sexually attracted to any gender but am heteroromantic. So if I get a girlfriend and it’s time I thing we will try. It’s not pleasant for a woman to give birth, so I would make my sacrifice.”

I’m still not in a place where I can openly talk about this among friends yet the 2 or 3 close ones I have confided in have been nothing but supportive (one even basically came out and said they already knew,) and since talking to them, I feel happier in myself, happier at work, and more importantly, happier as a person.

[Survey] Needing participants for this IRB-approved survey - especially ACE and other sexual minorities!,"Hi everyone, As you can see, I've been a redditor for several years, so this is a legit ask from a real queer person doing sociolinguistic research. I also have IRB approval for this survey (informed consent form in survey link).

Warning: this is for adults (18+) only, and the content may cause discomfort. This survey will ask you to provide terms for ""penis"" and ""vagina"". All terms you can think of.

In the previous (forthcoming) paper, we were looking at how the terms can be categorized metaphorically, and what that may mean for societal views that I don't want to expand upon so it doesn't spoil your responses! We may have found something interesting in the data related to sexual orientation, so this is where y'all come in! 

We had over 400 respondents last time, and a decent chunk were non-hetero. But we need more to analyze the data we're looking at, *especially* asexual folks and others in the smaller ""sectors"" of the LGBT+ family. Note: I'm still using the old data in this new paper, so if for some reason you have already taken this survey (thank you!) please do not take it again. Thanks so much for your time, and please let me know if I need to adjust this post to follow any rules I may have missed.

Any aromantics here?,I'm 99% sure I'm aromantic. There's various reasons why I won't have a relationship but it doesn't bother me at all.

I think I might be asexual,"Since the age of 12.5 I have been identifying as gay. But now I'm starting to question that. I'm now 14 and have a boyfriend. I have had a few sexual experiences with him before (blowjobs, fingering, etc.) and I enjoyed them for the most part. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable doing it, other times I really want to. It's the same with sexual feelings for people. Sometimes I want to have sex with my boyfriends right then and there, other times I just want to be romantic or sometimes not even be around him at all. I consider myself to be quite anti-social too. I do masturbate, excessively... but I normally only think about random things. Like my YouTube channel, a video or movie that I saw recently, or events that are coming up. I enjoy looking at some furry porn (or ""yiff"" as it's called) but mostly I don't find myself jerking off to it. I normally just admire it for the cute art style. My boyfriend and I talk a lot over Discord, I normally start off trying to be romantic but he'll turn it sexual. However sometimes I'll find myself making it sexual. Basically everything changes based on my mood, which also changes quite a bit.

"Asexual More Than Lesbian, and How to Find Ace Partners?","Hey people, I've got a question. Or a few. Sorry if this is long.

I never thought about my sexuality until a year ago. (I'm in my early 20s by the way.) I literally never thought about it. I assumed I was straight. I have never dated, and never had a desire to. Then my therapist asked me if I was sexually attracted to a guy I sort of had a crush on. I asked, ""What do you mean by sexual attraction?""

In short, I wasn't attracted to him like that. I wasn't even willing to put in the time to date him (I had better things to do). But that set me on a year's worth of research. Recently I've been thinking I'm lesbian, because I find the female body really lovely and I would love to touch one and have a life partner who is a woman like myself. Frankly I would like to date a woman (that seems more interesting than dating a man). But, I don't get turned on by woman either (although I've never dated so I'm not sure).

I keep coming back to asexuality.

My main question is: how in the world do I find a friend/girlfriend in my area who is asexual (or is willing to live without sex)? It's hard enough to find asexual people. I would love to have a life commitment with someone who is a best friend and romantic partner--go out to dinner, dance, cuddle, sleep together, maybe kiss, share finances, etc. But how do I find people like this?

Also, has anyone ever tried to find a partner in the lesbian community? I'm a bit afraid to go there because it's so sex-obsessed, but I love androgynous and soft butch girls and...you never know.

Is it possible to tend towards asexuality out of hate for your appearance?,"?

So to start off, I'm in my teens.

I don't really care about sex tbh, I'm more or less asexual and do not have the want nor desire for sexual activity (especially anal/vaginal sex!) with the opposite sex although I do feel vague physical attraction to them sometimes, I don't think I have the emotional capacity (I'm not trying to sound edgy, I literally don't think that I have those feelings) for romance because it doesn't seem any different than friendship or basic tolerance of another individual to me. I don't feel attracted to any form of sex besides maybe handjobs and oral but that's it.


But despite not really caring about relationships or even friends I still find myself obsessed over how ugly I look, anyone know why this could be? Seems most people hate their appearance in the context of them thinking that it won't help land them a date or make them socially popular, while that's true I don't think I care about that.

Is the common definition of asexuality restrictive? (And possibly ahistorical),"I haven't seen discussion about this topic that much on this subreddit, so I felt the need to bring it up, especially since I've noticed this subreddit also uses this definition quite often: ""lacks sexual attraction"".

https://theacetheist.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/history-of-asexual-definitions-a-summary/ I'm going to link this article I found here because it better words the heart of what I'm getting to, I'd recommend reading that or at least skimming it before commenting.

Basically: there is a lot of evidence to suggest that asexuality used to have a broader meaning and only due to wanting to have an easy way to explain asexuality to non-aces did we settle on the definition of ""lacks sexual attraction"", and after reading some evidence I've found around the internet, I'm quite convinced that the way that we talk about asexuality may be somewhat restrictive or ahistorical, but not only that, I worry that using this definition may impact the way that we talk to people who are questioning if they are or aren't asexual, when often, if someone is confused, giving them this definition seems to be our advice.

Now I love physical affection, like kissing, hugging, making out, etc... But having sex with someone just kinda isn't appealing to me, is it possible to be asexual while still getting sexual feelings towards people? Or is it just that I'm not all that find of sex and it doesn't need a label? ",Asexual

My biggest fear is being alone forever,"(I apologize if you just saw a post from me. I wrote it upon waking up and wasn't happy with my jumbling thoughts so I'm redoing it. So Sorry.)

I'm new to this community but I'm so glad I found it. Just reading the FAQ answered so many questions that I had and confirmed my suspicions that I'm asexual - with a libido! So thank you very much for that.

I thought I would try reaching out, to see if there's anyone else that shares this fear. Being alone.

I don't mean being alone for periods of time. I've been single for years. My biggest fear is never finding anyone to settle down with. I don't want to get married but I would love to find a platonic/romantic relationship with someone that doesn't involve sex at all. It seems like this is impossible, especially because I live in a small city.

I've had relationships before but they didn't work out, obviously. I was with a man for 5 years and struggled throughout. He was a very sexual person and we engaged often - mostly to me just lying there hating every second of it. My second relationship was with a woman that was gender-confused and slightly asexual? I don't know if she ever figured it out. She very quickly became my best friend and I would have married her in a heartbeat. We were together for 4 years and it was amazing. But we couldn't work the distance out (she was in Texas, I am in Canada). Losing her was a huge blow and I've been alone since then. She was my only friend and now I have nobody. Not one single friend and I'm very alone.

I don't feel much hope for myself. I hope in the future I can meet someone, but how is it done? I've gone on a few dates since then, with men. They were all interested in one thing and it was very uncomfortable for me. I have no idea how to broach the subject. Is it something you put in an online profile and hope somebody comes across it? Is it something you bring up on the first date? I feel like being upfront about it is better, rather than face rejection?

So many questions... I hope lurking around here, I can start to get some answers. I'm so glad this community exists. Thank you for being here. &lt;3

"If someone doesn't like their sexuality, how does one become asexual?","I don't want to give too much information and background and bog this down with wordiness and nonsense. 

I just want to say that I really don't want to come off as rude, disrespectful, or anything. I've just been feeling that being asexual (and possibly aromantic) suits me more and I don't understand how I can't be asexual. 

If someone were to change and become asexual (not celibate, asexual - no desire in sex or even romantic love) how do you think this could be possible?

Questioning my asexuality after years of being convinced I’m ace?,"Hey all. I’ve been an active lurker-slash-sometimes poster on this sub for years, and this is definitely the last post I thought I would ever make. I’m not sure I’m asexual anymore. 

I’ve never had sex before but I’m starting to think I want to. I used to not understand what sexual attraction was, merely seeing aesthetic beauty. Now I understand what people mean when they call others “hot.”

After identifying strongly as asexual for years, I’m really distraught by this. Was my asexuality a lie? Maybe I still am ace, but merely gray? I’m only 19, could I even be a “really late bloomer”? I wish I could just figure it all out and get rid of this doubt.

Do I have to come out / does letting someone know that im ace matter?,So i have a best friend and like best friends do we talk about crushes. Or more talk about his crushes because I’m ace and Demi romantic.

Pleasantly surprised at how active asexuality.org is,"Seriously, the forum is booming over there.

Thanks for the upvotes a few of you, but could I please have some comments....

I'm baring all, as it were, here. I'd appreciate any opinions or whatever, please. Also it's really long, sorry.

**Background:**

Hi, I'm a 22 year old, lesbian ^(1) , trans woman (she,hers,her) and have always thought I must be Ace, I've never experienced sexual attraction towards anyone.

^(1= sorta, I'm more panromantic, but I rarely feel any attraction to anyone but women or enbies.)

I do experience romantic attraction, and it tends to hit me very hard.

I've only had one relationship ever, and that was when I was ~13/14 (yeah, yeah). I'm a virgin, kinda obvious, and while I'm not completely naive, my sex education has only been cishet piv, and I'm kinda out of touch with what people do else wise.

I experience genital dysphoria, even thinking about a partner one day just *seeing* my bits (I can't even name them) gives me an anxiety attack. I find kissing too much, however I'm okay with hugging, and chest play (weird?). I masturbate though (never looking at myself), but it's more because I like the feeling and stress relief rather than anything sexual.

I'm not ready for a relationship right now even though I want one; I'm sorting out my life with jobs, name stuff, family stuff, transition, etc. at the moment.

**The crisis unfolds:**

About a week ago I met a new friend (also trans, similar age) online, and we've been talking almost all day everyday since then. I fell for her and her me (though not as hard), but we both agreed that neither of us was ready for a relationship. We've got a lot of shit to deal with first. She is definitely *not* ace. We flirt a lot, but that's it, apparently I'm really flirty, something I didn't realise until recently.

Yesterday she met someone, she told me that she'd met them, but not said any more. Previously I hadn't minded if she talked about her sexuality or anything.

Apparently last night they did *something* together ^(2) , because she texted me to say she came (sorta ""eww"", but before I wouldn't have cared). And told me that she *really* enjoyed it, I'm sorta happy about this, she's been needing this for a while (it's kind of obvious from everything we've spoken about).

^(2= apparently it was just online stuff, that's got me curious, just because I don't know what that could mean, especially when *she* said that, but I'm not going to intrude.)

**Crisis time:**

The odd thing is I feel jealous. Not just of my friend but also of the person she met. I know it isn't anything romantic between them, it's just sex. ^(3) But I'm sort of jealous of my friend's new friend, because she has my friend's attention in a way I can't have and that she's enjoying something I can't (friend's friend is also trans, doesn't have genital dysphoria, actually this is an assumption). And, I'm jealous of my friend because she can enjoy herself in a way I can't even if I wanted to (because dysphoria). Plus, you know, romantic feelings and everything messing my mind up, even though I know we aren't compatible, or ready.

^(3= long story, trust me here)

I'm feeling weird now, do these feelings mean I'm not ace, have I been wrong since forever? What does this mean when it comes to the relationship between me and my friend? Is it okay to be jealous here, or am I being completely selfish? I'm really struggling to work through these feelings, I'm not very emotionally inclined.

Sometimes I wonder what the deal really is with me,"I look at men all the time and think ""wow, so attractive"" or I speak to kind men and my heart starts pounding. The idea of a wonderful husband, partner in crime, someone to share my life with, to love and be loved is som3thing I crave so much.

To the point where last week I bumped into an old friend I always had a mini crush on as a teenager, and my heart skipped a beat. Suddenly I'm imagining one day being with him with our children, happy. I long for men to ask me out or to look at me ""that way"", to fall in love with me.

But I can't. I can't even let myself entertain the idea of one date. I had a dream the other night where I was being served at a cafe by a guy I found really attractive. I was wishing that he would ask me out. Then he came over and gave me his number and I went into lockdown. Panic. I can't. I'll hurt him, I'll frustrate him. I'll make him love me and never give him what he wants or needs and trap him. I will destroy him. But I'll upset him too if I don't text him. He'll think I don't like him when I do. His confidence broken.

This was a dream. Not real at all.

Thing is. I can't have sex. I just can't. I wish I could so I could just be normal and have a chance of maybe making someone happy. But I tense up, my anxiety sky rockets. I feel sick and clammy and guilty. So much guilt. And shame. ""I'm a bad person. I shouldn't be doing this. It's wrong"". When I know it's perfectly natural! But I cat get past it. Even hand stuff makes me feel disgusting. I get no pleasure from it. I hate it. I have only ever done It out of duty. And felt dirty and wrong and bad afterwards.

I've had one ""proper relationship"" (if you can really call it proper). Together from the ages 16-19. Head over heels. He pressured and pushed me a lot and could be quite forceful at times which caused tension and arguments but it's understandable when your girlfriend won't put out!! I messed him up so badly. He loved me ad I don't understand why (he must have done seeing as he stayed so long). I felt like I'd manipulated and trapped him. Eventually we gave up. He had become depressed and I was an anxious mess. 

It's been 4 years and he is happy now. I put my problems down to age ad being pretty significantly underweight due to a eating disorder. 

I've tried dating again twice since then. One of whom I felt could have been my soul mate. Everything was perfect. But when it came to making it official (furthest we'd gone was kissing and dates), I freaked because I knew what came next. So I ran. Left him in the lurch with barely an explanation. The o her I cared about so deeply, yet again, the intimacy was just too much to bear thinking about.

I had hoped I'd have grown out of it (mentally and physically by being a pretty much healthy weight and older) which was why I allowed myself to try again but nothing changed and I feel it never will. I can't give a man what he wants or needs (I cat even do what it takes to have my own wishes of having children granted) and I can't allow myself to keep hurting people by testing my readiness on them.

Girls always complain about guys being dicks. They're not. There are so many incredible men out there and I refuse to mess up another one.

I just wish I could get over it and be normal and maybe have a chance of being with someone. But I need to stop thinking about it because it's just not going to happen.

Sometimes I feel broken,"I'm not always sex repulsed. The IDEA of sex - especially more kinky sex - is very appealing to me. But then, when I meet someone who I think is attractive, I feel like crawling into my shell like a turtle any time sex is even IMPLIED. 

I consider myself to be demi, maybe grey ace. I want and think about having a sexual relationship with people I am close to and who I am in romantic relationships with, and I wish I could do it... but I just can't. Not until I've been with the person so long that they usually give up on me.

Idk, just rambling I guess. I'm having one of those nights. I wish I could just be sexually aroused whenever the people who are interested in me wanted, but I can't, and I'm so lonely because of it.",Asexual

Advice when Asexuality is caused by a neurological disorder.,"Hey, not implying that asexually is a disease, but in my case, I think it was brought about by my multiple sclerosis, I've been married for 13 years, and have not had sex with my wife for maybe two or three years.  M.S.causes your white blood cells to attack your brain, causing lessions to form.  Since they can form anywhere, the symptoms can be quite varied.  I love my wife, but don't feel it's fair for her to never have sex with a human again.  We are broke as hell from the crime of having major medical problems in the USA, if we can ever crawl out of it, I'll definitely insist we get some marital counciling, but any advice for right now? I sleep/rest 16+ hours a day from the fatigue that goes along with the m.s. my brain gets exhausted just listening to background noise from being in the big city.  We moved here so my wife could be close to her family, for her to have more human interaction.  I used to be such a chill guy, but now I get so irate, when there is anything but almost complete silence, I just have dreams/nightmares that I will end up living as a hermit out in our cabin in the dessert.  (We aren't wealthy, it was one of those buy acres for a few hundred bucks an acre on the internet deals, because it's in the middle of nowhere, and I built a tiny house on it with construction supplies I dumpster dived in the big city before I got sick)

Have no idea what to do.  Part of me feels Hermitage is the only solution, I can still be entertaining at parties, but it's like I'm playing a role.  I get no joy from it.  part of me is terrified, part of me feels like I've let down my partner by the symptoms of my disease, irrationally, even though I was really helpful/supportive through her two cancer diagnosis.

A bit of a problem. Am I ace? Or something else?,"Here goes...

I currently identify as bisexual. I have only been sexually involved with 1 woman, (we dated for 4 months) and I've had hardly any sexual or romantic contact with men other than a few dates, and a guy crawling on top of me drunk at a party asking for sex ( that was swell ). 

On to the issue:

I can watch porn, and get turned on. I can have sexual thoughts and be able to have a physical and mental reaction if you catch my drift. But when it comes to the actual act of having sex, I am disinterested once I'm physically present and doing it. There is no emotion, there is no physical pleasure. I'm just going through the motions. I've tried to have hookups just to experiment and the thought of just haveing sex with someone I don't know is so uninteresting and pointless I'd rather sit in a puddle than hook up with someone. 

I have often had thoughts that I could be in a relationship without sex at all. It agitates me how nearly every popular song revolves around sex or hook up culture. 

My question is, does this mean I fall on the ace spectrum? Can I be ace if I like the idea of sex, but not the act itself? Perhaps my fantasies are so ""perfect"" I can't replicate it in reality?

Thanks for your thoughts. If this post is offensive or makes anyone uncomfortable I'll delete it straight away.",Asexual

Am i aromantic?,So I basically feel no desire for a relationship. I used to but I got hurt in the past and haven't been bothered since. I'd feel kind of hopeless finding anyone anyway because I've often chickened out of dates with online girls. I don't really know if I've just given up because I feel so hopeless that my mind has given up. I don't really form crushes anymore. Never wanted to be around certain women more. I don't feel attracted to the prettiest girls like most people. If anything I would go for someone a little more in my league. But I don't even have a sex drive now due to antidepressants I took. So I feel like a relationship is definitely off the cards and will likely never be. But the thought doesn't scare me. I think a relationship would feel really unnatural to me. I couldn't ever be lovey dovey with anyone. If I did get a girlfriend I would treat them as a friend with maybe some sexual benefits if I felt up to it. But I wouldn't have any strong feelings for them. I generally don't have a lot of emotion though I don't laugh a lot or cry at anything. I am potentially autistic so that could be why,Asexual

Need advice.,"Hey everyone, just a heads up, I talk a lot about sex in this post so if this is a triggering subject for you, you might want to skip this one. 
———

Sorry if this doesn’t fit here. I was going to post this on /r/deadbedrooms but then I thought this place might be able to help me. 

I’m a bisexual girl. My boyfriend and I have been in a happy relationship for almost 4 years now. He says he always considered himself to be asexual until he met me. The problem is, we have been having less and less sex. Nowadays we sometimes go a month or even more without it. The weird thing is he always says how much he misses it, but he never initiates it. 

His sexuality was always something he struggled with; actually, at first I was worried he was forcing himself to have sex with me, but he told me many times, and still does, that he truly wants sex to be a part of our relationship. But if I don’t initiate, nothing happens. The issue is, this situation is messing with my self esteem. I suffer from depression and anxiety and the longer we go without sex, the more I feel like it’s my fault, that he doesn’t really like my body or that he isn’t really interested in sex at all - which makes me a monster for expecting him to initiate sex. 

I tried talking to him about it. I asked him if he stills considers himself to be an asexual person, but he said he doesn’t know. He certainly feels sexual desire towards me (his words), but not for anyone else. Then I asked him, if that’s the case, if he could try a little harder to initiate sex once in a while. Then he started crying. 

From what I understand, he still feels very ashamed of his own desires. He said there have been lots of instances when he was really in the mood, but felt like he just couldn’t tell me.  He says he doesn’t understand his feelings apart from being sure he wants to be with me. 

Idk. I’m not even sure what I expect people to reply, tbh. Has anyone been in my BFs position? How can I help him? I love him so much and I hate to see him cry.

Confusing feelings,"Hey guys and girls,

I identify as asexual and have for a few (around 3 or 4) months and have since started a new relationship. I’m confused by a few things and just wanted some advice/opinions on them.

We have a physical relationship because I know it’s important to her. This is the first time in over ten years (possibly longer) I’ve actually enjoyed it. If she told me tonight it wouldn’t happen again, I’d be okay with it but I do enjoy it and don’t feel as hesitant about it as I did.

Also, I was thinking about how I’m doing really well at the moment and how happy I am after a rough few years. It led me to thinking about how I’d react if this relationship ended (ever the optimist). I realised I’d be okay and eventually try finding a girl via ACEapp or one of the asexual dating sites. And then I realised, naturally, that I’d want to find someone I would find beautiful/attractive but that didn’t want to do anything past kissing/making out. With the current enjoyment and looking at people as beautiful, this still means I can identify as asexual, doesn’t it? Because I just don’t actually have the desire to do anything sexual (past said kissing/making out).

If this means I’m identifying wrong, could anyone possibly point me towards somewhere I could learn more about this?",Asexual
I'm not sure if I'm asexual...,"I'm a 23 year old male.  I was very interested in girls until I was 17-18, then my sexual/romantic interests changed to men exclusively.  I didn't have sex until 23 (several months ago).  I was happy identifying as gay because I really enjoyed porn.

My first experience was disappointing.  The guy told me I would be so sensitive I'd just lose it after a few minutes.  He did his thing.  I could hardly feel any sensation - nothing compared to when I masturbate on my own.  He was already close and I was far from it.  He didn't finish and made me feel pretty bad for not finishing.  I think his self image was pretty tied up in other guys finding him attractive, but that is his deal.  I left that encounter feeling worse than ever.

I hooked up with three more guys, all over the course of a month or two.  They all enjoyed our time together (as did I) and they finished, but I didn't.  It got to the point where, the third guy, I just told him upfront that I wasn't going to get off, but I wanted to try and mess around all the same.  At this point, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't an issue of the guy I was with not being right, or whatever.  I wanted to really ""get my feet wet"" before I was comfortable with my understanding of my own sexuality.

So, I tried sex, I didn't enjoy it, and now I really have no desire to pursue doing it again.  In my mind I'm into other guys, but when it comes to having a guy in my bed or whatever, I'm just not into it.  Sex isn't repulsive to me, but I don't enjoy it.  I don't like kissing (at all).  Guys seem to expect me to be able to accurately interpret their gestures when they're trying to make a move or whatever, and I find it very confusing and frustrating (because when I ask ""do you want me to kiss you?"" I'm told I'm killing the mood.  Ugh.)

I don't look at porn anymore.  I have never dated, and have no plans to start.  I don't seek out sex, and the once or twice a guy has chatted me up and asked if I'd be down, I have declined.  It's not because I don't want to necessarily, but I know it won't work out and it'll be a disappointing experience for him.  I experience arousal, but it's followed with a rush of feeling deeply disappointed and I choose not to dwell on those thoughts.  I do masturbate (~once per week), but only because if I go too long without it I have a pretty bad headache and stomach ache.

I've had tests done to see if my testosterone is low or something else, and everything comes back normal.  My doc can't find a chemical reason for this.  I've also been seeing therapist for years and we cannot come up with any psychological reason I could experience this.  

I don't know if I'm asexual.  However, the term ""asexual"" accurately articulates a lot of my sexual identity.  I struggle because, before actually having sex, being gay was something I was open about when it was appropriate.  It's strange not to think of myself as a gay man.

I'm wondering if my experiences are typical of people who identify as asexual.

Thanks!  :)",Asexual

"With all of these threads involving people who wants to become asexual, I must say something here","Before I say something, I must mention my basic background: 

I am 24 years old man, and I have been asexual for over 8 years, but I was not always asexual. How do I know this? 

--------
I knew what was my sexuality was going to be just from a very young age, I was 8 years old, and I was looking at an art book, and I have came across ""Nymphs and Satyr by William-Adolphe Bouguereau"", and I was looking at the women admiring their figure and adoring it. I also had some interest into Playboy models, and I sort of like their figure. But in young age, my interest wasn't very sexual, it was more aesthetic, but slowly over the year, my interest was more sexual, and while I wanted sex around 11 years old, I knew that was not the right time to consider it, but I did like the idea though. I had fantasies such as participating in 4somes with ladies at a really young age, and I enjoyed them. Moments and moments confirms that I am practically a heterosexual. 

And then, at some point during the age of 15-16.5, sexual thoughts/needs start diminishing. I haven't really noticed for few months until I started questioning why do I not have sexual needs anymore or why is my needs less stronger over time. You see here, no where at this point or that point did I wish I am asexual. Anyways, I started accepting that I was going to be permanently asexual for the rest of my life when my sexuality was so diminished that I could say that I am like my 8 years old self in terms of sexuality, and then practically very much asexual with libido remaining intact.

Fast forward to college, I have not experience sexuality. Not once in my entire college section did I experience sexual needs. Not even in my current time in university. As a matter of fact, I don't remember the last time I had a legit sexual dream after my sexuality died. Nada. 0 sexual dream. I don't even remember certain sexual feelings I used to have. They're foreign at this point. If I try to imagine myself being a sexual again, it'd be like trying to imagine what it like to be a past person, and it seem like you used to be this person and you have memories of this person. Something like that. That's how foreign it is. 

And every time I looked back, confusion simply doesn't explain why my sexuality seemingly has shifted. It was quite very inconsistent with that explanation. I couldn't explain it other than my sexuality changed on it own.

--------
That's my background, so why am I mentioning my background and why did I create this thread?

My message for those people who wants to become asexual, here's my take on it:

While I understand why it is appealing as I know what it like to be on two sides of the coin, and I understand exactly that you didn't ask to have sexuality in the first place. Well, many asexuals do not accept that they have a libido, and it is not their own fault. The best you can do is to try to accept that you have a sexuality, and if you doubt that you'll ever accept it, there's no way out of it. Trying to go celibate is not going to get rid of those thoughts at all. Yes, there are people like me, but those are few of the thousands out there. ",Asexual

From my experiences, people know more about the ace community(I mean, it's still almost nothing but...) and most don't know about the aro community(or they think it's the same), so that might be the reason... How about you guys? Do you feel this difference?

How do you turn down someone without coming out as aro/ace?,"Last year I met a girl whose company I really enjoy. She became a great friend, but over time I began to notice that she thought of me as more than a friend.

I had sincerely thought we were mutually okay with just being friends, but I've heard otherwise. We hang out regularly, but she apparently plans on making a move on me very soon.

Looking back, I wish I had an explicit conversation with her about how I just wanted to be friends. But I didn't, so I guess I have to face the consequences now.

I'm asexual and probably aromantic too. I don't have any interest in dating, and I've never had a crush before. I have my own important reasons for being ""in the closet"" right now, but how am I supposed to turn her down then?

Finally know who I am. Just wanted to share.,"After a lot of soul searching following about five years of uncomfortable experiences, pained relationships and a surprising amount of rage at myself, I arrived at the solution. There's nothing wrong with me, this is just something I don't want. I'm not repulsed by sex and I can still appreciate physical attraction - I'm just not interested in it.

It's a weird sort of impasse to arrive at. My sister is bisexual and my mother is a lesbian. I was never raised with any expectations of sexuality or gender just gently encouraged to be who I wanted to be. 

I guess it's just tricky realising it as a 26 year old man surrounded by single people looking to settle down or play around for a bit longer. I do still feel romantically but I don't think I could expect a hetero woman to settle for conversation, coffee and the odd big hug.

I was sexually abused for much of my life, and so I didn't even have any concept of what its really supposed to be like. I have panic attacks, feel physically sick, get depressed, scared. Have flashbacks. I still have nightmares.
 I didn't know what love was, or attraction was. I was always told I was ugly, so I'm able to identify what features make someone attractive. But I've never been attracted that way.

Then I fell in love, and it confused me so bad for so long. She was beautiful, I was attracted to her eyes, her smile, everything. But I still never had any desire to have sex. She knew how I felt, she loved me, and didn't want it if I wasn't going to be happy with it. I noticed she'd cut herself off from taking the kissing or cuddling too far, she would feel guilty and say sorry. I realized that I didn't feel uncomfortable with it though.
I didn't have a desire to have sex with her, but I did want her to be happy. So we did it one time, I guess it was sort of uneventful except for when she was satisfied. I was just happy shecould have what she wanted, she said she had never felt closer to me.
Well I have a daughter now, her mother decided that her and I weren't enough to live for and so she killed herself. I'm so confused about everything. What I am and what it all means. What I should or shouldn't have done.

I’m sorry, I just really need to get this off my chest.

I don’t desire to have sex with other people, and yet I have a very high libido. I feel the desire to masturbate on a daily basis, to the point where it’s distracting and irritating me throughout school/work. 

When I finally have the opportunity to satisfy that urge, it doesn’t even work half the time. What the hell am I supposed to masturbate to if I don’t want to have sex?? How idiotic can my body be to still send these signals for sexual desire?

Problems suppressing sex drive,"Hello. I am currently having issues with feeling sexual desires. For the past year or so I have been able to mostly eliminate my physical desires making my life much simpler.

Anti-depressants normally make this very easy for me but the last several medications have not been properly killing my drive. I am starting to feel things that I do not have the ability to cope with currently. I have tried various forms of meditation and lifestyle and diet changes to help this suppression but it is not working.

I am not in a place where I can deal with these feelings properly. I most certainly am not able to fulfill these desires. In the past these kinds of feelings have been tied to suicide attempts and self harm and potentially even worse things.

I am also broke and unemployed so no real medical coverage minus what the government gives to someone like me. I am looking for a cheap, effective, and accessible way to eliminate this problem. I would prefer a permanent solution as I don't particularly want to ever feel these feelings again and I will never be able to fulfill them.

Protections for Asexuals in the United States (cross post r/asexuality),"So, going to start off with a fun fact for yall, this is Washington State's definition of sexual orientation AKA that thing that's used to, among many things, protect minority sexual identities from discrimination: 
&gt;(26) ""Sexual orientation"" means **heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality**, and gender expression or identity. As used in this definition, ""gender expression or identity"" means having or being perceived as having a gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression, whether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior, or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the sex assigned to that person at birth.
Notice anything missing? I do: asexuality, or really even an actual definition of sexual orientation. It's a list, seriously you can [read it] (https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.60.040). So, I've written my state reps back in August to try and get this definition changed to be more inclusive, and heard back from one saying they'll look into it, but the more people in our state gov who are aware of this the more likely we can successfully make this definition more inclusive.

If you aren't from Washington, but still in the United States, you're probably not looking any better, accept for New York. According to [this](http://acesandallies.org/about-us/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality#Discrimination_and_legal_protections) (I list Wikipedia as well since that first site, appears to be dead as of a few years ago) New York is the only state to explicitly protect asexuals from discrimination, and while I agree, you'd probably win any legal battle over someone pulling whatever $@#t that still doesn't help the larger problem of asexual invisibility.

So what I'm saying is that if this has made you want to help, write you're state representatives, it's election season, and they are listening! Let's make something happen because I was genuinely surprised that we were left out in the cold, and this shouldn't be some big controversial fight, it's something good we can do for the community to raise awareness.

"I'm a sex-repulsed asexual, but what the hell is going on? Probably NSFW/TMI/whatever.","I consider myself sex-repulsed, since PIV sex is the absolute worst thing I could ever experience on this planet and I want nothing to do with it. 

However, I'm massively kinky (soft Dom/sub, and soft S&amp;M seem to be my vibe), I have a moderate-to-high libido (frequent masturbation, reduces stress and anxiety, but also feels good), and I'm actually not repulsed by all sexual contact. I desire to do many of these things with my partner, such as mutual masturbation, frottage, etc. Fluids don't typically disgust me, and genitalia doesn't typically disgust me except for in circumstances where those things are unwanted. 

I actually get frustrated (in much the way an allo might) when my boyfriend rejects me or is not interested in these things. My boyfriend would rather have sex, but out of respect, he doesn't pressure me or expect it. Likewise, I don't pressure him because I hate being pressured myself and he absolutely has a right to say no just as I do. My boyfriend typically does these things just to please me, but knowing that, defeats it a lot for me. I'm like an allo that substitutes other things for sex, I guess? He and I are at an odd stalemate.

I believe I may be asexual.,"I’m 17 years old and have never felt sexual attraction for anyone. Never had much of an issue with boners, nor do I enjoy masturbating - it feels more like a chore my body sometimes need and something I’d rather do without.

Neither men or women arouse me, seeing porn sometimes makes me get an erection but most of the time it’s only because I’m focused on getting the “chore” done as quickly as possible.

I don’t know if I feel romantical attraction, the closest thing to it I feel is the deep care I feel towards my closest friends - but in my mind they’re that and that only, I’ve never seen them otherwise.

Honestly I have no interest in sex, it just seems too much of a hassle.

After writing this out I have to say I am convinced I am asexual, but still, I wanted to get it out.",Asexual
I think i might be a G-Ace,"Hey everyone. I've recently been doing some self auditing after some very positive mind opening acid trips and come to acknowledge (among other things) that i am if, not Ace then a very low libido g-Ace. 

First off, I have always been a very blasè person in the sense that i don't really let a lot get under my skin and tend to be content in what ever situation i find myself in. Im not certain that i dont have a sex drive or just don't feel the urge to seek out someone. 

I spent most of my high school days socialising with the girls since i found the machismo of guys unbearable after more than a few hours. At the moment, I'm 20 living with a group of my male friends from school, all students (i work full-time) i see their constant drive to find girls and get laid on a day to day basis. These kinds of feelings i see in my friends just dont line up with what i see or feel when I look at or spend time with girl. My first sexual experience was with my first girlfriend and even then (i was 16) I didn't feel any urge to do the deed and only really did it to because i wanted to please my gf of the time. That being said i did want to do it for my self aswell but looking back it was similar to wanting your first beer. 

Whenever i do have sex i find i dont feel any different mentally, i spend all the time focusing on the girl and how she's reacting and feeling, and to be honest couldn't give a rats ass about me and whether i cum. I have actually had to fake it a few times with my most recent gf who i had almost no emotional connection with. I do masturbate but only as ""cleaning out the pipes"" type thing and watch porn, but again that's only to force arousal on my self in order to masturbate. 

Im not really sure what I'm typing all this information for but this is something I've never expressed to anyone. I had heard of asexuality before, and then saw Todd from Bojack Horseman's representation of asexuality and found it really resonated with me. After a few weeks of having the idea that i might be ace bouncing around my head i decided to do some research and decided to turn to reddit as i usually do when trying to find information and came across this subreddit.

Please i would like anyone's opinion on where i sit, whether i even do or not. I honestly have very little insecurity and have never considered my low libido a problem for myself but i have always felt fundamentally different from my guy friends for some reason or another. If you do think i fall under the ace umbrella please share  thoughts because i feel this would really help towards discovering and acknowledging myself for who I really am.

Sorry for the format, I'm typing this on my phone.

Lots of love to you all!",Asexual
Could i possibly be aromantic?,I used to be a bit of a ladies man when I was ateenager. But since a break up I had back then I sort of lost my personality. I don't think I could get a relationship but I don't particularly desire one either. I am lonely sometimes but it doesn't make me want a girlfriend. I can't picture having one and I see no benefits of having one. I'd much rather stay single. I just need something to fulfill my time that's all. I lost my sex drive also to antidepressants so that's sort of the icing on the cake. I do kind of browse tinder but I think that's only because I feel like it's normal to want a girlfriend but whenever I have a date I chicken out anyway I don't really know why. It just seems most people in my sort of situation are craving intimacy but im not really bothered anymore,Asexual
Released - 2015 Ace Community Census Summary Findings,"Happy Asexual Awareness Week! We are excited to share with you the summary results from the 2015 census.

* Download the 2015 Ace Census Summary Report (pdf file): [2015 Ace Community Census Summary Report] (https://asexualcensus.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2015_ace_census_summary_report.pdf)


* You can also view the original survey text (pdf file): [Ace Survey 2015 – View Questions] (https://asexualcensus.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2015_survey.pdf)


We know it has been a long time coming, but we have considerably more volunteers as of very recently and should be able to get reports out faster in the future. One of the main reasons this report took so long is that we back coded, or read through and included all write in responses where we could. This is time intensive and should be more manageable with a larger number of volunteers. You might also notice that this report is a bit longer than 2014, which also took additional time.


Also, many thanks to everyone who took the survey! We couldn’t have done it without you.

the queer community...,it is so horribly aphobic. it makes me want to give up. especially this week they show they don't have basic respect for people who don't fit their narrative,Asexual
How do allosexuals live with the constant urges?,"I consider myself a G-Ace. Although I have heard of the term for quite some time, I delved deeper into the subject only recently. 

I was in an abusive relationship for some time, did not enjoy the relationship, did not enjoy the sex. I never heard of asexuality at the time and concluded that the sex was not interesting because of the stress and constant bickering. I consider sex as an integral part of a relationship and something I will have to compromise. I had to mentally prepare myself for sex like watching porn or reading about my kinks at times when I'm not in the mood. 

When I broke off the abusive relationship, I went on to explore my sexuality. I felt weirded out that sex is just meh to me or sometimes boring, or sometimes I don't enjoy at all. Girl friends suggested I masturbate and touch myself to explore what ticks. Got bored of that. I'd rather play video games instead. I thought I was broken. I've had many guys over the course of my singlehood to find out what's wrong, even bed the guys who advertised themselves as skilled but turned out meh, nothing new, nothing special. 

I got into a monogamous relationship. I then found out the glaring disparity in our in our sexual urges. Recent turn of events made me research into asexuality more and maybe finally accept who I am. I got frustrated of what I read. I want to enjoy sex or be sexually attracted to someone as much as the next person but my body just isn't built for it. I began to look back and finally understood why I very rarely get attracted to someone. I can only remember the one time I looked at a topless guy on a billboard and wanting to touch his chest. I cannot remember any other moments of the same occurrences.

When I finally accepted who I am, it was a liberating experience. I am not broken. I don't have to make sexual compromises. I don't have to force myself to want sex. I am who I am because it's how my body is.

Now since I am a G, there are random moments when I feel instense want for sex. I cannot predict when the urges come but when it does, I can't stop thinking about it that it sometimes affects my productivity. The feeling is good but I can't imagine living with it constantly. I wonder if this is how allosexuals feel. If so, how do they live with it?",Asexual
"Do you think it's important to ""come out"" to my family?","I've accepted that I was asexual for a while now. I'm fourteen years old and ever since I learned what sex was, I was completely disgusted by it and still am. I'm also probably somewhat aromantic because I really don't seem to care about relationships as much as other people do. I'll still get crushes here and there but I don't have that same desperation to be with the person as other people do.

Thing is, only my older sister knows. I didn't really feel anything when I told her and it felt very casual, and it's not like I told her just to tell her- it just came up in conversation. 

I kind of want the rest of my family to know because my mom seems to, and I'm just making assumptions here, think that I watch porn or something because I'm always wearing headphones and hiding my computer from her, and the thought of her thinking that I do that just grosses me out. That's the one good reason I have to tell anyone, otherwise I feel like it's not important at all and that nobody needs to know. 

I may be wrong, though. I would actually appreciate some advice :)",Asexual
Is it pointless?,"I feel like getting into a relationship is dooming my SO to a sad passionless relationship. I can pretend, but I can just never feel it. I won't ever have that chemistry that makes me want to rip their clothes off. Or have that strange primal attraction when you look into their eyes. 

I've been doing so much research on sexuality since I've come to terms with being ace. And what I learned is that people really base their relationships off of sexual attraction. Which is pretty crazy that in addition to all the qualities you look for in a SO, you also have to worry about that. But they will be feeling an intense attraction towards me and I'll be faking or rejecting them. I feel like being with an allosexual is depriving them of something. And it's just making me sad.

Is anyone else watching Big Mouth?,"It's on Netflix, a cartoon about puberty, basically. I was watching it and because the show is all about sexual awakening, etc, it really hit me that I never really had that. 

It's very weird to watch this show and realize that somehow, all of that awkward attraction and experimentation somehow skipped me? Anyone else feeling the same? ",Asexual

"""Maybe get that checked out...""","So recently online I was in a conversation (this has happened more than once) and I brought up that fact that I wad ace (I am specifically grey-ace, but that can be hard to explain to I stick with the easier label).  I mentioned that I wad 17 and don't experience being ""horny as hell"" almost ever (like once or twice in my whole life).  At that point, they brought up that maybe there was actually something wrong with me, as in my lack of sexual attraction was a medical issue.  I was just kind of surprised this was mentioned.  I don't know if it's exactly the same thing, but wouldn't that almost be like telling a gay person there's a medical issue because they're not into the opposite sex?

xpost: Ace or just Low Libido? Was in Serious Relationship for 3+ Years,"Hey Everyone! Long time stalker, first time poster.

I'm still trying to figure out my sexuality. Long story short, one of my best friends &amp; I entered into a relationship and were together for about 2 and half/3 years. He blind-sided me by breaking off the relationship for reasons I don't want go into other than it was both of our first relationship. He was also the only person I have slept with. Whether or not we remain friends after, I have no idea, but I'm incredibly disappointed in him and how he handled the situation.

Anywho, so here is the question: I do enjoy the feeling of oral sex (giving and receiving), sex was always hit or miss, I enjoyed some aspects of dressing up ""sexy"" or doing some kind of foreplay/roleplaying. Also, I do masturbate because it feels really good.

I was/am attracted to my ex(really strange calling him that) very much - but those sexual feelings are far and few between when it comes to people, and sometimes it takes until I am friends with someone before any sort of attraction happens (like, I can tell someone it attractive but not necessarily be attracted to them). Like even growing up, all of my friends would go nuts for a shirtless guy, and I'm sitting over here not really being turned on. Like some things manipulate me into being turned on (i.e. certain way that films compose a shot of a sex scene vs. just straight up porn), but yeah...usually there's not a whole lot going on in the sexual feelings department.

So...is this considered being Ace? Or is this somewhere under the umbrella? Or is it just a low libido?

I rarely call myself asexual because I'm still doing research, and I don't want to disrespect anyone who IS Ace by claiming to be something I may not be. Basically, I'm still trying to figure myself out. I just feel it's important to have some sort of label so I can really know who I am and embrace it.

Thanks!

Ace Dom,Are there any ace people here who do have sex and enjoy being a Dom? I love having sex with my boyfriend because it's not about me. It's an activity I can do with him where I can give him so much pleasure and it never has to be centred on me. Sometimes we do have penetrative sex but only when i feel like I can please him more by doing that because I love him. And I'm the Dom so I call the shots. I'd be interested to hear if this is common in the ace community because it's a way to engage in sex without having to actually have penetrative sex or being touched sexually. ,Asexual
am I asexual? I don't want to be,"I thought I was asexual from when I was younger until later in high school when I decided I was bi but basically gay. I don't really get crushes on people or feel much of what I imagine 'physical attraction' should feel like. Like my boyfriend was talking about his sex drive being high and how it was annoying and i just feel really jealous. 

I don't know like it bothers me because I WANT to want these things but I just feel so disinterested. It's like I'm forcing myself to like/want something 

i guess asexuality is separte from sex drive so maybe mine is just very low and it's some hormonal thing or issue i can get fixed 
if I was asexual would I feel this way? like that i want to feel feelings but i don't and it's frustrating?

Just wanted to say thanks to this sub and the FAQ thread for helping me with developing a character for my book!,"Hey guys! Writer here, and I've been trawling through the complex world of sexuality trying to determine how a character's intimate relationship with another person compares to real-life relationships. In short, it's sci-fi and a relationship with a non-human, so I had difficulties convincing myself there could be sexual attraction.

After reading a few posts and the FAQ thread in this sub, I got the breakthrough I needed for developing my character's details. Now that I know she's asexual, her relationship barely needs tweaking in the slightest!

Ace Characters?,"I'm really curious if anyone knows of any shows/movies/books/etc, that have openly ace characters in them.

",Asexual
Socially conditioned asexuality..?,"Hey there! I've been keeping a big question mark over my confused admission of being chaotically asexual, and thought maybe y'all could help, either by sharing your advice, or similar stories.

So, especially with the current events in Hollywood etc, and the responses being shared by so many out there, I have finally found a way to describe what I think motivates (or demotivates) me sexually, and was curious if any other people, but more likely men, feel this way.

I spent most of my time growing up and in college with women and gay men, despite being pretty dead certain I'm exclusively cis male, in a vacuum. I'm not sure why I never made friends with other straight men, I have brothers and no sisters, women always just seemed 'cooler' to me, and I wished deeply to know them and know things about them--how the other half lived, per say. I've also always had a general distaste for the primitive behavior of men. I don't want to get caught in the weeds talking about various details from over the years, but through spending time listening to female friends talk about how shitty and objectifying men were/are to them, to our friends, etc, and having had more than my fair share of aggressive men try to play ball with me in ways that have deeply turned me off to sexual advancement, I've adopted what I feel like is socially conditioned asexuality. Empathetic asexuality. I want people to feel safe with me. Safety, however, seems to be the antithesis of everything I know about what makes sex exciting to most people. Safety does not sexually excite me either, it just is the imperative preference.  

The idea of making someone feel unsafe, or uncomfortable around me due to perceived sexual attraction/desire is nauseating to me. I've chosen, over the years, to place Trust as my highest desired thing from someone I care about, and sex tends to make trust weird, for many dynamics. As a response, I think I killed my native attraction to women, or ability to be attracted to people at all--why risk it? Why risk being the predator in their life? Why risk losing a friend or connection just to get my damn rocks off? I know the way certain men and women have made me feel, and I simply refuse to be the perpetrator of such things. Its gotten so bad that I don't believe people who say they're attracted to me, either. I don't understand what the feeling is, or means, and so I can't pin down what they think they mean either, or what they think they want from me. When its sex, I end up giving it to them, because that is what is what normal people do, and on the flip side, they get very upset when you don't follow through after a certain point. I perform to the best of my abilities, which has been enough for them, but never the thing I needed myself. 

This isn't healthy, for me, I don't think. I want to own my sexual identity, and let my potential flourish (I've gotten strong feedback from partners, despite not enjoying sex much myself) but the second I'm attracted to someone at all, I reflexively kill it off, or clarify it to myself to the point of useless abstraction. Sometimes, I see these kinds of pressures produce kinks in people. I am honest enough with myself to go to the deep dark places. I'm not hiding a kink from myself, I just can't let myself drum up a desire, because my desire is someone else's pain, or so I have been made to believe. 

Anyone else feel like they might be asexual as a social condition, rather than...well...I'm sure we all have weird reasons for being here. Idk. Halp?

Where do you find understanding girlfriend?,Since I took antidepressants my sex drive is considerably low. So I guess you could say that makes me asexual.

"Haven't had sex this year and don't miss it.. confused, advice please?","Hey all,

I've literally just learnt asexuality is a thing and I'm really confused. I'm a guy in my late twenties. I was married to someone I was with for seven years and she eventually had an affair. We had sex once every six week to three months when I had to really. I just didn't really enjoy sex or look forward to it. We had seperate beds and I guess just drifted apart. Since then, I've had two girlfriends. One who made me have sex almost every day and I was miserable, the other I managed to not have to but we broke up.

I'm with a new girl now, it's been about a month and we haven't done more than kiss. I met her friends and one asked me why we hadn't had sex yet and I was just like 'taking things slow'. But I've realised I just don't really want to. But I don't really want to with anyone. As the title says, I haven't had sex this year and I really don't care about that fact. I realised I don't really look at women (or men) and ever have that physical desire. I can think people are pretty or beautiful but just don't have those urges or thoughts. But yet I love being in a relationship? I love cuddling and holding hands. I like all the coupley stuff you do? Any advice on if possibly I'm asexual? If not, what could I be? Where should I look or go to figure this out? Thanks for any replies.",Asexual
Gender Expression I Guess?,"So I recently discovered I'm on the ace spectrum (cool I suppose).  Anyways, I'm a female but I've never felt super in touch with my femininity, not have I ever felt the opposite (masculine).  I've always expressed my gender in a very neutral way, both clothing and attitude wise.  I'm beginning to wonder if my asexuality has any thing to do with this?  Does anyone else feel like their sexuality and gender expression are some how linked?",Asexual
[NSFW] from sex-repulsed to sex-neutral maybe,"hello, y'all. first of all, I'm kinda sad I can't make virgin sacrifice jokes anymore...
something I think should be more deeply discussed in the ace community is the fluidity of some identities. the person who runs ace meetings in a city nearby is actually aceflux, and I think that gives us a good chance to give aces with fluid identities more visibility.
when I mention sex-repulsion in my FB page, I often remind people it can be fluid, it can have exceptions just like sex-favorable folks have their no-nos, etc. huh, and little did I know I'd be experiencing a type of fluidity. for a long time for now I've considered myself sex-repulsed; even though I draw porn, I've always said to myself that no-one can 'press my buttons' as well as I do - and that's still true, I just happened to find someone who 'presses my buttons' just good enough for me to consent - not enough to make me climax though; shame on him XD but the point is, I can tell what looks hot in a drawing, but up to now nothing's ever felt 'consentable' to me. as I mentioned, I draw porn and I already know my body pretty well, so this definitely isn't a 'finding the right person' person kind of thing, but I guess I can say my feelings towards sex changed from repulsion to neutrality. I guess that's something I should update on my FA profile. still no one can 'press my buttons' as good as I can do. 2D sex &gt; 3D sex; but homemade vegan sausages are better than both.

TL;DR: I never felt like having sex, but my furiend gave me a BJ and turns out I'm sex-neutral under certain circumstances.",Asexual
Are You Happy? (x-post r/AsexualMen),https://www.reddit.com/r/AsexualMen/comments/76mx34/weekly_discussion_15th_october_2017_are_you_happy/,Asexual
Sooo... I'm confused,"...and to be perfectly honest, I'm scared of claiming something that I'm mistaken about. Sorry, let me back up a bit. Sorry in advance if this gets super long \^^;;

So, a few days ago I got back to thinking about my orientation again. Over the years there have been many times where I've paused, and asked myself, ""am I asexual, even a little?"", but my misunderstanding of asexuality almost always led me to wave off those thoughts because I thought having a sex drive negated that. Over the last couple days though, I've been diving headfirst into as much research as I can, and after being initially overwhelmed by just how amazingly deep and nuanced sexuality can be, not to mention the distinctions between aesthetic, romantic, sensual, and sexual attraction, I think I'm starting to put the pieces together...

The part I'm struggling to pin down is just how to define sexual attraction. The confusing part is that I'm a very tactile person, and I used to think my strong desire to be physically close to my partner was sexual, but after reading more on the differences between sexual and sensual I'm left wondering whether or not I can differentiate... like, I'm not certain if my physical desires are sexual or purely sensual. The more I try to think about it and suss out the details, the more I start to think I'm overanalyzing everything. 

I find myself nodding along to a lot of the ""I'd rather _____ than have sex"" meme and in reality, no, I really don't ...care. But when I think about what I DO want to do with a partner, everything I'm drawn to is sensual, but intensely so... but is that just me being very sensual and treasuring the emotional weight of that? Idk. I guess... if I had to describe it, what that intensity feels like, it's like a glow... like the core of my being is radiating a warm light, blindingly intense, so much so that it's practically physical, and all I want most is to be pressed against her physically, in intimate contact, feel her skin, her heartbeat, her breathing, feel her warmth fill me... all just to be close to her, to share that glow, that feeling of being safe and content in each other's arms... when I describe it like that, I can't imagine a more intense feeling, but at no point to I stop to ask if sex is involved. I mean, for me I guess... should I be taking that as a sign that my desire is sensual/romantic? I mean... really it was only a couple days ago that I learned there was a difference between the sensual and the sexual, and something like that would have been classified by me as sexual, hands down. 

So... I'm really having a hard time trying to figure out what sounds and feel a right for me now that I'm expanding my understanding of what I really am. From what I've read and been able to understand, I think I'd be more comfortable identifying gray, possibly demi, but the problem is really that I'm unsure of how to classify sexual desire and separate it or, more aptly, contrast it with sensual desire. I'm unsure if I've actually experienced sexual attraction or just a deep sensual desire to touch and feel. Is there a difference between wanting to have sex, and wanting to explore the sensual and pleasurable sensation of intercourse? I mean on more than one occasion I've seen amazingly drawn hips and thought ""I really want to hold those, feel them, feel then pressing against me."" But is that just a combination of aesthetic attraction and sensual attraction? Is that even possible? I mean... it tend to begin with seeing a beautiful shape, curved in a beautiful slope, and then the idea of pressingbmy hands into the soft, supple flesh and feeling it push back against my hands... then again I feel like I could have the same desire to touch and kneed warm dough. Actually... now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure it feels much different from the desire to press my fluffy, overweight cat to my chest and feel the weight of her warm body... wow that kind of...puts things in perspective... 

Sorry to ramble on, I'm posting this after being up all night 3rd shift. Kind of losing focus. I just... it's going to drive me crazy until I ask about it and talk to someone outside my own head, preferably people that understand what I'm trying to figure out, you know? 

Thank you very much in advance for your time. ",Asexual
Slut shamed despite being asexual,"So I recently confirmed myself as being asexual, I have literally no sexual interest, no matter what hot celebrity (male/female) decide to have sex with me I will probably do it only because I can brag about it, not because I enjoy it.

Confused about whether or not I'm asexual.,"So I'm really confused about whether or not I'm asexual.. I'm 17, female and I've never had a partner before. I've identified as pansexual for a while but I'm not sure if I'm asexual because I do find people attractive and I definetly want to try sex but I don't feel like it's one of my top priorities and I don't really get 'turned on'. I asked a friend about this and she said that she doesn't think I am because she never really felt sexual attraction/drive until she was about to have sex. So I'm really confused. I know that I am definetly not aromantic though because I am one of the cheesiest people you will ever meet and I love romance stories and I know that I am Pan as well because I get attracted to guys, girls and everything in between. So I'm just really confused... should I wait until I get into a relationship and then see how I feel? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",Asexual

Sexuality and Sensuality as an emotional connection,"I saw a tumblr post yesterday (that I can't find!! Ugh) that told the differences between Sexuality, Romanticism, Sensuality, and one other thing in regards to asexuality and aromanticism. It basically talked about how not everything is sexual and romantic in a relationship. What mostly struck me was sensuality, which I'd never really heard of on the same scale as sexuality before.

Does anyone know any resources that talk about that? Because that sounds like me. I'm sort of romantic, I like the idea of long walks on the beach and flowers and that stuff, but I don't like the idea of being infatuated with anyone, and I don't really like or hate sex, just indifferent (meh). But sensuality... it clicks something with me. I love to cuddle, I love to touch people (appropriately!!), but I also feel so touched starved from holding back. I hug my friends more often than I should, and I truly do try and hold back, but it hurts. And the idea of someone coming up behind me and giving me a hug from behind, GOD that's better than sex in my book.

"I don’t know what I am. Am I demisexual, antisocial, or just heartbroken?","I was in a long distance relationship through most of college. I never went to a party and met someone/talked to anyone/hooked up. I got out of that relationship before my senior year. During that time I fumbled around, couldn’t really meet anyone, and ended up dating one girl whom I had known for like two years. 

That girl and I broke up . I was convinced I was going to marry this girl. During our relationship we had sex when we were together, but when we were apart due to work, I was never interested in sexting/phone sex/exchanging nudes. 

I just moved to a very large city for grad school. I miss my ex. I miss being in a relationship. I don’t feel any need to have sex. I literally haven’t had any desire to try and seek out sex from someone else. I can’t even picture myself having sex with someone. I can look at someone and objectively say that they are attractive, but that doesn’t ever translate into motivation to get to know them or talk to them. 

I also don’t feel any need to try and talk to any women who I see at bars/on campus/at concerts. Often I don’t even feel like making the effort to meet someone is worth it. I also keep thinking that getting to know someone is too much work. 

I know I don’t want to be alone. I miss being in an emotionally intimate relationship with her. So am I demisexual, antisocial, or just heartbroken? ",Asexual
"Loneliness and ""missing out""","Recently, I came to the conclusion that I'm on the ace spectrum (I currently say I'm grey ace) and that was a massively relieving thing for me, I found people who were like me.  But here's the issue, I have some issues with feeling like I'm ""missing out"" and can sometimes feel lonely.  I have a desire to be in a relationship, cuddle, and just share emotional intimacy with someone.  I'm also fucking terrified at this thought.  I simultaneously feel like I'd be inconvenienced by a relationship, or held down by one, and also terrified I'll never be in one.  

Does anyone else have this kind of struggle?  I'm genuinely curious.  I see many of my friends in relationships (and I love that idea) but I also very rarely feel attracted to people like that and feel like it could be a burden.  Maybe I'll never know until I try, but I'm afraid no one is looking for a person like me. ",Asexual
"Aromantic, but in denial?","Ever since I first discovered asexuality years ago, I’ve identified as a romantic ace. But looking back on my romantic history, I’m not sure if this makes sense.

In ninth grade, I met a girl, we talked non-stop for days, and I asked her out. After the first date, something felt different and I wanted nothing to do with her.

I had a “girlfriend” for most of tenth grade. She didn’t go to my school so we spent every moment together after school. We went on dates and all of that. But we never even went so far as to hold hands, much less kiss. But we still said we were dating. I think this eventually led to a strain and that’s why we broke up.

In eleventh grade and twelfth grade, I met some girls here or there and I went on a few dates. But it always ended with me noping out and usually cutting the girl out of my life. 

I honestly feel like a prick for going through this constant cycle, but I so desperately want to be romantic. Everything sounds good in theory- cuddling, kissing, etc. But maybe I don’t actually like those things at all.

It bothers me that to determine if I’m aromantic, I have to engage in romantic activity. But if I continue to do this I will only confuse or even hurt more girls. (Please don’t think that sentence means I’m some kind of desirable heart throb.)

Broaching the topic to those who don't know,"So.

I'm entering a relationship with someone. It's my first relationship! I kinda like him, all good. The problem is I'm ace and sex repulsed and not even big on being touched. He's the kind of boy I would sum up as... 'normie'? He's very regular, and I doubt he knows anything about sub cultures/etc.

So while I'm sure this is something that can wait (we could still not work out), I'm quite nervous about what to do if he does want to progress to more sexual things. Any normal rate (god, I don't know what that is beyond tropes- kiss on first, sex by third?) would be way too fast for me.

I think I'd be okay with having sex if we went slow, like really slow, but I'm worried that bc we aren't amazing close bffs first before dating, he might just lose interest/think I'm weird. I guess I'd be okay with that, better to be with someone who understands, but still. It's a topic I don't really know how to broach without feeling weird and silly and maybe implying something is wrong with me.

I'm content with who I am, but again, I'm like 99% sure he's a straight dude who knows nothing about lgbt stuff, let alone ace ones. I really like him, but the idea of dating him is throwing me through a loop because the implication of kissing/touch/sex is too much for me to go through. Bringing it up too early is presumptuous, bringing it up when it comes up.... we'll see? :/",Asexual
Am i asexual or maybs grey asexual?,"I'm new here so please excuse me if this is against the rules or whatever. 
I was in love once about 8 years ago. This is the only girl I can honestly say I was in love with. I have had girls I've been attracted to aswell around that time. A short time after this  i  developed mental health problems which effected my personality amongst other things. I haven't thought about women the same way since. Some of it stems from having no self belief that I just don't see the point in caring about women. But I definitely don't feel attraction to women nowadays. I gradually started caring less about seeing other couples and wanting that for myself. I won't lie I have been on online dating websites but whenever a date opportunity presents itself I back away from it. I don't know exactly why. 
The thought of being forever alone doesn't scare me and I don't understand people who get so hepped up about not having a partner. The only benefit I see is having someone there to keep you from being bored (I live by myself and it can get boring) but I still don't see that as good enough reason to get a gf. I have low libido due to antidepressants I took but I'm leaning more onto aromantic I think? What do you guys think?",Asexual
Figuring out my sexuality is giving me severe anxiety,"Hi, I've been really anxious about ""what I am"" lately and it's sort of affecting my life and productivity so I kind of just needed to rant about this and if anyone has advice that'd be cool? (If you don't feel like reading this whole thing the last paragraph is the most important imo.)

Basically up until I was about 16 I assumed I was ""straight"". I had emotional crushes on guys since I was 9 year old, but when I was 16 and my friends started to become sexually active, I would hear about what they did and was kind of like ""no thanks""? I hadn't kissed anyone yet but the idea of sex kind of grossed me out, and I didn't really know what arousal was or if I was 'aroused'. I started to identify as asexual and I told my mom and one friend.

However when I was 17 I met this guy and I was head over heels for him. I had really  strong emotional feelings towards him and as we started to have a sexual relationship I sort of abandoned the asexual label. Although I still wasn't sure what ""arousal"" meant. If we were making out I started to feel like, warm down there I guess? And when we started to have sex I definitely felt 'aroused' + orgasmed. But I still wasn't really sure what arousal was. I wouldn't look at guys on the street and think ""I need your dick inside me"". I would usually just be like ""oh he's super cute"" or ""I enjoy looking at that man's muscles"". However I knew for sure that I very much enjoyed being in a relationship with a man, and having sex with a man.

About a year after that I started to think I might be bisexual, or bi-something. For a long time I saw pictures of girls and would think ""oh hey I enjoy looking at that"" but I thought for a while that it was just aesthetic appreciation. But then I started to feel something close to ""arousal"" in my private area? I guess? Like it would sort of jump or something, and it really confused me. I still wouldn't be thinking ""I want to fuck that girl"" the same way my mind doesn't think that when I see hot guys, but my body had some sort of reaction and it seriously freaked me out, especially because there was nothing going on mentally.

Side note, idk if this is relevant but I have never had the desire to masturbate and I still have never masturbated in my life.

Now I'm 19 and it's really taking a toll on my mental health. I'm dating a male again and I'm very happy in our relationship both physically and emotionally. I enjoy having m/f sex and I experience sexual pleasure from it, but I don't really know if I fully experience ""sexual attraction"" towards males. I definitely like looking at them, but I'm not sure what ""sexual attraction"" consists of. I also don't really know how I feel towards women sexually. I've never felt anything emotionally towards a woman and I've never felt like I ""want to fuck"" a woman but I definitely feel like I have a slightly stronger physical ""sexual desire"" for women? Maybe? I honestly have no clue and it's stressing me out so much. I don't know what kind of label to put on myself, and I'm worried that I'm lying to myself about something but I don't know what it would even be. I just constantly feel the need to put myself in a box and if I can't decide a word or label for what I'm feeling, then I'm confused or broken or something. I really could use some advice.

Sex gives me anxiety.,"I(f) am currently divorcing my husband who has an extremely high libido (I promise there are more reasons than this that contribute to this decision). I have little to none. Don't get me wrong, I love intimacy. The kissing, cuddling, occasional fondling; I enjoy with men and women. But actual sex? I have no desire. Granted, I've had a few sexual relationships with women, but my only real sexual relationship with a male was my soon-to-be ex-husband.

I remember our first time and it wasn't anything like I thought. I was actually bored with it. Right away. But I just continued to do it because it was what I thought I should do. Six years, I've been forcing myself to be sexual. I could put it off for a couple weekz, maybe a month, before my husband would get upset enough to make me feel guilty enough to have sex. And I always hated it. I would pretend for his sake, but I couldn't wait to be done. 

I always preferred to be the one who go down on my girlfriend's, avoiding any reciprocation. Other than sex, I love every other aspect of relationships, from simple attraction to full blown hot and heavy make out sessions with the occasional grope. But the thought of full blown sex or even memories of previous sexual encounters, makes my chest tighten and turns my stomach into knots.

"""Find a new crush"" had been terrible advice. Anyone the same?","So here's the thing, I recently was rejected for the first time ever.

I'm New to this whole thing. I'm curious if there are any others like me.,"Hello, humans of Reddit.  I recently discovered asexuality, and subsequently the spectrum associated with it.  I've found that gray asexuality describes me disturbingly well, I honestly just thought something was wrong with me until I found it.  I've only had two crushes in my life, the first was based purely on personality (no physical attraction whatsoever) and the second was both (and what I thought was MAYBE sexual attraction, and it freaked me the fuck out).  I don't find strangers attractive in any way but ""hey you look nice, maybe cuddle me.""  I've never seen a stranger and been like, ""plz peen in the vageen now,"" nor like that with any celebrities.  weirded me out.  

But here's my strange part, I'm not repulsed by the idea of sex, in fact, I'd be really down to have it, it's something I'd want in a relationship.  I just don't experience sexual attraction like, ever.  I'd be down to cuddle, kiss, or hold hands with plenty of people, but there are almost no people I'e met that I'd wanna sleep with.

I feel a constant need to cuddle. Anyone else feel this way?,"Hey guys. I kinda had no clue where to post this. I think it does involve my asexuality a bit, and I'm scared of incurring the wrath of those outside of the asexual circle.

Anyway, I'm in a relationship of 5 and a half years with a guy I love immensely. Things sound good right? Well, except I feel a crazy, constant desire to cuddle or give/receive affection. I mean damn near CONSTANT. I sometimes feel really upset (unreasonably, imo) when I can't or it has to stop. My boyfriend isn't really a cuddler to begin with, which makes it a little difficult. I find that as we've gotten more comfortable over time, he's become even less physically intimate with me overall. He gives me hugs and quick kisses, but he rarely shows interest in any kind of prolonged physical intimacy (cuddling, making out, pillow talk, etc). Affection is something of a security for me (I received it a lot in my early childhood), and it really helps me feel like I've established a safe, secure connection. If I'm stressed, having really intense anxiety or depression, cuddling soothes me so much more than anything else. I experience all of the above on an almost daily basis, so in a way, affection is very addictive for me.

He's a low-libido sexual person who doesn't prioritize sex. We don't have it at all. I'm a sex-repulsed ace, so I sometimes feel like the drive that would typically be allotted towards sex is being overcompensated by cuddling. I guess I frequently worry that because of his consistently lowered libido, that his affection lowers with it.

I wouldn't call him neglectful. We do spend time together, and he's trying his best. Recently, he's tried involving me in his interests; he'd rather spend time together if we're doing something he wants to do and he sometimes is able to pique my interest in things. I try to be flexible and give things a try. He just built me a really nice PC, which opens up my gaming horizon and has set it up so that we're able to sit in close proximity with one another. It's been okay, better than feeling distant from him. But unfortunately, sitting next to him or trying to play League with him really isn't satisfying the desire for affection from him. 

Can't decide if I'm just crazy needy and not appreciating what I get, or if there really is something missing.

You ever feel like your sexuality has put you in an emotional hostage situation? (Can't sleep),"I've been comfortably ace for a few years now.  I've accepted it and I honestly don't even really think about it until love and relationships are brought up.  I've never actually been in a relationship, despite being the source of advice for a lot of my friends when it comes to that sort of thing.  My mind is usually on things my brain deems more important like getting my degree or just enjoying a good game.  I actually joke with my friends all the time that I don't understand how they even find the time for a relationship when I can barely find time for myself.  

But then, sometimes, I'm confronted with what I am and my anxiety will sometimes start sending me spiraling.

Here the thing : I'm not ashamed to be ace and I'm just happy that there's even a word out there that describes the way I feel.  I know there's nothing inherently wrong with it.  I'm not even really that repulsed by sex itself.  Hell, I'm an artist that gets a kick out of fetishes.  But the very idea of someone touching ME specifically like that makes my skin crawl and my gut twist and curdle.  It's so difficult to describe to some people that, yes, I may be a virgin, but I do know that I do NOT want someone's hands on certain parts of me, let alone other things.  But then I keep thinking about what it would even mean to be in a relationship.  I don't know if I'd consider myself an aro ace or panro because I'm very open to the idea of being with somebody, but I've never met anyone that I felt the particular desire to be that way with.  There were a couple times I think I might have gotten some semblance of a 'crush' and it was usually with someone I was close friends with, regardless of gender.  Though it never actually came to anything.  So demiromantic?

Either way, the classification doesn't even really matter here.  The point is that my mind forces me to confront the idea of relationships and I honestly get scared and suddenly feel like I'm in what I can only describe as an emotional hostage situation.  Like I have four options, and the only one that looks even vaguely hopeful still just feels like a hopeless fairy tale.

Option 1: I find that magical unicorn of an ace that I not only want to be more than friends with, but they also feel the same way about me, and they happen to live in the same area I'm in, and I don't have to worry about the sex.

Option 2 : I try to open myself to a relationship with a sexual person and go through with something I don't want to do to satisfy their needs in hopes that I can make it work.

Option 3 : Same as above, but instead I confront the idea of them getting satisfaction from someone else and powering through my trust issues to try and make it work.

or Option 4 : I remain alone and just sort of try to find some way not to let that fact make me feel miserable while never quite knowing what it feels like to be romantically happy.

Am I the only one that ever feels this way?  Any advice on how to cope with it?  Any advice for a maybe aro/ maybe demiro ace?",Asexual

She's struggling to come to terms with the fact that she may be asexual.

&gt; Hey, I just spent a while reading about asexuality and found a forum specifically for relationships between someone sexual and asexual. In all honesty it put my mind at ease about the past and my anxieties. I was worried that I wasn't good enough for you and always tried to be better. That resulted in some pressures that probably made you a bit uncomfortable. I learned a little more about what might be comfortable for you and what might not be. Honestly I love you to the point where I would live completely without sex for you. If it made you uncomfortable I'd go on without kissing you. If you like cuddling, which you said you would miss, I love it. The bottom line here is that I feel like our love is strong enough to overcome this. I just need you to be more open about what your needs and desires are so I could be better to you. You might not know what that is yet and you might need some time to figure it out, which is okay. I wouldn't ever judge you for how you felt, even if I may not fully understand how you feel. I know that your upcoming schedule leaves you with little to no time and that's okay. You said it yourself life strikes; I just hope that you'd be as willing to try this as I am, maybe when you have more time if that's what you feel you'll need. I know this is kind of a lot to just drop on you and that you're busy. So please take your time to consider, just know that I'll be here for you no matter what.

Are there any asexuals out there who have had porn-addictions?,"I am technically asexual but sex-positive and sometimes experience arousal, though never sexual attraction. 

When I was a young teen and first discovered that I could experience arousal, I developed an addiction to porn. It was intense and short-lived, I think the novelty aroused me (arousal addiction), but the fact that I don't experience sexual attraction soon made it boring to me. I dropped my porn habit in my late teens, and I don't react to porn anymore, but for a while, even though it didn't arouse me anymore, I did compuslively seek it out. I don't have an aversion but it simply doesn't speak to me. I have wondered if I was just desensitized, but does that negate my asexuality?

Does anyone else have a similar experience? The porn stint confused me, and meant I was in my mid 20s when I really understood I was never going to experience sexual attraction.

I've never enjoyed intercourse or oral sex,"This will be a very brief post and I'm sorry if I'm not reaching out to the right community.  I figured I'd post here because I *think* there may be varying degrees of asexuality?  Please correct me if I'm wrong though or point me to any helpful links in the sidebar that I so lazily haven't checked out yet.

Anywho, I've been with 15 different men in my lifetime, and have had intercourse with 14 of them.  There hasn't been a single time that I've enjoyed intercourse.  I also have never been able to orgasm when a guy has gone down on me.  I discovered when I was 25 that I could achieve orgasm with a vibrator.  I do get aroused by kissing and lots of touching/foreplay.  

But actual penis-in-vagina intercourse, as well as oral sex has never really done anything for me.  It's really frustrating because I feel... well, different from other women.  And to top it off, I'm also childfree, prefer to live on my own, and deal with anxiety from time to time.  So it's hard enough as it is opening up to someone (no pun intended).

I guess what I'm looking for today is advice, suggestions, and hopefully someone I can relate to.

Scared,"Im very confused right now actually. So I have always been turned on by seemingly non sexual things, but actual sex is a turn off for me. I can't bring myself to be sexually attracted to other people for the purpose of having sex with them. Its very strange.

I have always heard that  sex is a key part of a relationship, and for some reason I can't stand the idea of an open relationship. What do I do? Really up to this point I have just befriended as many girls as possible and made an emotional bond with them as best as I could, but its still not enough.

Is this a form of asexuality or am I just sexually repressed?,"I grew up in a very backwards culture that is about as backwards about sexuality as one can be (especially to us women). I have always maintained very liberal views since I was very young. But I'm not sure I have managed to avoid the cultural pressure to avoid looking at people sexually. Although I'm not sure whether that is even possible??

I have never really found any body sexually appealing. I have heard people throughout school talking about attractive men/women. I know I am attracted to men, but it's always through personality. I do have sexual urges. I just don't find the human body appealing or a turn-on in any way.

I was a 'late-bloomer' when it came to finding men attractive/a boyfriend. When I'm with my bf, I tend to use my imagination a lot.

I also don't talk about my sexuality (or lack thereof) or ""come out"" often. I assume most ppl assume I'm asexual as anyone who knows me knows I'm pretty independent. If ppl ask why I don't seem to pursue romantic relationships often I chalk it up to extreme pickiness, inability to compromise and my independence, if they ask again or ask about lack of having sex, I then explain I don't care about sex and am asexual.

A confession of a deeply tormented man,"
I have a major confession I need to air. For the past few years I have been suffering a very deep seated depression. I have been lying to myself for years trying to hide it, trying to suppress it. I have only recent come to realise a few things.

One, I am a romantic Asexual. This means I actually have little to no interest in sex or sexual relations. It doesn't mean that I can't love or be loved, just I don't care for sex. It has taken me years of failed relationships to recognise this fully.

Two: I have on multiple occasions seriously considered suicide and have come close to doing it. This is in a large part to being a closeted ACE. I've always though there was something wrong with me because I just never enjoyed sex. 

Three: As a consequence of my deep depression I have been very distant and pushed away many people that care about me. I do not know how to move forward from this. I hide behind a mask of humor and I know it's not healthy. ",Asexual

Sex In Movies (Discussion),"I'm repulsed to see it in a movie I'm watching. Nothing takes me out of the experience quicker than to suddenly have two or more characters out of nowhere bang. Like,  where did this come from? There's a monster looking for you people,  and you want to bang right now? It's pretty irritating! 

 I mean, I know why the sex is on screen (for some people,  it keeps them engaged with the show), but I just don't want to see that at all when I'm watching a film. My personal thought is that if there is more than a few sex scenes in a show or movie,  then your main plot isn't good enough to stand on its own. It's why I couldn't get into shows like GOT. To me,  there was way too much going on in the first two episodes and I couldn't do it, which sucks because I've heard it's a good show. Kudos to those who can sit through that and still enjoy it. You have something I don't have.

I'm general,  if you HAVE to keep people engaged with rape or casual sex every single episode or more than once in a movie, then maybe your story wasn't too interesting to begin with. Also, it's essentially watered-down porn. If I wanted to look at sex,  I would look at porn.  I want my movie interests and sex as far away as possible.

"Welp, came out of the closet so to speak","I've know I was asexual for awhile. I studied the topic because while its not a necessarily bad thing its different and not something present in my life growing up. Add to that that my mom is from a generation where its not a term she ever heard. With that in mind, I've never had the courage to broach the subject because while we have intellectual conversations all the time, I've never made it personal.

So, as a test run, I decided to reveal my asexuality to one of my close friends, W. Its important to state that W is a black gay man who sometimes rocks drag like no other. His father just walked out of his life when he revealed he was gay and its always been a sore spot. As much as I love him, I really was afraid that he would laugh at me or otherwise ridicule me if I said I was asexual and if he did I just assumed he would not be a person I wanted in my life. I went into this reveal with nothing but terror in my heart because he was someone I honestly didn't want to lose. I've spoken about asexuality from an academic standpoint to a few casual acquaintences I have who are members of the LGBT persuasion and the responses haven't always been favorable but often turn mocking or dismissive. 

Alas, I digress. W and I sit in his living room. I let him control the conversation and he's talking about his dogs, his recent college course he picked up. He's thinking I just wanted to get out of the house for a bit and honestly, I was chickening out with every word he said. So I stopped him and blurted out in the most undignified way, ""I'm asexual."" And that was it. I started crying. I was so stressed, already regretting the decision to tell him. We've been through a lot and his was a friendship I didn't want to lose. I wanted to take it back. And then, this bastard just finishes up what he was saying before I blurted out my confession. 

I was so shocked and looked up at him and he's leaning back into the couch just watching me. And then he smiled, told me that he didn't care. That it meant nothing to him if I was gay/straight/asexual/bisexual or interested in balloon animals. I stood by him when he came out of the closet, I stood by him when he started diving into drag and I was always a phone call away when he needed me so why would my sexuality matter at all to him. 

It was everything  I needed to hear and actually has given me the courage to maybe bring it up to my mom. Not that I'm afraid I'll lose her but its just awkward for me to broach any subject personally connected to me.",Asexual

Allosexuals and the split attraction model,"I had a new experience yesterday in that I met someone who in person, to my face, told me that they had a ""beef"" with the split attraction model.

I was a little displeased with the venue, we were both, with several others, leading a discussion on Queer Issues at a summer camp.  There are some ace questioning campers who were in the room and the kids were solid allies referencing the split attraction model.  I, and the other ace staff member, explained it so everyone in the room knew what it was about.  It was chill, until this other human had a ""beef.""

What they said was that they felt it was attacking people like them because it made it sound like pan or other queer people who are not ace just want sex which falls into stereotypes straight people perpetuate about them.

My response was without the split attraction model, there is no explanation for my own personal experience and the movement to get rid of it erases me.  I was trying to diplomatic because, again, in front of kids, I noted that maybe in the future there would be better words that make everyone happy.  I also further noted that this applies to everyone, it is just if they are pansexual, they are also panromantic and that's cool for them.

So, what do you all think?  Do you think this is just allos trying to keep aces out of their club or is there something real there?  Is there a better way I could have handled it?

My thoughts always swung between ""I've had some girl crushes before"" and ""but I can't imagine sex with a woman to be pleasurable so maybe I just *really* like them as friends?"" and ended with thinking that it doesn't matter anyway since I'm in a straight relationship. Until I just now connected the dots in my head - *of course* I wouldn't find sex with a woman pleasurable. I'm *ace*, and I've known that for at least a year now. Lol. This is so stupidly obvious now. I just never realised how little sense my thought process made because since I always knew I could love men, I never thought about whether I'd like sex with them and what that tells me about my feelings for them.

"Have sexual attraction and sex drive, but no desire to involve others","I've got a somewhat unique situation, and I'm not sure how well it falls under the asexual umbrella. I'm curious if anyone else here has a similar feeling.

I am a 32yo man, who can get turned on by seeing a cute girl, and who masturbates daily (mostly to help with falling asleep, partially for the pleasure).  I collect and view pornographic materials like many generic allosexual guys. I get annoyed at how hypersexualized society and most allosexual folk are, but I don't consider myself sexually-repulsed.

My issue is that I find the idea of involving others in sex to be... weird and insulting.  Like, I figure most allosexual folk would consider actual sex to be the end goal, and masturbation to be a sort of inferior version, but it is sort of reversed for me.  Masturbation is the natural way to resolve this physical urge, and sex with others is like a weird kink or fetish.  I feel like masturbating is like blowing my nose or urinating. It's a natural bodily process that produces bodily fluids, and like any other such activity it makes sense to be handled personally in private.

I find the idea of sex with others to just feel crass. Like, it takes somebody you presumably love and care for, and turns them into a sex toy. Instead of being my loving girlfriend, I am turning you into a walking Fleshlight. Instead of being my loving boyfriend, I am turning you into a talking dildo. You become an object for dumping disgusting fluids into. It horrifies me, and it weird me out when talking to friends in relationships, realizing that they presumably routinely get involved in these sorts of disgusting rituals with someone who they love.

It really is just like... instead of blowing your nose into a tissue when you get the urge, you go and grab your partner and blow your nose into their ear... or their mouth... or whatever random 'hole' you find pleasure in. And it just seems so weird and creepy. Like, I can take care of that myself. I don't need to degrade someone by doing bizarre things to their body.

I don't know what to call this at all. I used to think I was asexual, then I considered more obscure concepts like autochorissexuality, but even that one is more about disconnecting oneself from sex, rather than disconnecting a partner from sex.  So now I just consider myself gray-asexual of some sort, since I know that I have a lower libido and have no problem with permanently abstaining from sex with others.

I'm getting bored with masturbation.,"Okay, story time.

So I've known that I'm asexual for a while now. Maybe two years; I can't really remember. I used to not masturbate at all. I found the thought utterly repulsive, and I didn't even know what I would do it to anyway. 

But about ~8 months ago I decided to try it out. Of course, I didn't have anything to masturbate to, so I just kinda did it until it worked. I'm sparing you the details, but you get the idea. 

That one time seemed to spark something in me, because I've had an insanely high libido since. It really bothered me, because release was the only way to quell it. 

I started doing it about once a week, and then several times a week, and around May every day. 

I never used porn or anything, but I did start to create fantasies to do it to. However, they never involved sex, just me touching someone else. (Well it's a little more complicated than that. I don't appear in the fantasies that often myself, it's just imagining another person). 

I understand that probably doesn't make much sense, but actual porn/images still disgust me. I guess imagining touching is enough for me. Anyway that's besides the point!

The point is that masturbation is really boring to me now. I feel like I might as well be back to months ago when I had nothing to satisfy my libido. I find it hard to get turned on, and when I do it hardly feels good.

Thanks for hearing me out. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I just wish I had a way to satisfy my libido.

Feeling Frustrated,"Kinda Long Rant/Vent Below:

Okay so, I've slowly come to the realization that *me* as a person has not really changed other than worldview and life experience since I was about 10 or 12 years old. When I sit down and peel away all the labels myself and other people have put on me, I still see that same person staring back at me as I saw over a decade ago.

When I was 14 I was questioning my sexuality. I didn't get ""turned on,"" I wasn't interested in the concept of being in a relationship. I wasn't experiencing any of the things my parents and teachers told me were part of going through puberty. Classic asexual story, right? Fast forward a few months and I came out to my dad, not as an asexual but just trying to figure out my identity (still didn't know asexual was the right word or that there were other people like me). He took it well and said there was some label but he couldn't remember it. I eventually figured it out and felt a huge relief at knowing I wasn't alone. Having something to label myself with.

Flash forward to a few months ago, one of my friends came out to me as trans. We talked about it for a while and he told me something that utterly blew my mind: That sexuality and gender identity aren't one and the same. I spent the last few months considering what my gender identity really was. It wasn't something I had thought about before my friend came out to me, but suddenly I started to realize that labeling myself as female really had never felt right. I finally figured out I'm genderfluid. Again I felt great relief in knowing I wasn't the only one and knowing I had something to label myself with.

But lately, I've felt frustrated with all these labels. I sat down yesterday and thought about all the labels I have for myself now. Otherkin, Asexual, Demiromantic, Genderfluid. Just to name the more controversial ones. When I look back on 12-year-old me I realize that I'm *still* the *same* person, but I no longer feel so comfortable with myself because of labeling myself. Even though I like being able to put a positive ID marker on all these things that make me, me, I just wish I could go back to a time when none of it mattered. When I was just me, and that was enough.

I guess this was just a rant. I needed to vent to some folks who understand where I'm coming from. I'm blessed to have two friends who are asexual as well but we rarely feel free to talk about being aces as we're all (except for me with my dad) still in the closet and rarely hang out out of earshot of *someone's* family.

Thanks for reading.",Asexual
Asexual Erasure,"So I haven't really experienced ace erasure too much as someone in a loving relationship with a guy as a biromantic grey ace female. But someone just responded to a comment I made about being asexual and it being a valid identity with the following.

""If your existence depended on asexuality then please do explain, last time i checked someone who doesn't experience sexual feelings can't reproduce anyway, sorry bud you were created during sexual intercourse between a male and a women. Like someone else on this thread already said, you don't need to have to add a new letter on the acronym LGBT for every single instance when someone isn't considered to be straight. I actually respected the LGBT community but now they just seem to keep pushing the lines of reality more and more. Im sorry but you aren't asexual, as someone already said. You are just happy to be alone, and I'm perfectly ok with that.﻿""

What's the difference?,"I honestly didn't intend the title to be any sort of clickbait, but I have several questions and I wanted the title to be concise.

So, here goes. I think I'm asexual, but I also think I might just be repressing my sexuality. This is (probably?) because (and thank god for anonymity so I can say this) I am transgender. I feel sick thinking about sex—I'm not attracted to men sexually, and the thought of having sex with a woman makes me physically ill. The thing is, I'm not sure if that's because I'm repressing being a lesbian out of guilt (appropriating the way ""real"", cis lesbians feel, or something like that). Does that sound at all plausible, or do I probably have an aversion to sexuality with regards to women in general?

The sort of relationship I would want is basically what people would call ""platonic"", I think. Cohabitation is very important to me. I would want to adopt and raise children, and be close to all family members. Sleeping together; hugging; snuggling; cooking, playing video games, and shopping together; etc. are all things I would like. I would want a man to hold me and make me feel safe, and I would want a woman to help me feel beautiful.

From what I've read, asexuality doesn't necessarily exclude the presence of a libido. I think I do have one, but it makes me feel nauseated. I despise the feeling to my utmost, and am hoping to have an orchiectomy at some point in the near future. At the same time, I do have one. I feel like that might indicate that I'm not asexual?

I want to live with and have a very close, non-sexual relationship with a ""best of best friends"". Is this romantic, or am I just being stupid?",Asexual
Advice?,"I don't know where to start. I'm a 16 year old guy, and I've always been attracted to girls in some capacity, but I've never seemed to crave any sort of physical intimacy more than kissing and cuddling. Sex has just always seemed clinical and factual to me. I just got out of my first intimate relationship where I got to 3rd base and since then I've been filled with regret, and shame that I did stuff like that just to make her happy, when I was uncomfortable with the idea the whole time. I've thought before that I might've been asexual, and was rather convinced that I was, and so about 2 years ago, I told my parents that I thought I was asexual, and I was promptly told no, and that I was trying to be different. Since then I tried ignoring it and not thinking about it, hoping something would change. For someone who is tall and moderately muscular, I feel like I'm supposed to fit some dominant, super masculine persona. And it's just so hard, because I want to look more androgynous, and be with a girl who isn't sexually inclined and is more dominant. I'm sorry to derail the post with tangential stuff, but I feel like I'm surrounded by friends who won't understand and that I can't really explain to.

Coming out to Family,"The reviews for sharing your asexuality, especially with family, seem to be mixed around here. 

I felt the need to come out to my family this past week, and my experience was very good, so I want to share it here. Part of my reasoning was that my dad would often make insensitive remarks that he didn't know would bother me. Sadly, it's part of his vernacular, but he's trying to minimize it now. I told my mom and my brother a few weeks ago and they'd been trying to quiet those kinds of remarks, but it wasn't quite enough and I found myself avoiding being around my family.

A couple of days ago I pulled my dad aside, told him not to share what I was about to say to the rest of the family, and explained the situation as well as I could. He had questions, as I expected, but he was immediately apologetic for the way he'd been speaking. He was happy to try to be more sensitive and asked that I let him know when he said something that bothered me. Since then, he's been really receptive to feedback and I feel a lot more comfortable at home.

I guess the bottom line is that the people around you might not need to know about your sexuality,  but if they are doing things that make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, it might be best for you that they know. I won't guarantee it for every family, but I imagine that most care a lot more about making a sibling or child happy than they have some cultural insensitivity toward people of a differing sexual orientation. I'm very happy that I said something.

Am I among you folks?,"I'd hate this to be the run-of-the-mill, ""Am I asexual?"" post, but I feel like I need your opinions more than ever. With that being said, here goes:

I'm 16/m, and from ages 10-16, I'd typically refer to myself as heterosexual. All my crushes were female, and I've masturbated to straight porn. That was until I found out I had a humiliation fetish. Now every time I fantasize, it is almost always about humiliation in some way or another. I watched BDSM, foot worship, and sissy hypno to name a few. When I would watch things from these genres, I was usually less aroused by the people in the videos, and more aroused by the sheer act of being humiliated. It is almost like humiliation *is* my sexuality now. I don't really even care if it's a woman/man/transsexual in these flicks.

Flashback a few months ago I had my first kiss with a woman. It was okay, but I didn't really cherish it (maybe it was the girl). After that, I kissed another girl, and it felt better, but it didn't really intrigue me as much as I had hoped.

Right now, I'm practicing the power of self-discipline and am abstaining from masturbation and porn for as long as I can. I want to see if what's going on is just some porn-induced fetish, or a characteristic of my sexuality. I also want so try out dating some more people to see if physical contact is for me.

Asexual but wish I had a sex drive?,"Hey guys! I'm new to this subreddit, and have really enjoyed looking through the posts here and can relate to a lot of you. I'm a biromantic asexual. I have next to no sex drive. Very rarely, like once a month, I get sorta turned on, but even then I don't want intercourse. It just doesn't sound pleasant or satisfying, even when I'm horny. I've been in some pseudo-relationships but my asexuality has made it hard to have a real relationship, as everyone I have been with is sexually active and I can't give them what they need.

I'm not sex repulsed, and I don't think my asexuality is a result of childhood trauma. I had an abusive stepfather for some time but it wasn't sexual abuse at all, and I count myself as being very much healed from those years. I really wish I wanted sex. I used to have a moderate sex drive in my early teens but I never had sex then, and by age 17 or so I was asexual. I'm in my early 20s now, and in a time in life where sexuality is important to partners.

Do you think I can gain a sex drive? I know you guys aren't doctors, but is there a medicine or some sort of therapy that I can receive to have some sort of sexual desires? Having a relationship and being able to satisfy a partner (and myself, honestly, I very rarely am able to masturbate and have never orgasmed) is very important to me, and my asexuality is a source of stress for me. I hope I'm not offending anyone by not wanting to be asexual, I don't think asexual people are broken or that asexuality is bad at all. Just, personally, I feel like I'm missing out on a large part of life that so many people really enjoy.",Asexual
What 'makes you' asexual? Do you have a particular explanation for being on the ace spectrum or are you just not into it?,"Just wondering because sometimes I just find my asexuality really upsetting, particularly because of the place it comes from and what it's directed toward. I wouldn't say I'm in any way repulsed by sex. I'm a girl in my late teens, I masturbate when I feel the need to, I am aesthetically to both guys and girls and do find intrigue in things like dicks and fannies and the like, but the idea of me having sex and losing my virginity has on multiple occasions brought me to tears. I don't associate sex with love at all, and something about how *human* it is in this unrefined way fills me with a sort of panic, especially when I see how much of this uncontrolled *want* is involved. I've heard it described as something like a biological need, like how we don't really think about needing to eat, we just seek food out automatically, but that just makes it scarier since I am a bit of a disordered eater so the consumption of food is very deliberate. The idea of biological needs as humans is a bit soul crushing if you think about it too much, and although I obviously cannot do absolute shit about it, I blatantly reject a lot of ""standard"" traits of being human. A good lot of people I know have no issue with saying ""oh I'm just irritated because of my hormones"" and I get upset when someone says I'm hormonal, for reasons unknown to me. When a pregnant woman is acting emotional, it makes me anxious, ironically not because any lack of knowledge of what is going on in her body but because I do know. I know it sounds so odd to be so keen on rejecting your very existence, but that's one of the primary things that creates my aversion for sex. It's like once you lose your virginity, you will likely seek out further sexual encounters for whatever reason (although I know not everyone does), and I associate that with losing a certain degree of clarity (although again, I know that's bullshit) that is similar to what is often associated with growing up and losing your wonder, if that makes any sense. Now I expect that most of you will think that I sound absolutely bonkers (to be fair, I have other 'reasons' as well that I didn't touch upon), and that is fair enough, but I thought it might be cool if we all just shared our point of view toward sex in our asexuality.

The Jughead reboot is possibly being cancelled. :(,"The 2015 Jughead comics reboot revealed the title character to be asexual a few years ago.

Based on the fan reaction to the TV adaptation, Riverdale, in which his asexuality is totally ignored and he ends up in a relationship with Betty which is ludicrously popular among fans, it's clear that people don't want an asexual Jughead. If the series comes back, he most likely won't be asexual. This was basically proof that asexual characters don't bring in money.

I know it's not something to be devastated about, but. I'm devastated. I know that there's other media with asexual characters, but the only two fictional characters I feel like I can really relate to are Jughead and Todd from Bojack Horseman.

Does this count as sexual attraction?,"(I posted this on r/asexuality but just got one reply)

I think I'm graysexual but I'm not sure.I experience what I think it's sexual attraction pretty rarely (genital arousal + pleasurable and spontaneous thoughts about having sex with an specific person).But there are similar feelings that I experience more often and I don't know if they count as sexual attraction.

When I feel attracted to someone in a aesthetic/sensual way (or sometimes in a romantic way too),I often feel genitally aroused but I don't have any sexual thoughts about the person or any interest in any sexual contact (and if I try to picture myself having sex with them,I either become repulsed or remain indifferent).

It's just a physical sensation that feels disconnected from my brain/thoughts,like  some automatic body response,but clearly directed at that attractive person.

Also,I don't think sex is that important in my relationships,and when I'm single I absolutely don't need it or crave it AT ALL.

"Aspec Representation ""Masterpost""","I'll edit this with anything else that's commented!  Also of note is that a number of these examples also include gay/bi characters (The Foxhole Court) *and*/or trans characters (Nicoserial, Every Heart a Doorway)

**Nicoserial**: [Nicoserial](https://nicoserial.blogspot.com) is a mixed media site of written word with accompanying illustrations that will be updating weekly beginning in August; till now, it has been updating three weeks a month.  The author is aromantic and asexual, so you can go into this knowing that the asexual characters will be handled with care.  There's a mix of genres here, so if none of the stories strike your fancy, one in another style might pop up in a few months.  Please do note that I'd only recommend reading after bracing yourself for the worst, as even the most lighthearted story so far has ended up getting dark at times.

**Bojack Horseman**: Bojack Horseman is an adult cartoon available on Netflix.  It hinges on subverting the sitcom genre with an existential tone and bleak humor.  It also has a very natural reveal towards the end of the third season that an established and well-loved main character is asexual, calling himself 'not gay, but not straight either.  Nothing.'

**Archie Comics**: Everyone knows that Jughead in the new Archie Comics is asexual.  I can't really elaborate further on this because I haven't read them yet myself, but it's there for sure; plus, he's been aromantically coded since way back, often stating he was married to food.

**The Foxhole Court**: [The Foxhole Court](https://www.amazon.com/Nora-Sakavic/e/B00J23NV3E) by Nora Sakavic happens to have a protagonist who is demisexual, which many consider to be on the asexual spectrum.  It's well-handled and coded long before it's ever stated.  Similarly to Nicoserial above, TFC goes into some incredibly sensitive topics, so again, be prepared if you do decide to read.

**TheMysteriousMrEnter**: Is it cheating to put a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMysteriousMrEnter) channel on the list?  Technically this isn't a character, but the man behind this channel is asexual, is open about it in his videos, and it quite evidently contributes to the lens through which he sees media.  Want a funny reviewer who'll be just as sex-repulsed as you may or may not be?  This is where to go for that.

**Sirens**: I don't have much info on this one, but I hear there's an ace character in the American version of the show.

**Faking It**: (s3e8), A random dude basically shouts ""I'm asexual"". Sure, it was minor, but it was said in such a ""whatever"" kind of way and was met with total and unmistakable acceptance (As commented by reddit user Palladog)

**The Movement**: Tremor/Roshanna Chatterij from DC's The Movement responds to one of her teammates hitting on her by telling him she is asexual (As commented by reddit user faihu, who states that the comic isn't very good, but the character is.)

**Every Heart a Doorway**: As reddit user CeruleanTresses says, ""I read it and it was a really beautiful story. It's a novella about a boarding school for kids who have returned from adventures in fantasy worlds and whose parents want them to be ""normal"" again, and the point-of-view character is explicitly asexual.""

Heard of a couple,"So I heard of this couple. While is is somewhat disturbing, it is also kind of sweet.

Her:
Model

Ace (not aromantic, which of course means she is struggling with her relationship ALL THE TIME)

Massive anxiety-issues with self-harm-coping mechanisms not to slide into alcoholism.


Him:
Bodybuilder

Actively sadistic (as in BDSM, not like he kicks puppies, not a socio-path)

Hormonal imbalance leaving him impotent


These two found eachother, and now have a rather odd, but fully functional physical and romantic relationship.

Pretty sweet huh?",Asexual
Thank You,"You guys are wonderful people. I've been fighting a lot of battles, between overworked... Dealing with feeling sick to my stomach over a friend's decisions and path they are taking... Fighting my dysphoria, my depression, my anxiety... 

But having a group of people being so wonderful, caring, and supportive... I never expected the love that I have gotten from this subreddit and now I never want to stop posting and talking to you guys... Selfish like that I am.

I wake up every day just wanting to die, the pain of facing another day to just go away, and more... But you guys make the burden of life just a little bit better &lt;3 

I've tried posting in /r/depression and more but... Either I get ignored, I get hateful PMs for being ace and trans, or unhelpful comments... Idk... It's not been a good ride. I've not been in a good place for a long while mentally. 

You guys are a different story, though... And I just wanted to let you know you are wonderful, beautiful people who deserve nothing but the best. Thank you for the wonderful advice, comments, concerned PMs, and the comments telling me that I am beautiful on the inside and that's what counts

I'm sorry I work a lot of overtime, 12 hour swingshifts and so barely have time to answer but just want you to know I read every comment and PM, I swear. I wish I could always leave a meaningful response as soon as I get it.

I hope you have a wonderful night.

A good movie without anything sexual in it?,"I just watched ""A Cure for Wellness"" night... What the actual fuck did I just watch. 

Spoiler warning for the paragraph below!




Whole movie goes by and the only real mention of sex was this baroness who married his sister for a pure bloodline. I was not expecting the end to be nearly a rape scene between the medical director and Hannah... His daughter... This movie went from a ""What's wrong wrong with this medical facility"" and good themes to a totally ""what the actual fuck is going on"" movie.

Asexual Erasure in the viral Equinox Video,"I am a proud Asexual Panromantic. I was deeply wounded when in the first 10 seconds of Equinox's otherwise beautiful and finely choreographed viral video on the LGBTQIA+ alphabet, the ""A"" was for Ally. They had 26 damn letters to find some way to work in Aces. We could at least have Demi or Gray. Instead we got Exhibitionists and Heteroflexible, who are also easily cishet, not even necessarily LGBT. 

In response I sat up and wrote an article on Asexual erasure and why we need visibility. I am proud that it was picked up and featured on the front page of Huffington Post. You can find it here:

http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59454b7be4b024b7e0df4c75

I am proud to have helped raise visibility. But I was then crushed again as several hateful comments in a thread of over 500 stated Asexuals aren't LGBT. Asexuals aren't real. Asexuals aren't welcome. Asexuals are just choosing not to have sex for attention. One 60 year old man commented unequivocally that he knows Asexuals are mentally damaged and need therapy. He will never accept us; instead, he is worried about us and will advocate to get us medical assistance. He is gay. At 60 years old, he came out in an era that saw gay men as needing conversion therapy. You would think he would know better than to force it on us.

We need to be loud, to build our own strength in community and do outreach for visibility. I hope my article reaches many Aces in need. We need it. We need it. 

Please don't let Equinox get away without even giving us acknowledgement. Go post on their wall. Tell them proudly: I am Asexual and I will not be erased!",Asexual

What am I?,"I am female and attracted to males. That I know. But I have little to no sexual desire at all. Rarely, I will enjoy passionate kissing and a little bit of fooling around, but when it becomes sexual, even just touching each other, I just don't want to do it. It feels like a chore and I'm plagued with guilt afterwards.
I had one 3 year 'relationship' (age 16-19) where sex was a massive issue - we tried a few times but each time I just seized up and panicked. He would touch me but I wouldn't really want him to and I would do things to help get him off out of 'duty'. It took its toll and eventually I couldn't even bear being cuddled and the relationship had to end.
I'm nearly 23 now and just starting to see someone new. I had put my experience down to being young and deep in an eating disorder. However, now I am a bit older and have reached a healthy weight (still in recovery) and my feelings haven't changed whatsoever. He has been very understanding as I told him I'm not really all that experienced and said that we can wait until I'm ready... but the thing is, I just don't want to. I've never had any interest in maturation and the idea of being naked with another person, completely letting go, engaging in sexual acts just makes me feel really uncomfortable.
Like I love the idea of being close to someone and being in a relationship with them, just not the intimacy. Like I even thought, I'd probably be happy in a relationship with someone I love, using sperm donation etc to have a family and trust him to be emotionally faithful while satisfying his sexual needs elsewhere. 
Does this make sense? I'm just confused really and wondering if it's just because I'm inexperienced and self conscious or if this is just me and I'll have to accept it...",Asexual
How accepted do you feel at Pride events?,I'm still new to being asexual having previously considered myself to be a straight cis ally of the LGBT community. I know aces are technically part of the community (though unfortunately some would argue this) but it still feels weird to me to consider myself part of it. I'm not sure if its because I'm still relatively new or if its because stereotypically people at Pride events tend to be more...flamboyant than aces usually present themselves. Basically what my rambling is getting at is do you feel welcome and a part of large public events like pride parades or even just the LGBT in general?,Asexual
Telling People,"My mother suspects that I am asexual, I have no intention of telling her. She heard the word in some newspaper article and thought it clicked with me. 

I know it seems like she would be accepting but my parents can be judgmental. Saying little things that they don't intend to be hurtful and are and even after I tell them don't understand how it can be hurtful. 

I have no intention of coming out to my family, they will never really understand my orientation. As long as I don't tell then I can ignore comments because they don't know the truth, if I told them then the comments would mean something and it would actually hurt.

How do you make yourself have sex / want to have sex?,"All my life, I never cared about sex at all.  I am most certainly attracted to women, but I don't care about the actual sex or sexual activities at all.  I guess the easiest way to put it is that sex related stuff is a turn off for me?  Sorry, I'm still kinda new at this.

Anyway, about a year ago I finally realized that I am, indeed, asexual.  Also, about a year ago, I got married.  Fortunately, my wife is a saint and is super understanding, but this is causing a little bit of a strain.  

I try to tell her all the time how beautiful she is and how much I love her, but I know deep down she finds it discouraging that I won't have sex with her.

"I feel upset guys don't look at me, but I can't see relationships working with my sexuality.","Hi! This is a little vent and question post about teenage dating as ace. I am almost to the ends of my teen years, but I still haven't dated/kissed ect.

I figured out my sexuality at 15, I was accepting and happy about it. Most of my friends and my mom and dad were super accepting (but a few other friends really upset me with rude remarks and gross comments about my sexuality.) so I was comfortable being ace. I was and slightly still am made uncomfortable about guys coming up to me and trying to flirt with me(I am made uncomfortable by people trying to confront me as well as being anxious and possibly having paranoid personality disorder.. Bad combination lol) although that usually wouldn't happen so I was fine.

I met someone who will go by the name of Liz. Liz is 15 (14 at the time) and looks up to me like an older sister and asked me for advise with boys and life. Since my parents have a good relationship and I've grown up with watching and thinking about media, I figured I could give her advice. It was fine until I accidentally came out as ace, as well as admitting I'd never been in a relationship. She started infantilizing me, so I figured ""hey it's fine if guys like me, maybe I can date"". 

I looked at guys to see if they would give me attention like Liz got attention and they didn't give me any. It really took a toll on my (already low) self confidence and I felt horrible about myself. 

I still feel bad that guys don't look at me like other girls, but I relize that I probably couldn't be in a relationship anyway. Considering I'm both sex and partially romance repulsed. 

Anyways, what is your opinion on asexual teens dating? I have a friend who is ace and married, but other than that all my ace friends are single like I am.",Asexual
"Unusual circumstance, can I have some advice?","I've never been attracted to a human female or male (yes I thought that maybe I was gay but the body of a man just doesn't do it for me either.)

I am also scared of touch, due to physical abuse.

I feel really weird but I guess I will say it, (regardless of the rude things I may get) I've always had attraction towards anime girls.

But it's more like an attraction to the personality of the character.

There's not much variation in age in anime but the girls are of 15+ age(I am 21 and felt like this since I was 11) and I do not like kid anime girls or ""lolis"" for those acquatied with anime terminology(I am not a  pe**, people tend to jump into this conclusion when an adult enjoys cute anime so I just needed to clarify.) 


What I want to know is:

&gt;Do I still count as asexual?
&gt; Is there a term for this circumstance in the asexual community? 

Please and thank you.


Lastly, I do not want to engage in sexual acts with anime characters and I feel weird about sexualizing them. I think the designs are beautiful but it's more about romance to me. (Please don't be too harsh on me, I don't know where else to turn.)

This is how I would explain it if ever I decide to come out,"I'm not dating so what's the point? This is my experience with asexuality.

Everyone loves doughnuts right? Full of sugar, fat and so many different flavors and they are everywhere. It's to the point that when you see said doughnut, despite the calories and the fact that it's unhealthy, you say fuck it, why not? Problem is when you bite into it, it's disappointing. I mean, sure they are tasty, but somehow it's nowhere near what other people touted it to be. That and you feel like crap after and guilty. All that and no satisfaction, not even as you ate it. How is it even worth it if you don't crave it? And yet, you keep craving the idea of the doughnut, eating them again and again thinking that even if you don't crave it, this time will be different, but it never is. So you give up, wondering who the hell you're doing this for. So you like the idea, that doesn't mean you have to eat them and it doesn't mean you can't share the joy vicariously when you see someone else enjoy a doughnut for real. ",Asexual
I hate wet dreams: Part 2,"To recap: I'm not a sexual person at all, even staying away from masturbation and porn, but my body does get aroused by certain things. I wish I could just, stop it. About a month ago, I posted about how wet dreams made me feel guilty, like I lost control over myself.  Apologize for not replying before, and for being sort of vague. 



There's a specific trigger I've identified that causes the wet dreams to happen - images of bellies on women. That's all it takes. Since I associate with plus-size models often, those images pop up really often. And if I'm checking out photographs at night or while in bed, the dreams definitely follow and -boom- I'm awake with a spot on my boxers. These women are my friends, they're incredible people, so I feel even worse. I don't even imagine having sexual contact with them in dreams - its their soft bodies alone.



I've taken steps to counter all this, though. One solution was better sleep hygiene &amp; keeping my phone away at night. Melatonin also does wonders! When working with models, I work hard to separate my body and mind - like these women have INCREDIBLE bodies aesthetically, but I would never imagine them as just bodies or sexual objects. They're people, you know? 




 I've gotten over feeling ashamed of myself because this is a natural process, but some of it definitely stems from a lack of self-care/ self-esteem. Now that I put myself first, things are better! I'm just rambling, Grew up Catholic so I don't know very much. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

Insight from Grey-sexuals and demisexuals as I'm confused.,"So hey I'm a bit confused in my situation if I am possibly gray ace, demi a combination of both maybe or none at all. Would love some insight incase any of you have experienced the feelings I am right now thanks in advance so I'll give you a rundown. 

So I'll start by saying I'm a virgin. Earlier this year I figured out and was coming to terms with the fact I might be bisexual because I've always noticed attractive guys or girls and enjoyed the eye candy but it wasn't nessisarily sexual (I learned about the different types of attraction)
so it seemed more like aesthetic attraction.

 I just find myself usually gazing and admiring not really picturing sexual thoughts with them. Although rarely I have been aroused not nessisarily for them or rarely if ever as I can't really remember to be honest. I find it's a bit hard to distinguish esthetic and sexual attraction (anyone else?). On occasion I have been turned on but not really envisioning the person that aroused me if that makes sense just like I'm now in the mood and it's a itch that needs to be scratched feeling. 

I'm not opposed to the idea of sex really I just view it in a couple different ways. A method of getting closer and forming a better bond to a partner or another method more so specifically with men like a means to enjoyment because I believe I'm a bottom if anything so the sex isn't nessisary focused on a attractive partner sure a esthetically pleasing one to look at one would be nice but just focused on a orgasm end goal.

 I also find that lets say I see a model or actress lots find attractive I will not or I will see them as average/meh like 99% of the time. (Am I just picky?) On the other hand I've seen myself have like a mutual friend that fit into the criteria that I find very attractive esthetically and as I got to know her little bit by bit over the days we hung out I grew stronger feelings for her romantic and the sorts. I feel I should add when I typically want relationships I don't really fantisize on the sexual aspects of it but the sensual aspects like wanting to cuddle, hug and just be close and share myself with mentally and emotionally.

Even recently when I told my friend that's graysexual I might be she was like ""I knew it knew it, called it lol""

M17 I feel like I don't/can't care about anyone anymore/Asexual Aromantic,"(originally posted here https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6do7fm/m17_i_feel_like_i_dontcant_care_about_anyone/ )

I feel like I used to be able to care about people, say 3 and a half years ago, but now it just feels like they're there and I'm here. It does feel like I can't do much without them too, and I do feel bad about that, especially when they ask if I love them and I'm just not able to feel anything but anxiety and guilt when I have to force a ""yeah"".

I hate being around other family members besides my mum and nan, especially when I feel forced to care about them and when I act like I don't I'm called an ""dick"" by some for trying to get them to not talk to me. I do realise about how I should care and how I should want to help my family but it just seems like they're here to help me up to a point where I don't have to contact them again because I'd 
feel bad about having to fake it.

The only person that knows about this is my mum, but she keeps saying that in the future I could be different in the future and that it's ""early days"" or some shit like that. It's probably not to get me out of thinking that my head is fucked up or that I should have never been born like I normally do think; she probably does believe it but I can't just take her word for it because of how she isn't even mildly educated on enough on mental health stuff, never mind on something this complex.

I've also got autism and I don't know if that's anything to do with it but everyone just says it's on a fucking spectrum without any fucking explanation of how that spectrum works. There's only really explanations of the most common versions of it, and no damn doctor has tried to expand on that at all. I really do doubt it is this though because I did used to be able to at least like people and be able to be friends with them then something went just went wrong along the way.

It definitely does seem like no one is actually educated on this shit, and that they think just comforting words is going to get people out of this....says the one going on the internet for comfort :/ and not expecting any solutions.
Another thing that has happened recently is that I was also put on 
Sertraline for 18 days a few months ago and it has killed my sex drive since then, so now I’m basically temporarily asexual as well as aromantic, which is a lack of romantic attraction, which I do believe I am despite of how I remember being attracted to a girl temporarily for about half a day when I was about 10 but then none of them interested me after that. I then realised I was into gay porn at 12/13, so now my sexuality is just confusing as fuck to figure out now, because who’s to say if I’ll ever feel any of these feelings again?

I do hope this isn’t forever. This better not be fucking forever.

Most people that don’t experience romantic or sexual attraction probably don’t feel “empty” but it definitely does feel like I do though.",Asexual

Confused,"Might not be the right place to post this, but it's the best sexuality I ""relate"" to right now:

No idea what I am or how to help find what I am. The only thing I know I definitely am is I am not gay. I used to have serious crushes on girls when I was in school but since then I haven't really had any. I did crush on a woman for a very brief period a while ago, and in that time I really wanted to get to know her and have sex with her but now I'm back to my ""normal"" state - I do watch straight porn and masturbate, and I do check out women on the street, but the idea of actually having sex has always been kind of off-putting to me, even though I sometimes wonder if touching a body would be nice, but never really tried it. The idea of a partner also puts me off, although sometimes I do think it would be nice if someone could cook and do my laundry for me (yeah I know). I'm also pretty much as sexually and romantically inexperienced as you can get, so I can't really think about previous experiences - Never had a girlfriend, never kissed (also offputting), could probably count the number of times I've hugged on all my fingers. Basically. if it's in any way sexual or romantic, I probably haven't done it. I don't trust any of my (few) friends or family with this kind of information so I've never spoken to anyone about it - my family has never asked or seems concerned, for friends it rarely comes up but if it does I just play along and talk about my ""experiences"", basically just saying generic shit and so far it hasn't raised any eyebrows or aroused suspicion. Obviously I don't pretend I'm sleeping with someone else every other day, but I just put myself a bit below average and everyone seems to believe it. I'm not really weird per se socially, and I wouldn't consider myself unattractive, so what I am saying to them is probably feasible.

[35F] Could I be asexual?,"I find people attractive. I don't know if it's sexual attraction. It feels like I want to be around them and get to know them. I wouldn't call it a physical sensation. Sex is just something I've always been expected to do, and I pretty much just think about how badly I wish I were doing anything else and wanting it to be over with. I don't believe I'm capable of orgasm. It feels good overall when I have sex, but I'd still rather be done. Do asexuals feel pleasure during sex? However, if it's someone that I love, I really enjoy pleasing them and then sexual acts are more of a thing I want to do to make them feel good, which I guess is the confusing part. I've never enjoyed sex much and always thought it was for some reason or another...that I was gay, hadn't met the right person, etc...and now, a considerably high number of sex partners later and it's still just a thing I do because people expect me to. I keep waiting for it to get good and I just don't know if that's going to happen. Also, I don't know if it matters, but I have a strong desire to feel wanted and intimate, I'm just not sure I actually want to have sex at all. ",Asexual

"[22, F] I'm confused, but my guy friend is like 99% sure I'm asexual. Help me?","TL;DR I don't really enjoy sex, but I had it because I got raped and that's part of how I dealt with it, although I wasn't interested before. And now I'm wondering if I'm just fucked up from trauma or asexual?

So, in high school, I was pretty disinterested in the whole dating/sex thing. Both porn and masturbation seemed foul and I wasn't even remotely curious. However, I was attracted to guys.
Then, junior year I got raped at school, and my way of dealing with it, was trying to repeat the act to change the memory...also, I figured I was already dirty anyway, what was the harm? 
After months of trauma therapy, I decided that it only made me feel dirtier to do stuff and that I wanted to ""reclaim my virginity."" Well, I later started dating a guy, and long story short, I got raped again because I completely shutdown when he got violent. This time it resulted in not wanting people to touch me, period. 
Fast forward to my second week of college, and I went to a frat party (my first time going out ever). I hated it because EVERYONE invades your space. Despite being sober, I got raped again, among other dehumanizing things the guy did to me after smothering me with a pillow to get me to stop fighting, and then I just kind of let everything happen (maybe that isn't rape then, idk--is it rape if you give in? I think it is. Maybe not?). Anyway, I resumed my ""don't touch me"" phase until I met a nice guy, who I let have sex with me. TBH I don't remember it, but I wasn't particularly encouraged to engage in it again. 
But from then on, if I'm dating someone, I let it happen after awhile, just because, well, fighting it never works out too well--I get drunk or high to get through it, it helps me escape. But anyway, lately I've been doing me and looking back, I don't enjoy it--I mean, I can get off from oral, but I have to pretend there isn't another person there and that I'm just experiencing a sensation, like I really have to focus only on the sensation (it's kind of exhausting). Also, sex has always hurt and like, l literally will never understand why people like it. 
Sooooooo, am I just a fucked up heterosexual person or am I asexual? I should also probably mention that I don't want to have sex again, although I do sometimes experience arousal (if I'm with someone and something could actually happen, even if I'm turned on I still don't want to do anything), and I also kinda don't even want to date or be with anyone, but that may be because I don't think I can be with someone without sex being involved. To further confuse matters, I also am sometimes attracted to women, but I don't want to have sex with them either. 
Also as a final note, I just graduated from college and finally talked about my rape freshman year, so I have just restarted trauma therapy &amp; I've tried to talk about this with my therapist but she doesn't seem to get it. She's like you can do whatever you want--get married if you want to get married--and I'm over here like, uh, sure, BUT IM CONFUSED. 
So, my guy friend thinks I'm asexual &amp; I'm starting to think I might be--what do you think?

[20 M] Confused,"So I think I'm asexual and decided to stick with the label last Thursday. A little backstory: I've always been a late bloomer with girls. My first crush was in 7th grade and I went on my first date when I was 19. I also lost my virginity and had my first kiss when I was 19 (different girl from the one I dated.) However, I hated having sex and kissing, so I haven't done that since then or had any interest in either of those activities. Dating I liked enough to try again, and both of the dates I went on during that time period were just platonic it seemed. No physical contact was exchanged. And that threw me off, like isn't dating supposed to be romantic and flirty? It felt like they were just normal female friends. 

Anyways, the reason I decided that I was asexual was because I have never had sexual urges before about another person, but I do on my own, just to masturbate. I never feel the need to touch someone or have someone help me get off. Also, I don't like sex, so that seemed to me that I was textbook asexual. 

Last Friday, the day after I came out so to speak, I had a school dance that I invited my friend to. She's cute, but I'm not into her that way, I just see her as a friend. But when I was around her, I felt really aroused and I couldn't control it. Not in the sense that I was thinking about her or sex at all, but physically speaking. So that's where I'm at. I just don't know what to think of everything, it is so confusing. Anyone got any experiences to share or advice?
Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: I also feel like I'm missing out on a lot of the adventure and good times my friends have, but what my body wants is to not go out and have sexual experiences at all.",Asexual

Would I be considered asexual?,"I've always referred to myself as bi because I do find both men and women attractive and have dated both in the past. I'm a virgin (only just turned 18) and even though I masturbate often the actual idea of having sex kind of disgusts me. It sounds overrated and unclean. I can't get off if I imagine things being done to me or doing things to someone else, I'm only aroused at the thought of watching others going at it with each other.

Is love something I can have?,"I've had 4 boyfriends in my life, and the relationships all ended because I had zero interest in sex and they were unsatisfied.  It's been about 10 years since I've dated anyone now. I've just felt that I don't ever want to have sex ever again, so how can I ever ask someone to sacrifice that for me?

It makes me sad sometimes. I do want romance. I'd be comfortable cuddling on the couch to watch movies, I'd like to hold hands, to have someone to hug and to hold me when I'm sad. I might even be able to kiss, if I feel really comfortable with the person. But I can't ever, and don't ever want to have sex. 

It's not like people are knocking down doors to ask me out, I'm no beauty, but the few times someone has shown interest I've been quick to shoot them down, because I'm afraid of leading them on.

There is a guy I like. He is smart, and funny, and kind. But also I know he is very sexual. He'd never be happy with me. For almost 10 years I've been content being single, but since I've met him I'm starting to feel loneliness more and more keenly.  I find that I do want someone to hold, to touch, to be close to both emotionally and physically. But I'll never want anything more sexual than kissing.

How common is it for people to want to adopt?,"I grew up in a foster home, and I really want to have a family.

Obviously I do not like sex, but also I have very unfavorable genetics and I do not want to pass them on.

However I grew up in a foster home that was awful. And I think probably one of the only good things I could accomplish in life is probably getting a kid out of one of those terrible places. But I would need to be much better than I am now and have a partner who also wanted to.

Trying to understand asexual friend.,"I have a friend who identifies as aromantic asexual, I think I understand both definitions well, I fall on the aro spectrum myself although I am sexual. He isn't touch averse and we do enjoy some occasional cuddles.
What kind of confuses me is that he's had sexual relationships in the past and he speaks about them fondly. He had also brought up sex around me frequently (once we had an hour long conversation all about his sexual preferences and a bit about mine where he used a lot of inclusive ""you"" statements shortly after him stating he doesn't get anything out of talking about sex with his friends). He seems particularly fond of bringing up blowjobs, but claims he's not that into them even though his statements make it seem otherwise.
I guessed I'm wondering if any other aces out there can make sense of this behavior. He's said he's not interested in sex in general at the moment, but if he wasn't a self-described ace I wouldn't have ever guessed it. 
TL:DR; my aro ace friend spends a lot of time talking about sex with me, but it seems contrary to how he says he feels about sex. ",Asexual

"Has anyone else repeatedly been called gay, when you're actually asexual?","It's just pretty annoying because people think that any guy who isn't hyper-masculine sex-obsessed is gay. 

I used to pretend to *oo* and *ah* when my friends showed me pictures of girls. I made the occasional comment in support of what they were saying. Now I'm done pretending. 

I feel sorry for all those people who have called me gay for expressing my personality, showing my feelings, and hanging around girls. Because it must be a pretty sad life to be afraid of expressing your own personality for fear of being accused of something that people in 2017 shouldn't even care about. 

So yeah. Why don't you see past your own narrowed-minded cultural viewpoint and recognize that not all men have to be obsessed with sex.

Am I asexual?,"I am 30 now but for as long as I can remember I have never really been sexually attracted to anyone. I have been in love before, and I have had sex with that person. But, I can't just up and do the hook up thing. I have to know who they are and value them. I don't look at women or men as sexual objects. I desire romance in the way that I hear people desiring sex. I crave deep connection with someone on an interpersonal level. I would have sex with that person if they wanted, but I could also go my entire life not ever doing it with them. I don't really get horny, and at times I do feel rather turned away by the idea of being sexual with someone. When I meet people who talk about sex in any way, I feel a sense of disgust- not against them, but about the subject matter. I don't understand why it seems like an outright conquest for so many to ""get laid"". 
I do enjoy physical affection quite a bit. It's a type of intimacy that makes me feel loved. 

I'm not a virgin. I feel like I have only really done sex to make previous partners happy. How lonely does it get being asexual, and will I ever find anyone who can relate to me? I guess this seems like a silly question but my god everyone requires a sexual relationship! Everyone. It seems like I will be forever alone. ",Asexual

How do you deal ?,"I am an asexual dating a sexual at the moment. We have been together for a year now and partway through our relationship, I once mentioned that if the desire to have sex gets too much, he is free to look for it elsewhere, under certain conditions. 

And if he really feels unhappy about our no-sex arrangement, he is free to break up anytime. 

So today, he brought the topic up. He feels bad about asking me if he could look up escorts etc. to be honest, I expected this to pop up sometime in the relationship, just didn't expect it to be so soon.

He haven't made up his mind yet but he wants to hear my opinion. He doesn't want to do it if it makes me unhappy. 

It hurts. 

I have been crying for an hour. It hurts. 

It hurts even more when he tries to reassure me that he loves me no matter what. It hurts so much because it feel like a slap to my face. That he loves me but I am not enough. 

It hurts so much. I know I laid it out as an option because I know i cannot satisfy/fulfill that need.

But being prepared for it to pop up in conversation doesn't mean I don't hurt. 

I know that if I'm so bothered, I probably shouldn't have offered it or compromise. But I can't. I am trying, but I can't. 

Another friend of mine who is also an asexual probably already anticipated this problem that I would encounter. And it sucks to know that he is right. 

I hurt. But I don't want my bf to be unhappy either. Sometimes, I just wish I am normal. 

UPDATE: As per advice in the comments, I've briefly spoken with the boyfriend on the matter and we are trying to try some other compromises to see how well it goes. If not, I'm sure this would be an issue to be addressed in the future. I thank everyone who had been kind, patient and understanding with my mess of a post. I admit, I clearly didn't think it would be this hurtful when I brought it up to him early in the relationship. I was obviously wrong and I feel bad because I'm essentially breaking a promise.

I want to put together an anthology about asexuals recognizing and coming to terms with their asexuality.,"I have identified myself as being somewhere on the asexuality spectrum all my life. I'm in my mid-20s. 

Recently, I heard about a friend who doesn't feel attracted to her serious boyfriend, and was doubting her sexuality. There isn't any conversation about this - and nobody easily reveals themselves as asexual. 

For instance: I once asked a non-asexual if she had always felt turned on when she made out with the guys in her past, and she said that she had felt attraction and turned on every single time! I doubt its possibility, because she had candidly told me that she never felt attracted to one of the guys she dated. So yeah. 

I wanna do this. You can choose to be anonymous and identify yourself in any manner you choose (male/female/androgynous/asexual/pansexual/whatever). I want this to be a collection of stories. Once I have spoken to a few people, I'll start putting it up on Medium, I imagine.

Expecting too much in search for SO?,"I've not been in any type of relationship in years. I dated for a time maybe 2-3 years ( mostly short relationships longest was maybe 5 months ) as I was trying to figure myself out. 
Have not dated since I firmly realized I was asexual and have never experienced any type of attraction. ( I kinda think I was pushing myself a lot when I was first dating to conform to the typical social / societal expectations ) 

Anyway ~ main topic I'm thinking about perhaps dating again and wondering if these are too high expectations when looking for a SO or if you all think they are fine + any advice? 

3 main things coming to mind when thinking about a SO are: 

Asexual ( this would make things a lot easier I think as far as expectations / understanding ) 

Otaku ( this is more flexible and not like a necessity but more like a dream that I could watch anime with someone and they would also enjoy it ) 

Vegan or at least on their way there  ( this is probably the most necessary one for me. I enjoy cooking and have no problem doing all the food shopping etc so I don't think it would be a lot of work for potential SO. It's pretty important to be on the same page on this for me. )

Was recently advised to try to meet an asexual woman,"My story is a very long one, but if you don't want to read the whole thing, I'll just say in this first paragraph that while I'm heterosexual, for a variety of reasons I'm unable to participate in a sexual relationship. I'm also hetero-romantic and very much crave female companionship, but I come with a lot of baggage that not everyone would be up for dealing with. My purpose for posting this is that I was recently advised to try to meet an asexual but hetero-romantic woman. My question is in regard to if my situation is too much to take and should I just stay single, and is approaching an asexual woman when I am not asexual myself out of bounds and something I shouldn't be doing.

With that said, here's one hell of a long explanation:

I'm 33 years old, have Asperger Syndrome and am more or less crippled by rheumatism. I also have Crohn's Disease, so it's no exaggeration when I say I live my life in constant pain.

In addition to the AS, I have a congenital right brain hemisphere defect that causes a portion of my occipital lobe to cease functioning at random, making me virtually incapable of performing any job. I've been fired from more jobs than I can count and have tried and failed numerous times to make a living through self employment.

I have never had a sexual/romantic relationship as an illness I developed in childhood has rendered me permanently impotent. I was sexually abused throughout my early childhood and I'm at a point now where it constantly plays like a video on loop in my head and nothing has worked in getting it to stop.

I've gone to most every kind of therapist you can think of, tried nearly every kind of neurological and psychological treatment, been on a host of medications, all of which have failed to cure even one element of my suffering.

I live in government funded housing and the only bills I'm able to pay on my own are my cable/internet bill and car insurance. Even that will soon be beyond my capability as the inheritance I received when my grandfather died is about to run out. Going on disability is not an option as I've already drained enough of other people's hard-earned tax dollars.

As far as the Asperger Syndrome goes, I've had it for all of my life, as did both of my siblings. It began to manifest itself pretty much as soon as I entered school (though at the time it was labeled as ""Non-Verbal Learning Disability) and consequently, I spent a lot of time in special education classes and nearly every special ed program the schools had. Needless to say, this made me the target of incessant bullying, even more so than I would have naturally been.

My parents chose to hide the diagnosis from all three of us, instead choosing to berate us whenever our symptoms showed up, screaming at us for not making friends, calling us lazy when we struggled academically, and saying we robbed them of the chance to have friends by not being able to play sports and introduce them to other kids' parents.

I only found out about my diagnosis when I was 16 and applying for my first job. I was looking for my birth certificate and in the search found a mountain of paperwork about me detailing my disabilities and the results of all the tests I'd taken in school when my parents were ""trying to find out why was so lazy and apathetic"".

To this day, they deny ever hiding anything from us or having known anything about the situation, even though they were caught red-handed. I sought out therapy on my own when I was old enough and was formally diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when I was 23.

I've tried DMARDs, physical therapy, and holistic methods, but so far no luck. Cimzia is the only Crohn's medication that has been able to do much for me, but at best it's about a 10% relief. I've tried many different diets too, but to no avail.

In regard to the brain function, I have trouble with visual processing but also with the integration of information, especially when it is presented too quickly. As I've been told by neurologists, the different parts of my brain don't communicate in the fashion that they should, especially with oral directions or carrying out a process. Even when I know exactly what I'm doing, there's a portion of my brain that basically shuts down at random, even if only for a few seconds at a time.

As a result of this, carrying out a multi-step process is very hard for me to do. For example, let's say I'm trying to make a spreadsheet. I know I'm supposed to read the information, enter the data, save the document, print it, and close it out. Even though I know the process by heart, my brain can skip out on me between steps such that I make the full spreadsheet but then skip over saving and printing and immediately close it before saving and the whole thing is gone (or alternately I may save it but never print it). That's not the specific situation that's led to be me being fired most of the time, but just an example of how my impediment works.

I spend hours every day scouring job boards, putting out applications, and either never hearing back or being rejected. When I try to be more aggressive and give a call or e-mail as to the status of my application, I'm always just told to be patient and that they'll get back to me, but it's very rare that this happens. 

Since my resume is mainly self employment and comprised of skills that have since been eliminated by apps, I'm not qualified for many jobs. Even when I do get hired, my troubles are just beginning as if I'm not fired for my incompetence, I eventually will be for absenteeism caused by my illnesses.

As far as the permanence of the impotence is concerned, it seems to be just that. I've seen many doctors and tried many medications but none work. This may be in the ""too much information"" category, but I've had a loss of erectile tissue and while I can briefly maintain an erection, I can't get much sensation during sex so the only experiences I've had have ended in humiliating failures and the women involved thinking I just wasn't attracted to them.

Due to this, I've never had a real relationship in all of my life. I've been on a lot of medications to address the PTSD resulting from the sexual abuse I suffered, but again, my efforts have been an exercise in futility. Clonadine (sp?), Klonopin, Amitriptyline, and Xanax are enough to help me get a few hours of sleep per night, but that's about it. The memory cycles ebb and flow, but right now they're at an extreme high. 

I live in the USA and I'll be fully broke by June if I can't find some way of generating an income. I'm on Medicaid (I had better insurance in the past) which doesn't cover a whole lot, so when it comes to the best of the best treatment, it's out of reach.

I'm reluctant to go on disability because I know how hard people work for what they're able to take home and how so much of it is already taken away by way of taxes and employers providing sub par wages due to the economy. I have a great degree of respect for anyone who puts in a hard day's work and the last thing I want to do is indirectly penalize them for it in order to keep someone who doesn't contribute anything of worth such as myself living.

I don't have much of a family. My sister died of alcohol poisoning in 2008 and my brother died of natural causes as a teenager. My father is alive but I haven't seen or spoken to him in 6 years as he's disowned me for not providing him with grandchildren, as having his last name carried on means more to him than anything else. He's gone as far as to accuse me of being homosexual, which I'm not and saying that my sexual health issues and PTSD are just a cover for my sexuality. Please understand I have nothing against LGBTQ people, but he does and when he makes these accusations they're meant to be an expression of scorn.

I see and talk with my mother a few times per month but we're not all that close. However, she's the main reason why I have any qualms about suicide as she's very religious and thinks it's a one way ticket to hell. She considers my sister's death to have been a suicide (it may have been, but I don't know) and frequently states she can handle the death, but not knowing that her only daughter is in hell.

The only meaningful relationship I have is with a nurse who I see three times per week at a neurology clinic where I go for services. In addition to being the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, she's also the best person I've ever met. She's the most kind, caring, compassionate, selfless, and giving person I've ever known and she goes above and beyond in trying to help me. Needless to say, I'm head over heels for her, but knowing that we'll never have a relationship beyond nurse and patient and the fact that she'll never see me as anything other than a poor creature to be pitied is heartbreaking for me.

Bi or Asexual,"I'm just going to throw this out there to see who all feels this way in hopes of helping people explain their situation to others that don't understand.

You get the dumb questions, you get the mean questions, and you get the questions where they clearly aren't taking you seriously and are just humoring you. When I first came out, I was very accommodating to people and I was pretty happy to explain what a sexuality meant to people who asked nicely, but after almost 2 years of that, I'm so done with explaining the same thing over and over and over.
     I began discussing this with my best friend last night, and I decided that I was going to make a little informational pamphlet basically explaining what a sexuality is, answering FAQs, explaining romantic orientations and the like. I plan on publishing this in PDF format online for all of you lovely folks when I'm all done. I feel that this could be useful for people coming out for the first time, or for those you meet who just don't get it and ask the same questions over and over again. 
     I was hoping I could get some feedback from you guys on what I should include. I don't want to get to  in depth  but I definitely want people to feel more informed and understanding after they read it. So far I'm including:

-The definition of asexuality (more urban dictionary than webster)
-[Degrees](http://pin.it/oF38oWF) of asexuality 
-Some common misconceptions (ie we are broken, that our sexuality is necessarily a direct result of past trauma or mental illness
-A basic guide on romantic orientations ( so far im doing Aro, Homo, Hetero, Bi, Pan, Grey, Fray, Demi, Poly, Litho, Abro [ect](http://pin.it/swXhdxo))
-Pride flags (for all romantic orientations listed, as well as the Ace pride flag)

I'm certain there's quite a bit that I've left out that you guys feel would be relevant, so if I've missed something please tell me down below or message me!",Asexual

Anyone currently married to or dating a asexual and how do you cope?,"Me and my wife have been together for 10 years since high school. Being young and not knowing what asexual was I just figured my now wife then girlfriend just wasnt big on sex. Fast forward to the present and I am suffering from paranoia and low self esteem as well as mood changes and short tempers. It is not all my wife's doing as there are other stressors in my life however I feel the longer I don't receive any help or advixe that I may go off the deep end. After exiting the military my depression and anxiety have gotten worse. Also I am often around family members who are married who are very open and active in their sex lives. Keep in mind were all in our 20s. Me and my wife are late 20s. 

My wife shows no sign or symptom of wanting sexual gratification in any form. Shs doesnt care to look at men or women in a sexual way and has NEVER masturbated with a dildo or her fingers. She's only ever grinded a pillow when she was younger. 

In most cases I engage or try to engage sexual activity. I'm fairly attractive with a decent body build and a sick ass beard that she likes. I take pride in wanting to give my partner pleasure but it really doesnt matter for her. 

I feel like I'm rambling but ultimately I'm not sure what to do. I use porn to remedy myself of my sex drive but I feel its not going to be enough one day or its going to wear me down more mentally. I love my wife and family and would hate to end up making a mistake that will ruin everyones lives. ",Asexual

Asexuality and medication,"So I don't know if this is even an answerable question. I think I'm asexual, but I'm not sure. When I was in high school I wanted to have sex with my boyfriend at the time (now husband) but not because I felt the drive to do it (always had a virtually non existent libido),more like I wanted the closeness and to make him happy. Once the novelty of sex wore off a few months into the relationship, I still did it for his sake, and faked how into I was. That was 14 years ago now! 

Intimacy has pretty much always been a bit 'gross' to me. I'd close my eyes when Disney characters would kiss on to and whatever. Never really grew out of that... but the thing is that I've always been medicated for depression and anxiety. Since I was in primary school. For 12 years of my adult life I've tried to come off the meds but it always ends messily. So I now accept that medicine is forever a part of my life. But I'm reasonably certain that the meds contribute to my asexuality/low libido. If I'm medicated forever, should I identify as asexual, or because the potential reason for my asexuality is a side effect of medication, am I just a damaged allosexual? Does it even matter? 
 
I think I want to know if I should keep trying to change myself or just accept that I don't want sex... ",Asexual

Does anyone develop...fascinations?,"I've never been sexually attracted to anyone nor romantically. The idea of dating someone or having sex is not interesting to me.

However, I tend to develop fascinations with people, whether real or fictional. They aren't really asexual crushes, per se, because it's not driven by a want to be their friend or anything. I simply become very interested in the way they think, how they became that way, their lives, habits, interests, fears. I think it's driven by admiration, in a way. I get fascinated equally by both women and men. At the same time I'm extremely wary of coming across as creepy and/or romantically motivated, so I usually don't express anything outwardly.

Input wanted - Partly Asexual or hormones out of whack? Something else?,"Hi All,

I had a couple of quick questions that I was hoping you could help me with. I was on birth control pills for at least seven years from the time I was a young teen to an adult and has almost no sex drive. (Completely non-existent)

I got off of the pill and now I get sexually aroused for about 5-7 days in the middle of my cycle (ovulation). Once that feeling wears off, my sex drive is completely gone again. But during this time period I am hypersexual.

During the time I was on the pill, I thought I was asexual. As a young teen, I didn't know that the pill can suppress people's sex drive. 

I also could never date someone I did not have a romantic interest in. I could never have a one-night stand. As a teen I used to love reading romance novels with good plot/character development. I didn't care if the books had sex scenes in them or not. I really hate books like 50 Shades of Gray. I can't just read smut, I care more about the story-line. 

I enjoy going on dates, receiving flowers, and hanging out with people of the opposite sex (I'm female). 

From what I know my hormones are ok, but I have some nutritional deficiencies that my Doctor is correcting. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Do some people only get aroused during ovulation? Are some people only attracted to a few types of people and not really attracted to anyone else?

Many people have told me that they think about sex all the time and I'm not really like that. I do feel like there is a lot more to relationships then just sex because you spend 80% of the time with your SO doing non-sexual things.",Asexual

Are there any funny Asexual stereotypes?,"Warning: mention of homophobic stereotypes ahead!

I was recently talking with two friends (one asexual and one allosexual) and we started talking about stereotypes in the LGBT community. We weren't really discussing the harmful ones, (such as gay people are perverts, trans people are just confused and hormonally imbalanced, bi people are sluts,etc)  but the funny, vaguely gaycist ones, like the stereotype that lesbians love flannel and Home Depot. During the conversation, I realized that I didn't know of any stereotypes about asexual people.

Difference between asexuality and depression-induced lack of sexdrive,Just a question,Asexual
Could asexuality be culturally caused?,"I am here because I'm questioning whether or not I'm asexual. I have always been very sex averse and while I sometimes feel like having sex in theory, when I'm ""in the moment"" with a guy I feel no desire whatsoever to do anything more than kiss.
So of course I'm wondering why this is happening--is it just that I've never had a positive sexual experience that I feel so averse? Is it something biological, do I have low libido? Or...is it because of how I grew up?
I grew up in a conservative Catholic family. My parents never talked to me about sex or ever let me hear about it; to this day if there's a sex scene in a movie or something they will turn it off (and I'm 20). I kind of missed the phase where everyone stopped seeing sex as gross and weird and started pursuing it, and I was incredibly naiive about it and scared of it for so long. I still have trouble seeing sex as good; I feel like I'm not allowed to want it (and I don't). I love kissing and cuddling but I grew up thinking that was desirable...
What do y'all think? Are asexual people more commonly from conservative families? Can it be culturally influenced, or are they independent?
",Asexual
Repulsed by sexuals,"I don't think about it too much usually, but i'm really repulsed by sexuals, and therefore to people in general. It's not even hatred because they don't have so much importance to my eyes, it's more a feeling of desolation and pity, i could say a form of empathy despite the fact i dislike everything about sexuals, from A to Z: how and what they think, what they do...what they are, as if everything about them could be thrown into a giant garbage.

Don't get me wrong, i'm not a psychopath at all. It's not to the point of feeling no empathy at all, because i don't like when people suffer for example, but when it comes to the idea of spending time with a group a friends, the idea is really repulsive because their whole mindset revolves around sexual relationships. And when they don't talk/act in a totally disgusting and vulgar way, they just become boring and without ""soul"" somehow, like empty ""sheels"" or pieces of meat which are driven by...i don't even know.

I know i still would be a loner if other people were different, i mean most of the time because i enjoy my own company and i have many things to do, but the idea of having close friends, in this world, is not attractive at all. Maybe this feeling is mutual, and if that's the case, then it's all good.

"What's with all the ""I've been cured"" and ""I want to be cured"" posts recently?","I've noticed an influx of people claiming to be ""cured"" of their asexuality, or wanting a ""cure"" for asexuality. Usually they have low libido mixed up with asexuality, they don't seem to understand the difference between sexual attraction and sex drive.

"Exploring the possibility of being asexual, but I'm not sure. I'd really appreciate any insight!","Here's what I know for certain: I'm male, I'm 26, and porn of any type doesn't interest me. Actually I find it all kind of repulsive. I'm not attracted to genitals on males or females, or any part of anyone's body, except one: chubby guys' belly/navel area. Only if they are covered from waist-down. I experience very serious arousal to that and that only, and I masturbate (albeit in a very non-traditional way - that's a discussion in itself). But not interested in any sexual activity otherwise.

Here's the more detailed stuff: I knew that stuff in my teens, but in college I start experimenting anyway. I became intimate with several girls throughout that time, and when we got home I always got briefly aroused from her touching my torso, but that arousal always quickly died out. I got nothing from exploring her body.

Ok, so females are not for me. So eventually I admit to myself that I'm gay. Even though I don't have a desire to have sex with a guy, I'm attracted to that one thing and it happens to be when it's on a man. So... gay. Right?

Not exactly. Eventually got to dating and getting intimate with a guy for the first time. It's better, I'm very turned on by his body (belly). But I didn't like touching his dick, didn't particularly like him touching/putting his mouth on mine. Very much disliked his playing with my butthole, ZERO desire to go anywhere remotely near his.

As of now, I've rolled around in bed with at least 6 people, male and female, and have never reached orgasm, or even come close. Makes relationships with sexual people very difficult.

Advice needed,"I have a friend who really has a hang-up with me identifying as asexual. When I found out about the ace community, something in me just sort of clicked. I've always described myself as a 'lesbian who just doesn't want sex', so to have an actual term for it was just this huge relief.

My best friend (...though not for long if this keeps up) not only refuses to accept it, but mocks me for it, tells me I'm lying, and last night, said ""It's like identifying as transgender without the sex dysphoria. It doesn't work like that. I could call myself a redhead without dying my hair, too.""

I might be asexual and I'm afraid how it will affect my relationship ... need advice,"Hi Reddit , forgive me for the awkward mobile formatting . 

The more the situations arise , the more I can't discern if I'm asexual or just terrified of sexual intimacy . whatever the case is, I'm afraid in the future it will eventually affect my relationship negatively .

For a little background to this , my boyfriend is an incredibly sweet and understanding guy , but he seems to feel bad that I really am not eager to let him do anything to me sexually , as he wants to ( but never pressures me ) . He's basically put me on sexual speed dial and is like "" if you ever want anything done just tell me "" . Most people would be like "" HELL YEAH "" But I'm over here like "" Oh god what ""

Now , he by no means guilts me , he's typically very understanding , like I said . But he says he would rather do things to me and make me feel good and doesn't care what happens to him / he doesn't expect anything in return .

I don't know if I'm asexual or just so self conscious that I'm afraid something will go wrong . I overthink everything . Everything . And I'm terrified it's gonna be awkward . To me sex seems awkward , anything overly sexual seems awkward . Again I don't know if it's a fear thing or I'm asexual and just am having a hard time coming to terms with it ... 

My boyfriend and I have talked about it before but the conversation always drops off . I'm worried that one day he'll leave me because I can't do anything for him and I'm terrified of anything being done to me . I feel guilty and weird like something's wrong with me . 

I guess I could just really use some advice on where to go from here . I really don't know what to do . Sorry to reiterate but I don't know if I'm just nervous and if so is there a way to get over it ?? ( people just tell me to "" relax and let it happen "" but don't seem to understand that's impossible for me , someone who hyper-overthinks everything ever ) or what the deal is ...

Asexuality and Masturbation. What's your experience?,"I consider masturbation a compulsive act. I started when I was very very young and used it as a way to distract myself away from depression and relieve boredom, anxiety, and stress. Sometimes I'd masturbate up to 5 times a day. 

Thing is... orgasms are nothing. It only kills about 5 mins and the feeling is...boring? I think maybe I'm just so used to it I can't feel it any more. It's not a feeling I crave or am interested in ""recovering"". Like I said before... it's more of a compulsion. 

Err, there's a part of me that thinks I'm a wild kinky whore but I'm trying to repress it... But I've had the chance, I've tried to get really really into it (I tried to fake it so hard even I might believe it), and it really just feels blah?

Guys, I went to see a psychiatrist for ADHD. After a few months of ADHD treatment, she told me she'd like me to try an antidepressant. I was a little surprised, but also not at all. I always knew there was something wrong with me, but it wasn't full blown depression. Here's a small list:


* No sexual desire


* Not very excited when good things happened


* Sleeping too much (10-12h wasn't enough) and feeling generally lazy


* Too shy and having hard time expressing myself


**I always thought I was like this and there was no way to get better. Laziness and shyness were just part of my personality, just like asexuality. All of the symptoms I listed are MUCH better or solved.**

Neurotic,"I have always heard the phrase dating=sex from other people all the while. Thus, I have never really tried to date anyone ever. It's why in my 26 years of living, I've never gone on a date before. It's plain as day the reason why. And that doesn't feel good.

I have avoided getting into close relationships with people because I'm just afraid to have sex. I'm afraid to be their target, and I'm not comfortable with advances. Or with being *sexualized*. It's like predators stalking their prey in the wild, trying to feed their hunger. And you are their target, never safe from danger. And it really frightens me.

In a field of land mines.

I just don't think I could ever have sex. I'm just not sure.  Even though I sometimes wonder what sex is like because after all sex bombards us everywhere, I just don't know whether or not I could have sex with anyone. Sex seems way too objectifying and unfitting, which is obviously seen in the magazine and TV industry. There aren't any magazines that I see without people in bikinis and skin tight clothes, or guys with no shirts showing muscles. I don't know. Sex seems objectifying to me when I see that, and I don't want to be put into that territory. 

All the while sex leaves me so unsettled and frazzled  I have even tried to think of being in love and married with a love partner, but even then I really don't think so. First off, why would they do that with me anyway? I can't pictur that. I'm not the super-hot guy, I don't think.

And the reason behind that is this: I think it's because sex scares me completely.

I have a secret to confess: I think I have a **""sexual neurosis"".**

I even have a hard time just thinking about sex in general.

I have had nightmares where I have to confess that I'm a virgin. The thought really scares me. I just get scared to tell people I'm a virgin, because I worry that people will find out I'm still a virgin and begin to pick on me and ""virgin shame"" me. I worry that people will laugh at me for being a virgin, and that I'll get made fun of by them. I imagine that and my stomach just really goes crazy on me, and I'll start losing sleep over it.

That's one dream that scares me for sure. 

However, what gives me constant nightmares is someone trying to have sex with me. The image of me having sex is *harrowing.*
 
The thought of me having sex leaves me astronomically neurotic. I mean, *figeting* and trembling. Earthquakes. Someone touching my penis or me seeing a like vagina is scary enough. The thought of having to do such an art to please a partner and going through all that is even more scary for me. I mean, the private parts, and touching naked parts just seems really inappropriate and unnatural. The fact that relationships are based on being attractive, how you perform for them, and being good in bed is frightening for me. And then you have to do it good. It's scary to think about. 

And I am not comfortable with being touched myself. Why people would want to touch me is another thing. Regardless, the thought of someone getting that close to me is so scary to me. It just adds a ton of pressure and stress to the situation. I don't get naked in front of people, all exposed and stuff. I don't let that happen. And sex obviously involves naked, so No way! Paralysis... The thought that they want to have sex with me makes me super nervous. I mean, they'll see my penis and everything. I'm so scared of that ever happening. I'm just too uncomfortable with that. That's super intimidating to be nude in front of another person. That's stressful to think about.

Then you add on that you are seeing someone naked too, and that's pretty scary to me. Plus, sex is a touch act, so you have to touch them too. Like touching boobs, butts, and like nakedness. That just seems like invasive and 'rape-like'. Inappropriate behavior, Like sexual harassment. Way too forward and it just seems untoward to me . I just think that it would make the other person nervous if I did. It would definitely make me uncomfortable, that's for sure. I feel pretty awkward thinking about touching someone else's privates. It just I feel completely anxious just thinking about it, and it's far from happening.

My anxiety levels are like peak high when it comes to it. I get so freaked just whenever the topic of sex comes up in conversation. Or anything related to nudity and stuff. Once those conversations come up at work or with like friends, my stomach just begins turning knots and I start feeling sick. It really happens. 


It's a thought I want to avoid. And I didn't even bring up the STDs and pregnancy thing. That skyrockets the issue.

I mean, if only humans never had to have a sexuality, then it would be so much better. I wouldn't be the odd one out then. It would just be much easier for me that way. An innocent type love. *Less threatening.* I mean, I don't judge people who have sex at all. At least I don't think I do. I just feel freaked over it, and feel uncomfortable with the thought. It's doesn't seem too inviting for me. That's how I feel.

And here I thought all men were supposed to be like *""sex-driven maniacs""*. Yet here am I, all frightened of it. I feel a bit weird being a guy saying this.

However, it is the truth. Whenever people try to like be sexual with me and touch me or something, I just get really nervous and timid. I feel like things are out of control, and I don't like it at all. I get nervous and scared when it happens. Sex is just too much pressure. I feel messed up saying that.

However, I feel even weirder saying that I'm apprehensive and am prudish in terms of sex. I used to get the prude label, and I would always hate it. But when it comes down to it, I guess it may indeed be true for me. I just have an internal fear related to sex, and it really is discomforting for me. 

It's physically discomforting and internally concerning all the more. Obviously, the anxiety levels are crushing and isn't good for my health. I need to deal with that in some way. However, I also know it's not mentally healthy to be afraid and neurotic all the time, just avoiding people because of it too. It sounds irrational to think of that, but I just can't help doing that, though. I just am too afraid. And I'm not wanting to have sex.

I know I need to make friends and everything. I just can't be ""unsocial"" forever. It sounds crazy to avoid people. However, with sex all out there, I wonder if I'm doing the right thing. Right?

I am immensely frustrated about the tension in this. It's like we're dating but not dating. I am very comfortable with my asexuality and I have shied away from looking for relationships because I don't want to make someone give up sex for me but I feel like I've fallen into what I would call a relationship without it being one.

"Another ""what am I"" post - 45 woman, feel bisexual, only like cuddling","I'm a 45 year-old woman and I'm confused about myself. I enjoy looking at the bodies of both men and women and I have physical thoughts for both sexes (wanting to touch/kiss). I've spent much of my life thinking I'm bisexual. 

However, I've never had an orgasm and I don't enjoy intercourse. I've been to several doctors and there's nothing physically wrong with me. I wasn't abused or molested as a child. I just don't like sex. I like petting and I don't want to go any further than that. It's an awkward place to be. People understand asexual or sexual. They don't understand someone wanting to cuddle with no intercourse.

All of my romantic relationships have been very messy. I keep ending up in relationships with people who see me as a challenge and then become angry and abusive when they can't move me. I've been told since I was a teenager that I'm either frigid or a tease.

As part of going to doctors I've also seen a couple psychiatrists and sexual therapists. They all gave me the same diagnosis. I'd suffered some sort of sexual trauma that I'd blocked out, and I just had to work on teaching myself to orgasm and once that happened I'd be on the way to healthy sexual relationships. In order to be a fully realized and healthy person, I had to get over my sexual hangups/problems and have intercourse or I had to be completely asexual and avoid all physical contact with other people.

Asexual with libido I want to get rid of,"First off I'd like to point out its pretty cool reddit let me swear in my username. It's a frustrating thing.

Secondly, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask something like this, but through all my google searches, I can't find a post related to this that I relate to.

A lot of people online looking for ways to lower libido are men who have a problem with being horny and need to relieve themselves like, 5 times a day, because it's a problem, or there's some other extreme underlying (sometimes criminal) factor they need to get rid of.

I'm a female who only gets ""horny"" once every couple of weeks, but I wish it didn't happen at all. I want to throw up every time I so much as feel it coming on, and especially afterwards when I do actually feel nauseated by the whole thing. I've looked into licorice root pills and ordered some for myself to give a try.

""Relieving myself"" is a chore (one that makes me sick which I would think would make it go away on its own...it doesn't), when I try to ignore it and put it off it just gets worse, and even though it's not like it ""wastes time"" because its relatively quick, I just. Want it to never happen. Ever. It's not a factor I want existing in my life.

How to come out to my boyfriend,"TW: brief mention of sexual assault, no details.

Xposted to another comm too.



I don't even know where to begin. I'm 25. I was sexually assaulted when I was ~6 years old and because of that I feel like I've never really been sexually attracted to men. I can find them hot and want to do all of the romantic aspects of things with men, but the idea of sleeping with them or fooling around grosses me out. In college I used to try to find guys to sleep with so I could feel like I ""fit in"" with society but it never ended up happening because while I could find men to hook up with, I could never let myself get that far. 

The childhood trauma really fucked me up to the point where I have a hard time even trusting men. My father wasn't in my life until I was ~13 and I've only spent the night at his house once because it made me uncomfortable. He's the nicest man but because he's just that, a man, it makes me uncomfortable. I had this problem too when I started dating my boyfriend. He wanted me to come to his house and I told him it made me uncomfortable to be alone in private with him. He knew my situation and respected that. Finally I was comfortable to go over a month or so later. 

Now it's several months in, we've said we love you, and I find myself having many periods of time thinking that I need to break up with him because I don't ever ever ever want to sleep with him and I know that's not fair to him. But I can't bring myself to have this conversation with him. I can't even talk about it with my best friends because I feel so broken and like a freak. Here's the real kicker though. I have fooled around with women and loved it. I am also romantically attracted to women, but I'm just ONLY romantically attracted to men. 

I just don't know what to do. He's been so accepting about everything else that I feel like this is one he won't be able to accept. I certainly don't blame him. Sex is a big deal in society. I just don't know how to approach this subject.

"Confused at what to do now....(M,25)","I'm a 25 year old heteromantic asexual guy, and I'm pretty much at a dead end when it comes to dating. While everyone is busy giving/taking it in all sorts of strange places (sorry If I gave you any mental pictures btw lol), I'm sitting back, chillin' like a villian, trying to figure out WHY such a simple act is fancied by the human race at large. Now on to my story; After growing up  a short scrawny and extremely shy fellow, in college I deceided to muster the courage to talk to the girls that I liked....it didn't dawn on me until about age 23/24 that these girls wanted me to flirt with them and seduce them SEXUALLY, and when I didn't reciprocate these flirtatious sexual gestures, these girls would dip out very quickly. It also dawned on me within this past year, that no matter how much communication I give them of who I am, straight women will go after what they want....and that's sex. I say all that to say this...I'm NOT COMPATABLE WITH STRAIGHT GIRLS. The only way I'd be able to get in a relationship with one is if I bang hard and bang often, and I JUST DON'T WANT TO, its not in my nature. All I want is female companionship, eskimo kisses, snuggling by the fire, holding hands in public, listening to a girl and engaging in nonsexual flirting and teasing, and whispering nonsexual sweet nothings to each other! It's all about that emotional and nonsexual physical connection. No sooner would I have sex with a girl, then I would pick her nose, lick her eyballs, or kiss her elbows. like NO, NO NO, and NO!  And no, I'm not willing to compromise with these girls, because not having sex is part of my identity and I'm not going to change that for any girl. I want a girl to accept me AS I AM because that's what love is, and I want to be LOVED, not lusted after. Besides, having sex before you are in truely in love only complicates things, and is not necessary for a loving relationship to work long term. Non-asexual people tend to have a much harder time figureing this out, but I digress.

All things considered, my best shot at  a decent relationship is with another asexual girl, but the problem is: A. There are two few of them in my area (or any area really), which leaves me with the only option of dating long distance. (I'm also not good at managing those types of relationships.) B. They are most likely dating non-asexual guys (very rarely have I seen/heard/read of two asexual dating each other) C. Very rarely have I seen an asexual girl with the same values as me. 

    I did, however date a gorgeous asexual filipina girl about a year ago, who DID have the similar values as me (I'm a Christian/conservative/libertarian). Eventually I broke it off with her because she started ignoring me. However, I personally had my own doubts about the situation because I know nothing about Phillipine culture (I'm African American), plus I'm not tech savvy, I have the technical skills of a 60 year old and I'm not smoothe with technology, so its hard for me to date online without goofing it up somehow...(our first date was awkward because of the technical difficulties). I just can't imagine doing that for months or freakin years, when I almost pulled my hair out trying to make things work online for the time we had. Anywho, I popped in a 6 months later to see how she was doing...she said she was ""getting at the age where she wants a life long partner"" (she's 3 years older). She also wanted to know when I would come visit her in Hong Kong.  Basically, she was on the chase and wanted a lifetime commitment from me and I told her it was too soon to talk about that now, and that we should take it slow. No response....looking back it seems like I shut her down, but that was definitely not my intention. 

      Like I said before though, it's harder for me to be myself and be smoothe when I'm trying to date girls through technology. I'm much better at dealing with people in person, than I am through texting or any other means of technica communication....(it's a major 21st century flaw I know). This is really the ONLY thing keeping me from getting back with her, Everything about her is amazing ( insofar as I have seen). I'm sort of thinking as I write here but, what do I have to loose? If It works out, it works out and if it doesn't...then I'm in the same position as I am now, which isn't bad. I have my family and friends who care about me, wholsome food, and a roof over my head. Now that I think of it, the only reason I was afaid to make it happen again was because I wanted to see If I could make it work with girls in my area, I just wanted to be close in proximity and relate to girls in person. 

   Truthfully though, I may be close in proximity to these straight girls, but I feel millions of miles away, and it seems to me that communication doesn't bridge the gap. Am I wrong?  I just feel thats women sexual appities these days are so off the charts that no amount of communication is going to change their drive to have sex with multiple men early and often. This is because every straight girl has multiple guys eating out of her ands at a time....me telling her ""I'm asexual, this is who I am""...will make her scoff at me and she will scurry off to fondle some dude who will ""turn her on"", as they say. That's just how it goes these days.

So what the HECK do I do!??

Do you think communication works to get straight girls?

Should I even bother with the girl overseas given my situation?

Would this scenario be offensive to asexuals? Is this something that is done?,"Background (sorry for the length of the post): 
My husband and I have been married about 5 years and dating 6 years before that. We are both heterosexual. We love each other dearly. We have a great relationship, minus the fact I'm more active (wanting to go out and do things) and he is a homebody (with some depression issues). The fact I'm more active hasn't really been an issue because until recently I've always been working and in school and haven't had a ton of extra time for fun. However recently, since I've finished graduate school, I finally have time to really live my life and pursue my hobbies. My husband mostly prefers to be home/video gaming/researching hobbies.  I've talked with him about doing more things together, but when he forces himself to do things with me I can tell he doesn't really enjoy it (mostly he complains). 
Question:
Lately, because of the above information and because I think I have a lot more love to give, I think I'd like to add another person to our relationship. (My husband and I don't want kids.) I've asked him about maybe dating a asexual girl and he seemed confused yet open to the idea.  Maybe I'm delusional, but I thought that maybe an asexual person would enjoy being part of a family (married couple with dogs) and we would enjoy having another partner in our family to live with and with which to enjoy life. 
I see this triad of sorts being beneficial for all, but it's not really something I've read about online. The closest thing is polyamory, but I'm not necessarily looking for something sexual from the third person.

I been debating for 7 years I am grey asexual,,Asexual
"I found out what it was, and accepted it","I knew from an early age that I was different.  Unlike my friends, I wasn't obsessed with having my first kiss, or even holding hands.  

In high school, I was made fun of for avoiding girls and for never holding hands with or kissing one.  

I was even made fun of by my own mother for not getting caught with a girl in my bedroom and for being a virgin and for never kissing a girl.  Needless to say, I haven't spoken to her since I left home, which was 21 years ago.

Truth is, the thought of any physical contact with a woman (or a dude) in the romantic sense sickened me.  The notion of kissing and having sex literally made me vomit (as my Debate and Discussion class found out).

I didn't really understand what was going on with me.  Was I gay?  No, I wasn't attracted to dudes (not that there's anything wrong with that), and I certainly wasn't attracted to females.

So, I wasn't gay.  I wasn't bisexual.  What was I?  It wasn't until I was 23 when I found out that I'm asexual.

That created problems with my religion.  I'm Mormon, and we're supposed to get married young and pop out the babies.  I think I'd pass out if I actually had to put a part of my body into a part of a woman's body.  

It got to the point that the teasing at church and the ""advice"" of church leaders to get married and figure it out later drove me to the point of suicide.  

I actually set up shop in the tree in the back yard, with a rope and so forth after researching on the Internet.  My nosy neighbor saw me and ratted me out.

At some point, I learned to accept who I am and now I am perfectly happy and comfortable with it.  I live with a woman who is purely a friend and roommate.  

There is no sexual tension because neither of us are sexual.  And guess where I met her?  High school.  She was one of the few kids who didn't mock me.

There is no shame in being asexual.  Embrace it.  It's just like being straight, gay or bisexual.  Absolutely no shame.

Could really use some advice/support,"So this is something I've been struggling with for the past couple of years now and I've just thought now to seek out concepts such as 'not being sexual' and 'lack of libido' as I really do feel that I identify with them. It makes me feel a lot less alone to see that I'm not the only one because I've never met anyone who was asexual.

It's a bit of a long story but I'll try to keep things short. 

Grew up in a very conservative/Catholic area, went to Catholic school, etc., where girls were expected to be demure virgins until marriage. Any girl who had sex before marriage was essentially 'tarnished' and lost 'worth'. That was the rhetoric that was shoved down my throat at school and therefore how I came to view things and myself. 

In this Catholic school I never did have any issues really with crushes, urges, etc., as I just never really liked anyone. I didn't think anything of it as I just thought I was picky and it was slim pickings at a small school. I've come to realise now that I'm someone who can only feel any sort of attraction/feel the desire to engage in any sort of intimacy if I feel a strong emotional bond which makes sense now. 

Fast forward to uni and I was definitely a 'late-bloomer' as I'd never even kissed a boy. Felt prudish and lost, as well, being around people who were sexual/sexualised (my group of friends in high school shared the same views about sex). Anyway had a huge crush on a boy (my first real crush) and fairly enjoyed my first ever make-out session with him. Though I just couldn't understand how people could just hook up with someone on a one night stand or someone they didn't know--I just literally couldn't fathom how that might appeal to someone, as the idea of sex to me was still completely foreign.

Had a few crushes through uni, nothing serious though, some kissing, etc., but never really anything more and I only ever had the desire to do any of it if I felt a strong emotional pull to that person.

Fast-forward to the present, I'm married and for quite a few reasons my husband and I have virtually no sex life because I don't ever want/feel the desire to have sex with him. I was very attracted to him when we first met, the most 'hot and heavy' I'd ever been with a guy (very strong emotional bond), and he was the first and only guy I ever slept with. 

We met during my last year of uni, I graduated, went to live with him for 6 months to 'get to know him more' to see if it was worth it to move away from home to be with him and ended up getting married. I was still sexually attracted to him in the beginning. However somewhere along the line I just stopped being sexually attracted to him, and I think it's because there were times when he'd treat me really badly and his volatility and self-destructive nature came out which I think was probably what slowly started killing the emotional bond, and therefore the sexual desire. 

Now things are so tense between us because he just doesn't understand how I can be asexual or not sexually attracted to him because I was in the beginning. I just force myself to have sex with him because I feel that I have to. But I don't know if this is wrong?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Asexual

drinking games lead to no good,"So just want to get this off my chest (throwaway)...and say sorry to the girl at the party (tbh it was literally 10 of us drinking so not really a party but still)

My friends and I were playing a game in which you ask questions in 2 mins to someone (hot seat) and I asked which porn she watched because I've been asked it before and most people have interesting answers. She said she didn't, so I asked what porn she read (usually girls read erotica) and then one of our friends asked her about her sexuality...to which she said ace.
 
(context time)
Now, I've been kinda in the closet about being ace...hell I don't even know if I am. To most of my friends I am extremely sexual because I have sex with my boyfriend. What they don't know is that I look for an excuse not to have sex every single time he initiates it. I literally just have sex to keep my relationship and boyfriend happy.

Does being asexual effect your ability to be friends with sexual people?,"I am asexual and I was thinking about it the earlier and realized that that may have a small part in why I was never able to make lasting friendships in high school and beyond. This may sound weird but hear me out.  I never really made a strong connection with any of my friends because they would often spend SOO much time talking about how hot somebody was or sex etc. and I kind of just labeled them as ""sluts"" or just the type of people I didn't want to hang out with. (I now know I was wrong and that was just normal teen stuff) The conversations often lead to me feeling uncomfortable and eventually I would be asked who I thought was attractive and everyone eventually assumed I was gay and my answer was always ""idk"". But I felt a lot of pressure to conform and be like them or to just not hang out with them and I often chose option 2 and now I find that I really have never made any lasting friendships and even one of the two friends that I'm still in contact with I don't like to spend time with because conversations always turn to sex and why I've never had any interest in it and sometimes they go as far as her accusing me of thinking I'm better then her because I don't ""need"" sex and it's just very stressful for me so I avoid her but for some reason still keep of the act of being a friend.  

I do know some people who are ""out"" as asexual but they are friends of my younger sister and while I would love to get to know them better and seek their friendship, I've never really come out myself and i guess I don't really see the need to but it makes it difficult for me to know how to approach them to ask for advice or even just bring it up.

Does anyone have maybe any experiences to any of this or maybe advice on how to handle when conversations inevitably turn to sex? Or maybe how to make friends/meet people who are like minded...

I might have uncovered a weird aspect of my asexuality and would like input.,"So I think I'm asexual. I've been debating it for over a year, and I think I've come to a conclusion. I have a sexual relationship with my partner, but I believe some of the asexual trends still apply to me.

But I also realized something else recently. I am a woman, and I think a lot about how women's bodies are sexualized, often without their consent. I feel uncomfortable, therefore, being in public wearing clothing that accents (or even just portrays as they naturally are) my breasts or hips. I worry that other people see me as a sexual being, and I've realized that I DO NOT want that. I don't want other people to look at me and see me as a potential sexual partner or target. I love my current partner, and that sexual space is sacred with him. I don't want anyone else to see me as sexually available, even if he weren't in my life. The idea of anyone but him looking at me like that is repulsive and makes me so uncomfortable. Even sometimes with him I wish I were viewed/treated as a less sexual being. It's gotten to the point lately where I've wanted to bind my breasts and stop wearing feminine clothing because I don't want potentially-hungry eyes on my body at all.

Is this phenomenon because of my asexual tendencies? Do any of you also experience feelings like this? ",Asexual

I have a recently realized asexual boyfriend and would like some advice.,"I've been with my boyfriend for about 2.5 years now. We're both around 30, and our relationship is loving, affectionate, and strong. I love him completely. We've been in a largely open relationship for most of it, though neither one of us have acted on it much.

About a year into our relationship he stopped initiating sex as often. It became less until it got to the point of him only initiating when it was clear that I wanted him to.

We've had several frank discussions about sex, and he originally said that he still found me desirable, but found his libido lacking. I would initiate as well and he'd often have sex with me, but I could tell that it wasn't out desire for me, but out of desire to make me happy. It just didn't feel right that way. We haven't fought about sex; while I enjoy it, I don't feel it to be vital to a successful relationship.

This past week he told me that he didn't find anyone sexually desirable or attractive, myself included. That's when I realized that he's become asexual. We had a talk about that tonight, and I reassured him that I'm not going anywhere just because he doesn't like sex. But I also explained that sometimes, feeling desired and having someone sexually attracted to me is something I need. 

I don't know where to go from here. I told him I thought we could find a solution. He doesn't have any ideas on how we can come up with a solution, and now he's a little worried that he will lose me if I make use of our open relationship. Now, I know I'm not going anywhere (no one else matches me like he does) but I don't know what we can do to make sure my needs are met. 

So basically, any advice? Like I said, I love him fully, and this is in no way a ""deal-breaker"" for me, but I don't really know where our conversation should go from here.",Asexual
"I might almost have screwed up with my girlfriend, please let me talk this out with you all. Hope this isn't TMI.","I'm allosexual, my girlfriend has said to me before that she maybe thinks she is, or has in the past considered herself asexual. She said she herself isn't quite sure. When we started doing things she said that was the first time she felt like she wanted sex in any capacity. 
She herself doesn't actually like me doing anything to her (so obviously I don't) but she likes performing and often will initiate sexual acts with me. 
She's told me she had a bad experience before, and that people have suggested to her that maybe that was why she didn't want to be on the receiving end. After reading a bit here I've come across the term Placiosexual and sort of wondering if I should bring that up with her? Is that... presumptuous?  

Anyway on to the part I feel I've been idiotic about. She's told me she's only ever masturbated once or twice and has never orgasmed before. So I like briefly mentioned a vibrator and she didn't actually say yeah she just sort of was like oh sure maybe. And I didn't really discuss further but I went ahead and bought one, I was going to give it to her for her to try it out and hopefully you know ""discover"" herself. And now I feel really bad about it. I feel like maybe I wasn't listening to her when she said all that stuff and maybe she just really doesn't have any interest and this is me thinking of forcing her to enjoy something by giving her a vibrator. I haven't given it to her yet, I might not now.. IDK. Thoughts please? ",Asexual

"Was asexual as a teenager, no longer an asexual entering my mid-twenties. Has/Is anyone experience[d] this?","Hope this is the right sub to ask. So, yeah I guess I need to really explain. 

So, I'm no longer asexual. In fact, I'm pretty perverted in several ways now that three years have gone by, but that wasn't always the case.

So, for about the entirety of my teenage years, I didn't really have any sexual urges. Like, none whatsoever. In fact, when I heard about topics regarding sex, I would just be turned off or not really care. I had crushes, and later a boyfriend but never thought of them in a sexual way. I literally thought I was asexual until late into my third year of college. 

That's when I started developing sexual urges and thought of thinking about the opposite sex in *that* way.  And it would come at random intervals too. In fact, several months later, I would have sexual thoughts and urges that would come from nowhere, even if I'm in a situation that has nothing to do with men, sex, or anything of the like. Like making a bowl of cereal or cleaning. It literally began to take over my mind to such a point that I would begin to panic. While I think that is what most teenagers have to deal with and get accustomed to, to deal with it suddenly in my twenties. 

Just wondering, has anyone else experienced this phenomena? Or anything like it: going from no libido to suddenly high libido? Skipping that part of the teenage phase? ",Asexual
"My pre-op Transmale friend, who was sex-repulsed, has now developed a strong sexuality due to his testosterone therapy.","He told me today that he has developed strong sexual urges attributed to sex and sexual acts. Before the hormone therapy, he had never had any sexual urges and found sex and genitals repulsive in general. 

He said that he hooked up with a guy the other day after going on a date with him. He had a really good time but didn't orgasm, but is able to orgasm on his own and now watches porn. 

This news has blown me away! I knew that he had been having an increase in libido due to the hormone therapy but to now actually get aroused and desire sex is incredible. He's basically a completely different person from before hormone treatment (Still an awesome friend though!). 

We joked before the treatment about this stuff happening, so we still kind of find the whole thing hilarious. Anyways, thought you guys might find this interesting. ",Asexual
My boyfriend is asexual and I have questions.,"Hello!

I've been dating a really close friend for about 5 months now, its been amazing so far. He's asexual, while I think I'm somewhere between demi and hetero sexual. This is my first real relationship, so I'm not sure what is acceptable and what's not. I don't want him to feel uncomfortable, but he always initiates making out, and feeling me up. He talks to me like he wants to have sex, but I'm not sure. He told me he has no boundaries when it comes to sexual stuff, but his sexuality hasn't changed. He's told me that I make it hard for him to pee at times, and I'm pretty sure he gets aroused when we make out, and he kinda likes to grind his pelvis into mine. 

What I would like to know if you guys had any suggestions on what I could do to make him feel good. Should I take a chance and start reciprocating what he does, or would that be disrespectful? Is there a way to respectfully ask thesee questions? I would like some guidelines on how to proceed sexually because I usually leave frustrated with myself for wanting sex, but still head over heels that he does these things for me.

I am the first person he's been with since he came out (partially because I was the one who thought that he might be ace), so I want to set a high standard in case we don't work out, so his future partners respect his sexuality. 

Thank you! ",Asexual
I have no idea what's going on.,"Hello there,
 So I am a 34 year old male. I have had sex fairly consistently since I started being able to have sex. I have been on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications for almost 8 years now. I have never had side effects to anything but a few months ago my psychiatrist added another medication to the mix to help  me sleep, oh I have fairly strong insomnia(think Fight Club without the shirtless dudes fighting). But I have literally never experienced a side-effect from medications like this and I've tried a few. 

So now to my point of being here, I have lost my will to have sex. I am in a relationship with a woman and we haven't had sex in 2 months. I don't have the drive, the will, or the tool( if you catch my drift) to do it. I have been tested for everything and my testosterone is fine and my thyroid is fine and everything else under my skin is fine so it isn't that. Is it possible to wake up one morning after years of sex and just say ""meh this doesn't appeal to me anymore'?  And if it is just medication what have any of you done if that ended up being the case for you.  I love my girlfriend but I love being sane and not sad and anxious all the time. So it feels like a balancing act that I have no idea how to perform. 

I hope I didn't break any rules here. I didn't really read them, I just dove in for help. 

Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences.

Asexual or just inexperienced? Please help!!,"Hi all! I am a 28 y/o Indian (highlighted to give an insight to my cultural background) male. I am in bit of dilemma as I can't figure out if I am an ace or just a confused individual. Thought of posting my case (in detail) here in hope of getting some insights from you guys.

I have been into dating scene for the past 3-4 years (never felt the urge of dating and relationships till then). But I could never bring myself to kiss or sexually reciprocate to the person every time, even though she explicitly expressed the desire to do so. I guess, this can be a reason why none of my dates went past 3-4 dates.

To make the matter worse, once my friends took me to an 'all contact' strip-club in a north american country to experience a lap dance. Tbh, I was also excited to visit one. Any other guy would have enjoyed the act. But, I just couldn't enjoy the show. Instead, I felt repulsive and boredom throughout the 10-15 minutes the lady performed her acts to me. This does bothers me.

Also, as a brief insight to my teens. I first masturbated when I was 18. That too, as I felt good and was curious. It was also the time I started watching porn. Again, I watched it (and still do) as it felt good and seems like a natural thing to do while masturbating. I don't know if this 'good feeling' can be considered as sexual attraction?

However, lately, seeing my friends and cousins getting hitched and in serious relationships, have prodded the emotional wheels within me. I too want to find someone (not to get married, just for company), but my past experiences make me concerned about myself, and compels me to question myself of my sexuality. I don't want to focus my energy into a relationship without knowing my limitations, as ignorance would affect my partner's life too.

So, my question boils down to this, am I asexual? Or, is it pure lack of experience and under-confidence in these matters? What do you think? I hope to receive some suggestions, advice or constructive comments. Thanks!",Asexual
Fear of forever isolation,"So this whole ace thing (the realization, not the reality) is brand new to me, but at age 31 I'm beginning to see this as just another sign that I'm going to be alone forever, that there's no way I'm going to find compatibility in a sex obsessed culture. How did you guys get past that?",Asexual
Coming to terms with my possible asexuality,"For starters, I am ending a relationship (only lasted four months) this week because I think I am asexual. I really like the person, but I am slowly becoming more repulsed as we move more physical in the relationship. 

My background: I avoided sex in high school because I saw it create problems (pregnancy/jealousy) in others. I never dated in college because I didn't find the right person. When I met this new person I was totally happy to start a relationship and was hopeful that I might actually enjoy closeness/sex for once. But as the weeks go on I am slowly hating spending physical time with them. I feel so bad that I don't want that type of relationship anymore that I feel it best to separate. They clearly want a close physical relationship and I will in no way satisfy that.

I am interested in hearing if any of you think asexuality is hereditary. I ask because my mother has told me in adult confidentiality that she thinks my father has always been asexual (my parents divorced in my childhood). My mother said that my father rarely initiated sex, hated touching, and that it ""cost an arm and a leg"" to produce me. My fathers current marriage is similar. He shows minimal physical affections to his wife and anything they do (kissing/hand holding) is initiated by her and ends within seconds. I feel like I am headed down this path.

I'm confused still because I have always *admired* bodies. I will say ""Wow that person has an amazing butt."" However, the idea of enjoying sex with someone doesn't come to mind ever. Any experience I have had with sex is just ""when will they finish so I can put my clothes back on"". I do enjoy romance/sex in movies/books and have no problem finding others attractive. I just feel like I don't ever want to partake in that world with another person.

I see that there can be amazing and supportive communities so I am not completely put off by admitting to asexuality. I am worried though because I have always wanted to be married. I see marriage as this amazing family dynamic and definitely want children someday.

Polyamory?,"Hi guys. So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for years and years. Sex has always been a bit of an issue. I'm not sex-repulsed or even really sex-negative, more indifferent so we do have it sometimes but it's always been something that we did because it made him happy.

I recently discovered I was asexual and came out to him. He's been supportive in understanding that I just can't give him what he wants. We still have sex infrequently, but only when I feel up to it (in the sense that I don't particularly mind it, but I never actually want it). 

I don't remember how, but we got on the topic of polyamory today. I brought up the idea of him having sex with another partner to meet those needs and he wasn't against it but not really for it either. He's more conservative than I, so I think the idea shocked him a little bit.

I think it is something I would like to pursue (not immediately), but I was thinking we could discuss it more, hopefully speak with someone who has a similar relationship that works, and read about it. It's not something I want to jump into but I do think that if we could make something like this work we would be very happy.

Sex is our only real issue. We're best friends and I could see spending my life with him if it weren't for the sex. I'm also not a jealous person, so I don't foresee any issues on my end. Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward, or experience in this type of relationship?",Asexual

Would it be wise/possible to get back together with my asexual ex boyfriend?,"Hello everyone. I would like the input of asexuals and sexual partners of asexuals on the post breakup (of a relationship with someone who has not yet fully defined himself as asexual but does respond to most criteria and is thinking it through) considerations I am going through.

Three months ago, I broke up a 3 year old relationship with a man I loved and was going to marry in less than a year. It was all due to our mismatched desires: after years of trying to find some way of compromise, he was feeling very pressured to behave differently (than not touching me sexually in, say, 1.5 months) and I was feeling very abandoned because I could see no effort on his side to empathize with my frustration and do something to save the relationship with me.

One week before the breakup, we had decided to open our relationship so I could sleep with other people. He agreed to this but would never want to go into details (not even clear rules of engagement). Now I get he was not fully comfortable with the idea but did not know how to help me feel better.

The problem was, the moment I slept with someone (it was a longtime friend who I'd always had some unexplored chemistry with), the connection with this friend of mine grew exponentially in a very short time, and it made me realize I was missing more than sex (flirtatiousness, passion, mutual desire) and that made me feel like staying in the relationship with my ex fiancé was a mistake. That I was kidding myself.

So we broke up (my ex fiancé seemed unfazed by the ending; he has even told me by now that he felt relieved of the pressure of the past months) and I rode out the infatuation of the new relationship with my longtime friend as I was still processing a huge amount of grief for my lost relationship of 3 years. It was a confusing and problematic time (to say the least) and it's still not fully over.

It's been 3 months and the connection I felt with the first person I got involved with after opening the relationship is beginning to fade. Turns out I still miss the family I had with my former partner. Sure, I now have lots of good sex, but the compatibility we had in all other areas is SO HARD to match. This made me wonder for the first time if I should've given the open relationship scheme more time for my feelings to settle and to dissociate them from sex, so I could keep my former relationship going in all other fronts.

I hadn't considered for a second getting back together, but these past days nostalgia set in suddenly and I was wondering how it would or could be if we one day got together again. By now I know he would've wanted more time and space from me for him so he could figure out what he needed and could offer me (he feels like his lack of desire is not inherent to his personality but is rooted in some past problem), but I cannot imagine how I could've given more that 2.5 years to do something about it. If some of you could give me some insight on what this ""more time and space"" could mean.

I would also want to hear your thoughts on:

1) Whether any asexuals would understand someone they love –and who loved them very much– losing their ground regarding the value of the relationship they had with you because of their need for sex. 

2) If someone who's sexual but has partnered with an asexual has experienced something similar to my situation in which sex in an open relationship led to (confusing) emotional intimacy with a third person.

I truly doubt there are any chances for me and my ex fiancé to get back together right now. I do not even know if this is one-night feeling I'm having. But I'm trying to learn from this very painful experience and to understand as much as I can and this group seems to be really supportive, honest and empathic.

I know this was long but I couldn't find any thread that dealt with a similar situation and I guess this community will have some comments I can learn from.

Thanks for reading. I'm all ears now.

Have a great ending of 2016, everyone.",Asexual

can i ever get my friend back?,"I am grey-asexual or demisexual, I'm still questioning. Here's my issue: A few years ago, for my freshman year of college, I moved away and went to a large state university. I didn't have a car yet, moved into a dorm, in retrospect only did it because I was in an advanced high school program and it was what was expected of everyone in the program. Basically I didn't know anyone too well, so I started dating one of my friends who I did know (didn't go to the same university, but we had gone to the same high school and had been friends for a couple years at the time). Everything was ""perfect"", we were ""in love"", idk, but we dated for about four months. When the semester was over, he called me to break up with me because he was moving back home. At the time I had been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety issues, that he didn't know everything about, so the breakup made me even more depressed than before. I ended up letting my mental issues escalate and going a bit crazy-ex on him for the next year or so, didn't help that my already-existing mental issues led me to withdraw from the university and move back home as well. I ended up meeting someone new for a while and me and him (ex) had a long discussion about it and I ended up apologizing for doing all the crazy stuff (which I won't get into but basically we worked it out and remained friends.) Now here's the issue: he moved back to the town where we first started dating and is with this new girl. She absolutely hates me. I know for a fact that she made him delete and block my number because he tried to text me and catch up earlier this year and she sabotaged the text. I do the thing sometimes where I send texts to nowhere because I know he blocked me and I miss him, it's therapeutic in a sense idk. Anyway just last weekend I texted him that he was my best friend, I wish things hadn't have gotten weird and that I miss him. Thought it wasn't going to go anywhere due to the block, but I accidentally had my texts set up to send from my email so um, he got it. As I expected, the next day I got a facebook message from his new bitch girlfriend, the standard ""ummm why the fuck are you talking to (guy)? Everyone knows you're a stocker (spelled ""stalker"" wrong, v impressive/plus i'm not a stalker) and (guy) wants nothing to do with you"". I messaged back that I didn't understand why she had to hold grudges, I forget exactly what I said but it was decidedly more diplomatic than what she had said to me, just trying to keep the peace kind of thing. Of course she couldn't get past the fact that I was his ex and didn't listen to a word I said. Basically I miss my guy friend and wish we could communicate without her getting in the way. I'm moving up his way soon to finish school because a lot of my mental issues have gotten better and while I am happy for him, I do not want to waste my time trying to talk to this person in order to get through to him.

"Went off an antidepressant, and things are changing - ?","(So - warning for gross sex talk)

I've been taking Zoloft for the past year. Around the same time I also started testosterone (female to male trans). I've known I was asexual for a while now and I've always hated it. I was hoping the testosterone would awaken in me some sort of sexual attraction. Nope. Didn't happen. I continued having absolutely zero interest in sex. 

But I stopped taking the Zoloft about a week ago. Since then I have been pretty much constantly aroused. I even had 2 sex dreams, for the very first time ever! Wtf! And the sex dreams were kind of pleasurable?? Like.. in a physical way?? And I've been masturbating SO much - and damn it feels amazing. Like, 3 or 4 times a day. Previously, the idea of something going into my vagina was like mental nails on a chalkboard. I didn't want to even *imagine* it. But I've been experimenting with putting a finger up there and it's absolutely fantastic?? I don't know, it's strange. 

But at the same time, I don't want to have sex with anyone. I went on a date with someone last night and they slept in my bed and I felt awful because I had no desire to do anything except roll over and fall asleep. They were lying next to me in bed and we kissed a bit, and I just put an arm over them wondering what in the flying fuck I was supposed to do next in order to seem like a normal person. I ended up chirping, ""I have to wake up really early tomorrow!"" and jumped out of bed to turn off the light. In the morning, I woke up early and thought about a little fetish I have, and wished the person in my bed would leave so I could just masturbate to that. 

Anyway. I wonder if maybe I have a very, very small degree of sexual attraction but it's outweighed by social inhibitions, laziness, and fear (and previously the medication). If the attraction were stronger maybe it could poke through and actually drive me to have sex with someone. Or maybe I'm STILL trying frame my asexuality in an allosexual way. I don't know. I just know that being ace and aro makes me feel terribly cut off from everyone. 

(I know this is way too long to read, but I guess I'm just putting my thoughts out there. I don't know any ace or aro people in my real life.)",Asexual
I think I'm asexual,"I'm a 15 year old girl, and I think I'm asexual. I've had crushes before, but they've been purely romantic/sensual as far as I can tell. All the descriptions I've heard conflict with each other, but whenever I've had a crush I get flustered and nervous, etc. But if I ever think of sex, usually because it was mentioned or something, I get pretty uncomfortable. I'm just not interested.

I've told my best friend, and she's totally fine, but when I mentioned it to my mom, she got really upset and said that I shouldn't label myself and that it would probably come later. Do you have any tips on what I should do? I haven't brought it up again, and she hasn't mentioned it either, but I feel really badly knowing that she might be upset with me feeling this way.",Asexual
Aven and asexuality representation,"They present asexuality as a sexual orientation comparable to heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality, but at the same time, it seems more like a sub-category.

Like ""asexuality is a spectrum"", ""some asexuals have sex""...

In my opinion i think that most asexuals are in fact like heteros/homos/bi but not the point of being sexual like them, that's why it seems like a sub-category most of the time, and not a completely separate group like in my own case.

It is confusing.",Asexual

Asexual.,"I apologize about the title....I couldn't think of anything else before typing this. For the past few days...I've decided to come out as Ace and I'm starting to feel as if I'm not good enough. There have been instances where I had told women I were Asexual (when the topic of sex cane up of course)...and I've pretty much heard the same in terms of rejection. They either think something's wrong wit me or think I'm broken. I'm more of a Romance type of man. I don't mind being alone per se...but it would be nice to be in a relationship that isn't based on the 'we need to have sex in order to solidify/sex is important in a relationship.' I don't believe in the 'you haven't met the right person!' anymore until it happens. 

I know this isn't as well put together as it needs to be...but I'm just trying to explain how I feel. Not trying to garner pity/sympathy either but it's just frustrating is all. Thank you all for taking the time out to read.",Asexual
"""You'll change your mind once you actually have children""","So I'm just gonna say it; i really dislike children. I don't like being around them, hearing about them or seeing the 26252nd picture of your cousin twice removed's daughter. However, if I am at a family gathering or something and the kids there want to play with me I will. I am fine with them for a few hours but I never wanted to have children on my own, even when everybody else in school liked to play house. My relatives' kids are fine because they have some relevance to my life and I don't see them very often.

What really bothers me though is people telling me that I will change my mind once I have children on my own. I don't really tell people I am ace (and sex repulsed) because they wouldn't understand anyway and I feel like me having to explain it would result in me trying to slap/punch/stab them. I know most people here would just think I am mentally ill and talk bad about it behind my back because that's how out society is.

But it bothers me SO MUCH that everybody just assumes that I will totally have children at one point and that I will grow to really love children. I know that I won't but I can't exactly go ""ok listen, I am never gonna have sex with anybody because the thought is just incredibly gross to me and last time I checked I wasn't chosen by an angel/the Force to give birth to our Lord and saviour; therefore I would kindly ask you to stfu"", so I wanted to ask how you deal with this situation? I am sure many of you know what i am talking about, especially the women in this sub. I would really like something to shut them up because me insisting that hey, I probably know myself a bit better than somebody who has known me for like, an hour, and knowing that I won't change my mind usually ends with the other person looking smug and mumbling something along the lines of ""You'll see."".",Asexual
Yet Another Coming Out Story...,"So I'm writing this, mostly because I need to get it out.

I'm 28 now.

I knew I was asexual back in high school. When I was 17, I had a friend that asked me, after I confronted them about a lot of shit that was happening. My school thought I was gay. My friend asked, and I said I felt asexual. I didn't even realize that was a thing people could be. I just didn't care.

I've had sex w/ guys. It's meh.

I've masturbated. It's...meh.

I have come to care deeply about certain people. Some don't reciprocate. Some want more than I can give. It's a thing.

I had someone confess their interest in me. As soon as I mentioned the asexual thing they bailed. Either they were only interested in sex, or they didn't care to hear my thoughts. Either way, not attractive.

I've been drawn to guys, and I've been drawn to girls. It's never been sexual...always based on the person/the personality.

I've had people that understand. They've never pushed themselves or anyone else onto me. I appreciate that.

And I've also come to understand that I'll likely be alone. Not because there aren't people like me out there, or that there are not people that can be w/ asexuals out there, but because I need to be a friend w/ someone first. 

Everyone I'm friends w/, they either move faster than I ever could, or they will never bend my way (usually I've chosen poorly/made my move while under the influence, they aren't to blame)

All in all, this isn't meant to be a point to gather pity. I just needed to get things out.

I am who I am. People that want to change that can go fuck themselves.

People who accept that I welcome as friends.

Maybe I'll find someone more among those friends, I don't know.

Maybe not...but I won't sacrifice myself along the way.

"Low 30's HL/ Average L with late 20's LL/ new questioning asexual, 3 years relationship and I have a question.","Hello everyone, been lurking for a few weeks after my girlfriend of three years recently revealed to me that she may be asexual after I've been bringing up the issue of a lack of intimacy/desire? Sex is not painful for her, I've asked, and I believe her. She has no problems becoming aroused after I initiate, but I always have to be the one to initiate. She is willing to have sex, but indicated that it's a ""chore,"" which makes me feel like crap because I don't want to be having sex with someone against their will since I would feel terrible. Consent is huge in my book, and even the idea that I may breach that line terrifies me.

I think I'm at least average libido, and to me, sex is one expression of love and helps me bond with her, which I've explained, and I've been trying to understand her different mind set on it. I'm trying to come to terms that she may never ""want"" me the way I try to show affection to the one I love, and it's eating me alive. I love her, and the emotional aspect of our relationship is great. I love spending time with her, but the physical aspect is lacking in that she seems to not care for it as much or at all. 

Anyway, in living together for over a year, and during our talks, I noticed that she doesn't masturbate that often, only a few times a year. In trying to understand that she may be asexual, I began to wonder what would even spark her desire to masturbate, even occasionally at all?

Do asexuals ever have fantasies about anything to help with masturbating?
Is it difficult to masturbate without an innate sexual desire?
Why masturbate at all if there is no desire?

I'm trying to understand more and be as loving as possible. Please help.",Asexual
What do I say/do?,"So I posted here yesterday asking about some specifics to the ace community. After telling my partner that I really do identify as this and trying to explain what it means he became offended and put off. He's upset because I don't experience sex the same way he does and that I don't ""crave him"" like he does me even though I told him we could still have sex. He says I've changed even though I don't feel I have just by accepting what I am. He was visibly upset and somewhat colder during the rest of the conversation. Have any of you experienced a come out like this? What would say/ or do in a situation like this? ",Asexual

Confused,"First, can asexuals have sex? 
I solely have sex to make my partner happy I don't actually ever want it myself. If I never had sex ever again I really wouldn't care. 
Second, can asexuals mastrubate? 
If it's just for the feeling of an orgasm is the person asexual? ",Asexual
Here's something funny that had happened to me because of my asexuality,"So I'm with a friend walking to subway, so this guy comes out of subway wearing a tight tank top, and my friend is like damn did you see him.

Sometimes I wish I wasn't asexual,"Sometimes I feel unique for it but other times I feel like I'm broken. I started to realize I was asexual around 11th grade because I started to put the pieces together why I didn't want a boyfriend and why the topic of sex and kissing made me cringe. 

I should be feeling lonely because I've never had a boyfriend or first kiss and I'm almost 21, but for some reason I don't feel anything and I don't really care about dying alone. But sometimes I wish it wasn't like that because it must be nice being in love but my brain can't fathom the topic of love. ",Asexual
[m17]Kinda confused about my orientation(need answers),"I have felt like this for years, and it has never changed, and I want to know what it exactly is.

I'm pretty sure I'm a bi grey aromantic because the last time I was interested in a girl was when I was 10, and I had 2 crushes on girls at the same time, but both the feelings went away, and I just forgot about those crushes until the subject of crushes came up.

6 months or so ago, I had a crush on some guy band member who I seemed to idolise and I felt like I knew him personally, like what an asexual person needs to have attraction but the thing is I feel like I'd be called ""grey"" because that basically just means somewhere in the middle of aromantic and romantic. 

I only realised that was a crush(though a platonic, very short one) 2 fucking weeks ago though, and at the time it felt like doing that was just ""normal"" for being in a fandom.

My sex drive has always been for guys, like how a bi person could like gay same-sex stuff mostly but have had occasional crushes to the opposite gender before, but nothing sexual. It does depend on the person though.
