"LGBT is not now, or ever will be, accepting peadophiles.","Hello all people. There has been recently a lot of posts, caused by some rather questionable images claiming that LGBT is adding a P for peadophiles, or the MAP stuff. This could not be further from the truth, This is a hoax being spread by 4chan, as you can see on the snopes page [here](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lgbtp-adding-letter/).  However, due to this hoax, we have been receiving multiple posts a day, either claiming we are, asking are we, or simply repeating our denial. To this effect we are putting up this sticky, and asking people do not keep posting such, further posts will be removed and referred to this sticky, thankyou.",lgbt
Don't PM individual mods about issues on /r/lgbt - ModMail is there for you!,"Hi everyone!

The eagle-eyed of you may have noticed a new rule on our sidebar this morning!

&gt; Rule 4: Do not Private Message individual moderators about issues on /r/lgbt, use the **[modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt&amp;subject=&amp;message=)** instead. This will help you get a better response faster.

This is because of all the different time zones our moderator team cover, you're more likely to get a response from us quickly if you message the entire team using modmail, than if you message one or more of us individually.

We will be holding people to this rule after a number of recent incidents where mods have faced harassment and even abuse in PMs. 

To send us a Modmail, go to compose a message as you normally would, but just send it to ""/r/lgbt"" rather than an individual user.

There is a very insufficient amount of outrage from our cis-LGB brothers and sisters today.,"[In case you haven‚Äôt heard, the US government just erased transgender people from all of their official pages online.](https://medium.com/@Phaylen/all-references-to-transgender-americans-scrubbed-from-government-websites-45a455259e4c?fbclid=IwAR3FYodeNItQCcC0f3LamUv9U1_F0GnsVhz_HQQbp81bErxeVBmVhCumkyc)This is a very frightening move that can and will trigger a house of cards effect on ALL LGBT rights. 

Currently the top post for today at around 15-16k upvotes is showing outrage that r/relationships removed a post from their subreddit because the people involved were in a same-sex relationship. Although that is worthy of rage, it should not be eclipsing the shocking news coming out of the White House today.

To log onto this subreddit as a trans person today is colossally upsetting. We‚Äôre terrified today, and our cis-LGB friends are not here for us in our time of need. And it feels really shitty, everybody. Really shitty. ",lgbt

If being LGBT was a choice I wouldn‚Äôt take it,"Before you come at me, I am saying this because I‚Äôm tired of people calling my sexuality a choice and having no where to vent out. 

If being lesbian was a choice, I would rather remain straight even though I would still support the lgbtq movement. 

Being lesbian means that I cannot fall in love and have the joy of introducing my loved one to my country and to my family. 

It also means that I have to make a choice of staying close to my family or starting up a new life where I‚Äôm open about my sexuality. So if my love interest screws me over, then my family is not there to help me. 

It also means having an interest in someone, but acknowledging that they might be straight or they might just want to ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù. 

My country is one of the worst place to be lgbt. Lesbians are raped, gay and trans people are murdered. Some are sentenced to life in prison if they are caught, and until recently most were being executed. 

I constantly hear my family belittle the LGBT movement, and even though I try to show my support, I‚Äôm afraid that one slip of the tongue and I‚Äôm done for.  It‚Äôs not just paranoia. Last year, they started questioning my friendship with my best friend. It was hell, the ridicules, the cries and the prayers. The derogatory WhatsApp messages from my friends. It was so horrible that I ended up in a heterosexual relationship, because I wasn‚Äôt strong and brave enough to come out. 

I love my family, I really do. However, not all of them will accept me if I do come out. I don‚Äôt want to seem weird or out of place. I just want to be like them. I don‚Äôt want to censor my social media and plan my Love life is secrecy, because I‚Äôm not strong enough to face the consequences. I want to share my frustrations with them, my heart break and joys with them. I have an extended family and they‚Äôre the only people I‚Äôm really close to, but I feel like an imposter...Like a disappointment irdk how to describe it.

Experience working with refugees as a trans woman,"Hey all, 

just a little story I wanted to share with all of you, especially with all the BS that‚Äôs going on in the UK, the US, Brazil and all over the world. 

I work for an organization that works with refugees in Berlin, Germany. We run shelters, community centers, registration centers etc. and most of our guests and visitors come from predominantly muslim countries, most speak arabic, farsi or russian. They have all kinds of backgrounds, levels of education, age etc. 

I am a visible trans woman, only sometimes pass on first glance from a distance as long as I don‚Äôt speak. I have been full time for the last 8 months and on HRT for 6 weeks. I am open about being trans and open about being a lesbian.

Even though from my work experience as well as my academic background, I knew it shouldn‚Äôt be too big of an issue, in the beginning I was a scared of presenting as my authentic self, of asking people to call me by my name etc. Even though I knew it was BS, subconsciously the stereotypes and fear mongering still had an effect on me. 

Here is my list of actually bad experiences I have had over the past 8 months, working full time with refugees every day all day:

 

That‚Äôs it. I know I have been lucky, I know I am in situations where there is a very clear power imbalance that protects me, I know this is not representative of all similar situations. But this is my lived experience. 

In over 8 Months and thousands of people I worked with, there have not been any actually bad experiences. Some people don‚Äôt quite understand right away, some are confused what to call me. A lot of people need a quick explanation because they feel insecure and don‚Äôt pick up on what‚Äôs going on right away. 

On the other hand, I have been met with an incredible amount of kindness, understanding, support and acceptance. Both from men* and women* and anything in between, from younger and older folks, religious and secular people, the amount of positivity and understanding delights me again and again. 

Women* wearing a hijab take it off in front of me, talk to me like any other women*, mothers let me play with their children, men* are friendly and respectful but treat me in a clearly gendered way, children call my Laura and ask me to braid their hair or play with them. 

All of this is normal. All of this should not be surprising at all. People who have arrived as refugees in the past few years treat me just like people who have been living here longer, who were born here etc. People calling themselves Christian, Muslim or Atheist treat me the same (actually I had to argue with several more people who felt like their (christian) faith gave them the right to question my identity than anything else).

I didn‚Äôt write this post because any of the above is special or surprising. But soooooo many people have asked me about my experience, soooooo many people assume I would face discrimination and harassment, homophobia and transmisogyny at a higher level or frequency than with people who aren‚Äôt recent refugees, who aren‚Äôt of muslim faith, who aren‚Äôt people of color. 

Anyways, I just felt like sharing my experience with you, especially in a time like this. 

Be kind to each other and have a lovely day,

Laura",lgbt

Two Trans Girls: Travelled Across the Country Broke n Scared,"I just crossed the country from Florida to Utah in an old beat up Corolla with my girlfriend and $30 to my name.

   The trip took about a week in total of non-stop driving, only stopping to sleep in our car and eat. We ended up sleeping in 100¬∞F+ temperatures in Jacksonville with no AC and stayed in Wyoming where it got down to the teens with no heating.

  The past few months have been literal hell on earth. My dad, who before I came out was already very hot-headed and abusive, took a 180¬∞ and in March when I told him I was transgender he lost all patience with me. We fought and argued nearly every single day and when my girlfriend came to Florida to stay with me all shit hit the giant, proverbial fan. It started out with lots of yelling and name calling. He always refused to call me Nicole and would purposely call my girlfriend, who is full time trans, ‚Äòboy‚Äô and ‚Äòfreak‚Äô and ‚Äòit‚Äô all the fucking time. Stuff started getting out of hand when physical violence started breaking out against me and my girlfriend.

  At first my reaction to him getting in her face was violent and I ended up getting the shit kicked out of me on my birthday this last August. My uncle, who was staying at the house for free while we payed rent, and my father shoved me over the corner of a table which injured my back very severely and made it hard to walk for a couple weeks. I was covered in blood from him punching my face and I was basically bruised everywhere.

   After that I was just angry all the time. I was working 2 jobs when this happened, totalling about 70 hours a week. It was so much stress and anger built up inside me that it still irritates me to this day. About a month later, in September, 2018, we got in another fight. I was paying him to keep me on his insurance since it was cheaper and I was always flat broke due to how much rent he wanted from me and my girlfriend.

   Well, on the 4th he cancelled that insurance and my car was the only way to get to my work since there was no public transportation to it (kinda lived in Nowhere Land, Florida-- not a lot of buses) and it was 20 miles away. I confronted him about it and basically told him he was entrapping me in that house by taking all my money.

   Well, he didn't like that all too much and he ended up pushing and grabbing me again and it started a fight, except this time I won. He ended up calling the cops and they took his side, of course, him being a combat veteran and all. In their eyes I was a 21 year old adult male who was a danger to him. Even though he's the one that's laidlayed his hand on me since I was 9 years old. 

   After I went to jail... my life had basically fallen apart. My girlfriend ended up having to work full time to help support us since the 2 days I spent in jail lost me both of my jobs. A little while after that my car broke down and I was really, really depressed. I ended up trying to swallow a bottle of pills and a bottle of Jack Daniel's after the court dropped the charges on me and my probation ended. Luckily I survived.


 I didn't end up doing it obviously. I thought of a better plan. I ended up filming my dad abusing us and sending it to my girlfriend's mom and brother who live in Utah. Well, nevertheless, they were appalled by what they saw going on to their sister/daughter and me. Her mom told us to pack our things and gtfo of there that night that I sent the videos, so we did. We left that house with the clothes on our backs in a crappy corolla we got in at midnight and never looked back once. We ended up traveling from Florida all the way to Utah with $30 to our names and somehow made it. 

   Well, now that we're here, we still need some help. We came here to make a better life for ourselves but we are flat broke. Like 10 bucks and a pack of skittles broke. I need 32 dollars to get a new ID here in Utah to make it easier to get a decent job out here. Also our car has no gas left and we haven't eaten in about 4 days. I'm starting to feel sick from hunger pains and my girlfriend felt nauseous and dizzy this morning due to the lack of food and being trapped here. We only have till December to move out of here and I'm not sure how we're going to pull that off.

   I've never struggled this hard in my life, it feels like I've started over in a new place without any head start. Literally starting again from nothing. I even had to leave my wig and hormones in Florida and I've felt super dysphoric everyday I've been here. We're looking to get enough money to be able to comfortably get our lives back together and be able to have enough time and energy to look for jobs

My bf (23M) is more scared that I (24F) will run off with a girl,"For context: I am the B from lgbt.

My boyfriend from 9 months sometimes 'casually' mentions that I will pull a 'Carol' (for those unfamiliar with Friends, she married a guy but discoveres she is gay in that marriage). He jokingly says it, but he has said it multiple times that I'm starting to think he feels challenged by my bisexuality. Not sure if he feels challenged overall or just by my sexuality, even though I am not even looking at other people. 

Is it me or do guys feel challenged by bi girls?",lgbt
Finally started coming out to my core group of friends! I'm finally out!,"It's been a whirlwind of a weekend. I'm in a college mens fraternity and have found myself to be in a safe enough place to finally start speaking about being queer, but I've hesitantly kept my secret for years from anyone that sees me on a regular basis. 

I took my first international trip this summer and after a few really important growing experiences, I've been realizing that I'm the only one who's keeping me in the closet. So I have challenged myself to start to come out and live authentically with my friends around me. I don't really like the whole ""Hey, I have something I want to tell you"" conversation, so I have had a hard time actually coming out unless I'm asked about it. But given my environment, a room full of frat boys aren't gonna know how to just ask if I was gay. 

But Saturday night comes along and I ended up drinking quite a bit more vodka than I typically allow myself, and I really became acquainted with why they call it liquid courage. Mid black out, I catch myself thinking a little more clearly and I catch what I'm talking about, and I've just clearly outed myself in a room full of my closest friends. I don't really remember exactly how it was received, but I can't help but feel a deep relief and happiness that I'M FINALLY OUT! 

It got better. I never thought it would, but it did. I can't believe I'm out. 

Keep safe, strong, and hopeful.",lgbt
What do I do now?,"I am posting this from a new account cause I don't want my friends to see it. I am 52. My husband , with whom I have been for 23 years left me two years ago over some young guy he fell for. I was devastated and crashed on the inside. I was so hurt and I still am. Driven by insane rage I went to their home after they got married, 10 months ago and I did a huge scene which ended up with them calling the police. I was taken to a cell.  When I went out I was told they hadn't pressed charges against me. Then I went home and tried to hang myself. I was saged by a huge coincidence when a friend of mine that lives in the flat over me heard me come home and stopped by to see me( I don't lock the door during the day and I didn't think to do it then). I was then forced to do therapy and some stupid anti depressants that have 0 effect. I have changed 4 therapists but things still seem as desperate as they were when I first started. They keep telling me some lame clich√®s or turning every statement I make into a question about ""how did that make you feel"" or some other shit. I feel so broken and alone. How could he just leave me like that, like everything we had meant nothing. And I still love him so fuckin much. And he is out there happy with this new guy and I am thrown away like rubbish. I am so sad honestly.",lgbt

Coming out,"I don‚Äôt know if I should post this here but I feel very conflicted so... Sorry if this ain‚Äôt in the right place.

I‚Äôm 17M and I‚Äôve accepted that I am gay for the past while now, and I love it! The thing is, I‚Äôm not out and I want to.

I‚Äôve told a few close friends and I can be myself around them but others I feel so sheltered. I want to be able to be free but the thought of telling my parents brings a sense of disgust over me for some reason. My family finding out seems so daunting to me and I don‚Äôt like it. I feel like I‚Äôd be fine with the world knowing.

I feel as though I‚Äôve missed so many oppurtunitys straight people have had because I haven‚Äôt been able to experience so many things. Life is so short and I‚Äôm scared that once I hit like 30 or something I‚Äôll be undesirable in the community if I don‚Äôt have a permanent partner by then. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to go about coming out and how to deal with those other thoughts of mot finding someone or being forgotten about. Thank you!",lgbt
How do I come out to my gf,"So for a bit of background, I am 16, 17 in a few weeks, and I think I‚Äôm gay, or at least bi. I‚Äôve been in a dedicated relationship for a few months with the best person I have ever known in my entire life. I love her more than anything but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling I‚Äôm getting. To test the waters a little, I secretly installed Grindr, and spent a few hours on there, chatting with guys and such. Of course this is probably illegal, especially considering I lied about my age to actually get on the app, but I really had to know.

I was turned on, actively. 

So now I face this dilemma, do I come out to my girlfriend, or is this just a hormones thing? In the past we‚Äôve joked about threesomes with other guys and girls and she‚Äôs made it very clear that she would not really be into polygamy, especially with a guy.

My Best Friend is Transphobic and I Don't Know What to Do,"So, first things first, I'm not transgender, but I am bi (she knows this) and a supporter for transgender rights. Also, this may be triggering for some so if you're not comfortable reading this I totally understand and you don't have to help me. And this is going to be really long, so sorry. Excuse any typos. 

I've (F/17) known my friend (F/17), let's call her Cas, doesn't agree with transgenders and the people who fall under that umbrella for some time now, but due to my reluctance and fear of losing Cas as a friend I haven't really brought it up again. It has always bothered me though, to the point where I'm literally thinking about it all the time and getting angry at myself for not doing anything about it. 

Well, recently, I've gotten this crush on a person, let's call them Lee, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns. I really wanted to tell someone about them, but my family is obviously not an option since I don't talk to them about this stuff, so I turned to Cas. I texted her and told her about Lee and that they're nonbinary (they're out) and showed her a picture of them. 

Everything was fine, but as we continued texting, I realized that Cas kept using she/her for Lee even though I told her they use gender neutral pronouns. At first I didn't I say anything; whenever she texted ""she/her"" I just corrected her by sending ""*they/them‚Äù back. (This probably isn't important, but we live like an hour away from each other so all of our communication is from text). Over the course of like a week this kept happening without Cas even attempting to correct herself and I got fed up and said ""Girl if you don't start using their correct pronouns I'm gonna shove my foot up your ass."" Yeah yeah I know it's aggressive, but I was really angry and it's not like I was actually gonna shove my foot up her ass. Maybe. 

This is what she texted back, y'all ready? 
""I don‚Äôt believe in pronouns and I don‚Äôt know her. If I met her I‚Äôm not gonna go and call her her I‚Äôd just call her by her name but it‚Äôs extremely unlikely so I‚Äôm not gonna call her something I don‚Äôt believe in. She‚Äôs clearly a girl""

I just- 

""I dont believe in pronouns""

??? 

Not only is this completely a dick thing to say, but it's also incredibly single minded. I'm gonna bullet point her thoughts below (prepared to be enraged and maybe also a little confused cause you bet your sweet asses I am). 

‚Ä¢ She doesn't believe in gender neutral pronouns
‚Ä¢ She only believes in he or she
‚Ä¢ She doesn't think she needs to use their correct pronouns or take the time to remember 
‚Ä¢ If she offends anyone, she won't apologize because she's not sorry
‚Ä¢ Just because using their incorrect pronouns makes them uncomfortable doesn't make it wrong 
‚Ä¢ She thinks that the fact that people feel the need to feel like a boy or girl based on behavior is pushing a gender inequality agenda and that it's a real problem
‚Ä¢ She sees transgenders and nonbinaries are conforming to the stereotypes of how a man or woman are supposed to act
‚Ä¢ She thinks people see gender dysphoria and transgender/nonbinary as a trend
‚Ä¢ She thinks people shouldn't make changes to their bodies for life; that it's a bad decision, saying people should prioritize long term over short term effects (little background on this one: she's seen videos where people have transitioned and regretted it)

Okay now heres some other stuff she said that is hard for me to understand cause its really long and I have a hard time reading and understanding long texts (which is hypocritical cause this is long, I know). I'm going to just quote here for you. And when I say long, I mean LONG. 

‚Ä¢ ""It‚Äôs so hard to find good evidence for this bc there has been so little research done for the other side other than the ancient cruel ways that are equivalent to the pray the gay away bs but I‚Äôll explain what I know. So, their brains have an imbalance of estrogen v testosterone that usually fall in line with the 2 genders (why females act more feminine usually and males act more masculine usually). This imbalance is so significant that the male mind is average of female (types of intelligence, instinct, behavior etc) and vice versa. But this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue if we take away male and female gender roles. When we put them in, the gender dysphoria is introduced and back then was punished so severely just like sexuality diff. Today in many places in the world and some parts of the US it is still not accepted. If you are more girly/boyish than the gender standards allow you might be stereotyped and ridiculed. Also it‚Äôs with going with the crowd. People try to fit in. When you‚Äôre not like the other boys and girls that‚Äôs another push of ‚Äúwhy do I think this? I must be in the wrong body.‚Äù There is no wrong body. Now we clearly agree on this. And when they said ‚Äúmy mind is not my body‚Äù it is true in a sense but not literally. The right body = what is ideal for their culture and values not actual male and female body which should not matter in line with personality and behavior. Now hormone treatment is something I‚Äôve been trying to look up but in the oppo way. It‚Äôs common to treat trans by giving them more of the hormone of their ideal mindset and the oppo gender. What if they put more testosterone in men wanting to be female or estrogen in females that want to be men? And there are other hormones than just those 2 but I‚Äôm just gonna use E and T to generalize that group of + female hormones and + male under E and T. I‚Äôve been researching this tactic to see if it‚Äôs possible, which it should be since it‚Äôs already in your body and you can do the opposite very well and it has great effects even slowing puberty in men and physically changing the body of men by stopping penis, hair, and even causing them to form female nipples. The same goes for more T in women. They get more hair, voice change for both,  boob growth, and both have crucial mood and behavioral changes. Can having more T types of hormones in men with GD and more E types of hormones with GD help? Has it been tried? If you find this info pls let me know bc I think it can be a much better alternative. And ofc therapy has been a large effort for ages, but what about an effective de-GDing that doesn‚Äôt help transition to another gender or just complete discrimination and mistreatment of the person for what they think, but getting to the root of why they feel the need to change just bc they have the mind of a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù/‚Äúman‚Äù (it‚Äôs in ‚Äú‚Äù bc when I say this I mean the standard of these genders that‚Äôs been set for centuries all around the world). Our bodies should not = us as in be ourselves even if it‚Äôs not the norm. This type of mindset is promoted for other mental disorders as well. Also having a simplicity of genders is so important. The promotion of ‚ÄúIf you feel not you, you need to change‚Äù and I mean drastic change of body and/or actions is causing more issues and more mental disorders to diffuse and grow. Kids are literally having identity crises who weren‚Äôt confused before or suffering from GD. Like I said. Transitioning etc are short term effects. It‚Äôs like a hydra. You cut off one head, then more will pop up. We need to target long term, and this goes for most situations and issues in the world tbh. Too much emphasis and credit is being placed on short term. If I offend anyone so be it. I‚Äôm worried about the overall than just certain groups and individuals. I still am looking into everything. What I believe will likely change and be added onto overtime with more info and research being done, but what‚Äôs going on rn is not as effective as they say it is. Gender and gender identity are 2 separate things. Gender is simple. Biological. But gender identity is complex and is becoming more complex by avoiding things and creating even more hypotheticals that don‚Äôt solve much. Yes peoples feelings and emotions will be hurt, but they already are. You must feel pain to gain. Success rarely comes instantly, if ever, without failures.""

‚Ä¢ ""Back to confusion and gender identity crisis: people are being told to be themselves and ignore all biological gender behavior. Not all gender discrimination is bad. Here‚Äôs the definition of discrimination cuz discrimination has been thought to be a synonym of oppression (prolonged cruel mistreatment) always. It can be a synonym relating to oppressive prejudice, but it is also the recognition of distinguishing something from another. Men and women are biologically different from our brains to our bodies that relate to capabilities. There‚Äôs a large range and some outliers, but again it‚Äôs outliers (ex: people with gender dysphoria are outliers biologically bc of the hormones in their brain). This is the minority (also has negative connotation now bc it‚Äôs associated with racism and oppression, but it‚Äôs not always bad; a minority is simply the smaller portion of a group). Anyways back to the point. Oppressive gender standards are recognized as a problem. But they are generalized to be all gender standards and gender discrimination actually is a better term for what I‚Äôm trying to say. So, recognition of our physical and mental capacities in relation to common gender traits or uncommon gender traits is okay. But the oppression of being different is not. But they are being treated as one and the same. We should accept ourselves and our differences, similarities, strengths, and weaknesses. By ignoring gender all together, the intent is again to ignore the standards and oppression, but it‚Äôs also pushing back a part of your identity. You may be ok but it‚Äôs not going to last forever. Plus you influence others around you and which is what is most worrisome. Young people are ignoring their bodily needs. They need to recognize their gender to treat their bodies right. It‚Äôs why women have periods and men don‚Äôt. Why men and women grow at different rates etc. Pronouns should not be offensive. That means that if you‚Äôre so offended by a simple pronoun, how will you handle recognizing it for what you need to have a healthy body (physically and mentally). There are different requirements for what we should eat, drink, do etc bc of gender biologically. It‚Äôs good to be separating oppressive  standards from gender, but you must be able to recognize it as well. Pronouns are so insignificant. Who you are is not a pronoun. Who you are is you.""

I'm not asking you guys to explain what she meant, but I added them cause you guys probably will be able to read all of that without your brain immediately shutting off and that bitch takes forever to reboot.  

And I know this may be weird, but I'm offended in a way. I'm, of course, offended for transgender/nonbinary people, but I'm also kind of taking this personally. I tell her I have a crush on Lee and if I actually do anything about it they could end up my significant other, and she can't even respect me or Lee enough to use their pronouns. And she knows I'm part of the LGBT+ community, but she doesn't even try to look at this from the other person's perspective. I don't know, I feel like I'm being kind of selfish there. 

Anyway, what do you guys think I should do? I've already discussed each bullet point with her, but she's still adament about her opinions. To be honest, as part of the LGBT+ community and just being an ally in general, I don't know if I'm comfortable with still being her friend. The problem is that we've been best friends for seven years and she's literally my only friend (that is not an exaggeration; the only people I talk to are her and my family. Yes I'm aware that's sad, don't @ me). I don't know if I'm ready to let that go, but I'm starting to think it's the only thing left to do, because she's incredibly stubborn in general and I know I can't change her mind about this.  

Also, she's kind of weird about LGBT+ in general, like she says she's fine with LGB, but just the things she says sometimes and I get this vibe from her. Not going to go into depth with that as this is already too long. 

I just think that if a person is happy and they're not hurting anyone, including themselves, then good for them. ",lgbt

Family privacy issues regarding the internet [Rant],"So hello, r/LGBT, I'm Amber. I have an issue that I partially want whatever input I can get on and also just wanting to lowkey whine about it, and since r/LGBTeens kept removing my post, so I‚Äôm here. So here goes.

Ever since I got a iPod in middle school, pretty much my parents and brother have been, to say the least, monitoring me. They've been doing so beforehand too of course, listening in to verbal conversations when my friends were over, even real late at night. Now, of course, I understand that it's important for there to be limits and trust and stuff and it's okay for them to check in to make sure I'm not being harassed or catfished or something by some weird stranger or having/sending nudes, but this evolved into a very, very different category.

Since I was younger I knew that they did this and got a bit paranoid. I never did much wrong, like I didn't do anything of the above, but they still lectured and punished me for things that maybe weren't totally wrong, like dark jokes or me cursing in texts every now and then, but of course this was relatively reasonable as I was younger. But it's continued a lot now.

I know my parents still check my phone every now and then because every few days I check my open apps and see just about all of them. They check my images, deleted and otherwise, all of my apps (even the games) and search history. Luckily I'm asexual so they haven't seen any porn yet, but at the same time, I'm (probably) trans and that's mostly what this is about.

A little but ago I started using Discord to communicate with a few online friends, people that I'm relatively emotionally close to but still remain cautious with (I don't share last name, the state I live in, age, anything like that). I tended to emotionally rely on these people a lot, as well as bringing my real life friends into the group, and my parents started to realize that I wasn't having conversations on iMessage anymore. After a while I came out to my friends as trans over there with the help of one of my trans friends and THIS is where things get messy.

I had to start deleting discord every now and then because I knew my parents wouldn't approve of me being trans. They got more and more in-depth with their checking, literally randomly grabbing my phone out of my hands sometimes, instantly getting suspicious when I type for more than two minutes and checking, forcing me to hand it over whenever I laugh at anything (usually stupid memes). Finally, once they figured out what I was using to communicate, in the middle of the school day I found my discord pretty much hacked by them. Now keep in mind due to just general paranoia and how they acted towards LGBT people, etc, this was my nightmare, literally, I had actually had nightmares about this.

I got my friends to kick me from sensitive channels but they still found out. Later that week my mom forcibly outed me to my family, told me to never talk to any people online, which is the biggest fuck-you I've ever received because my brother is underage just like me and he MET his damn girlfriend online and went to her in person, which is a big-ass no-go for me. And not just that, but they (mostly my mom) read things that she had no business in, regarding people I cared about. Relationship issues, personal secrets, insecurities, all of those things my friends TRUSTED me to keep private and secret were instantly known by my whole family. Hell, my mother still brings up those things in conversation. And whenever I try to ask her to be a little less invasive, just a little less, mind you, and I have tried, she always hits me with the same thing: ""Why, do you have something to hide?"" And the answer is three things: yes, but I don't say that, and also that even if I didn't I'd still be pissed as hell and offended at what is basically an insult to my intelligence, and lastly, I guarantee she wouldn't like it if i did the same thing. What's even worse is that just about any time I bring it up she instantly gets suspicious as hell and usually takes my phone minutes after and is on full hawk mode for the rest of the week.

And worst part is, I haven't even gotten any progression. My parents don't want me to transition and will make my life hell for attempting to do so. My brother's an absolute ass about it saying that he's disgusted I'm trans, or, in his definition, a ""mentally ill faggot"".

So now whenever I text or type or reference something about communication my mother instantly perks up and goes all ""you haven't been going to \*\*Discord\*\* have you, \*\*Nathan\*\*?"" And of course, even though it's true and I have been, I have to say no, because I can't take everyone's secrets being public in my family life again, and I can't handle my parents being so disgusted or disappointed even though they pretend to be okay and willing to give me a choice even though I've HEARD their conversations late at night about how I'm not, I'm faking, it's just a phase.

And lastly? My brother, holy hell. He follows all my social media accounts, regularly checks my post and comment and like history and BRINGS UP to me things he disagrees with, while constantly being nitpicky about everything ever. I've tried blocking him but he makes more alts, and this is why this alternate account of mine EXISTS (even though I'm not sure if he sees this one or not). He also saw me use Discord once while peeking over my shoulder that he does every five seconds and LOVES to ""offhand"" mention me using it as loudly as possible so my parents find out but so he can also pass it as an accident.  And now I have to walk on eggshells around his (easily angered) ass and can't call him out on being an absolute sadistic douchebag without him ""accidentally"" leaking that I still use it or my post history, which he STATED he will do if I ""piss him off"". Luckily he hasn't done shit yet, but FUCK, I'm just getting salty talking about it right here.

"Casually mentioned my female crush to my parents, it went better than expected","I have a crush on a girl who's not ready for a relationship yet, but we're still friends. We're cool as friends, and I'm not hurt that I was kindly rejected.

My cousin recently got a boyfriend and she's been gushing over him. I'm happy for her, but my mom is just reminding me that since she has a boyfriend, ""when are you getting yours?"" She's acting like this because my cousin is 3 weeks older than me, so we're practically the same age

I've come out as lesbian to her before, but she shut me down and said to ""be more open minded"" and not limit myself to girls. (Mom how about you be more open minded instead of limiting yourself to guys? Yeah that's what I thought)

So when my mom brought my cousin's relationship up again, I tell her ""I got rejected from my crush, okay? I'm trying."" When my mom asked why, I said ""SHE said SHE wasn't ready for a relationship."" 

My mom hasn't bothered me since, and whenever I mention guys around my (very protective) dad, he seems a bit calmer knowing that I'm not into them.

I'm confused,"This is my first post here and I'm kind of upset it has to be a big vent. I'll give you some background information before diving into the problem.

I'm not exactly as old as some of the people on here. I'm only 13, I'm biologically female and as long as I can remember I've been saying I'm male. I live with my grandparents and they've always rejected the idea of me being trans. They were completely against it so I gave up and just let the feeling sit with me as I became more and more uncomfortable.

When I was 9, I went to Comic Con and was sat at the bar with my auntie, uncle and cousin and the conversation stuck up about gender identity, since my uncle is a mental health worker. I took the opportunity to come out as trans to them and they were very accepting and caring. They asked me what I wanted to change my name to and I chose Timothy because of the name of my favourite character from a game I like. They told me to bring it up with my grandparents, so I did as soon as I got home a few days later. They told me to stop lying and to stop hiding behind all the characters I like and just be me.

(This is dragging and I'm sorry) When I turned 11, I was so uncomfortable with my gender and my looks that I started to wear masks. I wore them 24/7 - even when I went to school I refused to take it off. It became clear to everyone that I had a problem with myself that needed a solution. I had very few close friends and I'd lost family members, making it even worse trying to show my face in public. I decided that my grandparents would never accept me and decided to come out as lesbian, which helped for a little while, but the feeling of being uncomfortable never left me.

I got with a girl when I came into secondary school, year 7 in May and I was confident to start with. She was the light of my life and she helped me get over my mask phase, but she became abusive later on and my confidence was, again, completely shattered. I left her and was broken. I had come out to her as trans and she had told me that I was just looked for attention from her. I finally came home sobbing to my grandparents that I wanted to die. I told them I've attempted to off myself more than once, I'd been self-harming and was done with life. They finally realised that they were wrong and I got my hair cut and my name changes within school to Leon, which I'm currently known as.

I'm sorry that dragged on, and you probably haven't read to here, but I have a problem. I'm getting confused again and uncomfortable with who I am.

I have a new girlfriend and she is 100% supportive of my transition. She helps me put on my binder, she shaves the side of my head when it needs doing, she helps me look more manly - everything I could ever want. But the one thing she can't stop is the constant bullying at school and in the streets. I get thrown slurs the second I leave the house, like ""trannie"" and ""freak"". I could cope with it but I got messaged over Instagram by another trans boy, saying I was confused and needed to stop myself.

I don't know whether he was right or not... I don't know what to think anymore. I'm scared, I'm crying, and I don't know whether if I turn back now, I'd even be accepted as a woman again. Can I please have some advice? I'm sorry this dragged on, I just needed to vent before I hurt myself again.",lgbt

I have some (probably ignorant) questions about trans people. I want to learn.,"Just a little background, I'm an advocate for lgbt rights (because ykno I'm a decent human) but I was raised very religious and indoctrinated with all that bullshit (gay people are gross, trans people are ill, etc) but throughout high school I started becoming more liberal within my religion and ended up leaving the religion entirely about a year ago. Now I'm a super happy atheist and I'm really passionate about being a voice for good now, but I want to be educated about the communities so I can be the best ally I can.

My biggest question is this: is transgender about gender or sex? I know that it's essentially being a different sex between the ears than between the legs, but it seems in my experience like it's more about gender expression, or not falling into a gender role.

If there were no female/male gender roles (men were just as comfortable being nurturing as being strong, women were just as accepted as leaders as as followers and mommies, every store was unisex and men wore dresses sometimes and women wore ties sometimes and there were no gendered toys and everything was for everyone) would you still feel like you were born with the wrong anatomy? Is it something everyone in the trans community even agrees on?  For instance, if you're mtf, do you think youd feel the exact same about yourself if you could dress and present yourself as a woman without anyone giving a damn? 

Can you be transgender but, like, cissexual? Where you present as the opposite gender but have no desire to change your anatomy?

I am trying to be blatant and clear, but I want yall to know I harbor no animosity or judgement. I want you guys to be accepted as you are, and I think a big part of that is asking questions so I can understand better. If anything was unclear or rude, let me know and I'll try to clarify.",lgbt

He's kind of a huge achiever tbh (which impresses me a lot). And the fact that he's kind of smart, and doesn't let state-sanctioned homophobia get to him really impresses me tbh. Judging from that, I think we'd get along pretty well tbh.

Only thing is, he's studying in another country.  (He's 20, I'm 18). Question is, how do I even begin talking to him without sounding like a pretentious stalker? I mean he is kind of cute and all. But is there no chance of me to know him at all? Even as a friend or role model? I'm lost and confused tbh. Really would love some advice on this.

TL;DR: I have a crush on someone (a local) studying overseas. How do I initiate contact with him? (since I admire him as a person and also have a crush on him too)

A dumb question about identity,"Hi, sorry if this isn't allowed. I will post in another sub if recommended. 

Basically I'm struggling with my identity, as I always have. I was born as a cisgender female. I don't want to be male. Being called ""sir"" accidentally makes my skin crawl. But I don't exactly feel like a ""ma'am"". I feel like I'm more towards the middle of the spectrum. Still very ok with female pronouns but don't really feel like a true woman. 

Is this along the lines of agender or just an androgynous female? Is it even an LGBT issue? Am I considered queer for this? Or am I just a tomboy plain and simple? 

I'm trying to read as much as I can on the subject but I feel stuck until I can pin a label onto myself (I hate labels).

A Ranty Type Question," 

Hello everyone!

I'm a closeted 20 year old Bi guy. Of late I've kinda been noticing that even though Women show interest in me(not bragging lol) I somehow seem to reject them and not consider any idea of a relationship. I'm mostly into Women but like Men too especially Dick( Sorry if it's TMI lol). When I decided to think about why the reason I avoid women and getting into a relationship with them...I narrowed it down mostly to ""acceptance""...which brings me to my question.

‚Äã

I'm quite dominant with women and I like it but I dont know what it is about Men specially Dick that makes me want to be soooo submissive (Sorry for tmi again lol). My question is...are there Women out there that might find this attractive or sexy? I dont want someone to just ""accept"" this part...I want a Woman to be excited by this and for us to explore this together. I want someone to be excited about my ""submissive"" side and not just merely ""accept"" it as if it were a crime. Are there dominant women who get turned on by a switch Bi guy and the idea of exploration together in this world? :/",lgbt
Does your sexuality only depend on what you're sexually attracted to ?,"I've been gay for maybe the past 10 years. I knew I liked guys when I was in 2nd grade and I knew I didn't like girls when I was in 4th grade. However, I didn't know what gay was at the time so I thought that guys were supposed to be with girls even if they didn't like them. I grew out of the mindset towards the end of 7th grade when I finally came out. I never had a boyfriend nor have ever kissed a guy either. I had 2 girlfriends and kissed 3 girls. I have never felt sexually attracted to a girl  and only to guys. I have had close encounters with guys; something simple like a hug or holding hands for a few seconds where I would have this strange feeling that I never felt before (at least with my encounters with a girl). Last week, someone questioned me and asked if I'm even sure if I'm gay and how would I know if I don't have any experience (romantic or sexual) with a guy and I always thought that gay porn was a good enough justification to my sexuality but... is it really ?

Help? What am I?,"Hi! I‚Äôve never done anything like this before. I usually keep my thoughts to my myself but lately I feel like this one has been bothering me as it makes me uncomfortable in certain situations. And it makes me feel like I‚Äôm a stranger to myself so I think I need external help. I really want to describe this as perfectly as possible for anyone who‚Äôs reading this to understand. But just to sum it up I want to know if I am Lesbian or bisexual or straight because I just don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs driving me crazy. So to begin I am a female! And I am 18 years old. I‚Äôve never dated anyone. I think my whole life my mom has assumed I was lesbian because of the way I dressed (Tom boyish). She hasn‚Äôt directly said it to me but she hints it through conversations when she talks about gay people. So this has kind of annoyed me that she‚Äôs always thought I was lesbian just because of how I dress when to me, sexuality isn‚Äôt based on clothes. I know people say girls are supposed to wear girl clothes but I don‚Äôt care about that and I never have. I just see clothes I‚Äôm comfortable in and fit my individual taste and wear it and I guess it‚Äôs people that label things that ruin it. So because of the way I dress, people apart from my mom assume I‚Äôm gay. I‚Äôve been hit on by lesbian girls before but I genuinely wasn‚Äôt interested. Now I tell myself I‚Äôm not lesbian but I don‚Äôt feel straight either? Like when I think about it I‚Äôve never had a crush on a boy. When I was younger I acknowledged cute boys in my class but I would always have the urge to be best friends with them and not their girlfriends. As I got into my teens, I did what most teen girls did and gushed over cute male celebs. But the thing is although when I was younger I said I loved these guys I would never claim myself as their future wife or even envision myself dating them. I just loved them but would never want to picture myself with them. I also feel quite awkward picturing myself in a relationship and for that reason stray from them in college. No boy has ever had a crush on me and I think I would feel burdened by it if they did anyways. I can actually see myself not being in a relationship for the rest of my life. I feel like friendships and pets and family are all the things I need to get by on. Especially friendship that has always been important to me. I know if I tell someone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to date anyone‚Äù they would either say ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs lesbian‚Äù or think I‚Äôm totally crazy. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel like I don‚Äôt know who I am. I know I‚Äôm not lesbian because I don‚Äôt feel attracted to girls. I think they‚Äôre pretty but I can‚Äôt see myself dating one, crushing on one, or doing sexual activities with her. And this may be personal but if I watch porn it‚Äôs always straight porn. And I crave the male parts but would never want to be in a relationship with a guy. And I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being vulnerable enough to have friends with benefits either. I‚Äôve actually never masturbated. I know it‚Äôs probably too much information but I feel like a very odd human being and I have enough self awareness to realize that. I would also like to add that if someone every asks, ‚Äúdo you have a boyfriend... or girlfriend?‚Äù Usually I think ‚Äúoh yeah they assumed I was lesbian‚Äù but then I instantly think ‚Äúeven if someone assumed I was lesbian. That‚Äôs not a bad thing.‚Äù. So I just say no because I feel like I don‚Äôt have to explain my sexuality as well as be offended by it. I just don‚Äôt know what I am or who I like or what‚Äôs wrong with me. ",lgbt

How would you describe my sexuality?,"Sorry if this comes off as TMI. 

I'm a guy and for as long as I can remember I've always been physically attracted to guys. I can remember as early as when I was in kindergarten having slight crushes on guys and being shy around them. To this day I am still the same. I am super shy around guys and feel so nervous around them, especially good looking ones, but I am very comfortable around girls. 

In middle school and high school I've always thought of guys as hot and girls as gross. The idea of making out with a girl made me sick. 

These days it's a little different. 

I'm 25,  and for some strange reason now I get slightly attracted toward females. 

I can even watch straight porn/lesbian porn and get off on it but... I'm still not into the idea of making out with a girl. 

For the longest time, ever since I was a teenager, I've only ever gotten off on gay porn, but these days I not only get off on straight porn, but I also find myself fantasizing about having sex with a woman and giving her head. 

As far as relationships go? I don't think I can see myself with a woman. 

Nothing makes me happier than the idea of finding a guy that I'm attracted to both physically and mentally, and spending the rest of my life with him. 

I'm a little confused about my sexuality. Am I bisexual? Am I gay? ",lgbt

"Interested in the perspective of an LGBT person on something that happened to me, a straight dude, at a bar","My Halloween weekend out has been mostly fun but I can‚Äôt help thinking about an experience with someone at a bar and whether or not I am in the wrong. To set the scene, my good friend and his girlfriend invited me to go bar-hopping with them and we ended up at a gay bar. They went off to dance and I sat there taking shots of gin; all of a sudden this older man, around 55, began talking to me.
Now, I was at least eight drinks deep; drunk enough to disregard my environment while assuming the completely innocent interest of this gentleman. We had a conversation that spanned at least twenty minutes, at no point did he express any romantic interest in me. Some time later he invites me to take Jell-O shots with his friends in a truck. At this point I had figured out he was gay but not interested in me because, well, I am not very attractive and extremely awkward. Cut to his car, we‚Äôre taking Jell-O shots like nobody‚Äôs business. I ask him if I need to pay anything for the alcohol and he gives me an emphatic no. Then he starts asking me about my sexuality. I tell him outright that I am straight and most likely aromatic since I have never formed an emotional romantic connection with a woman along with an apologetic explanation that I wish I was gay because it‚Äôd be much easier to connect with the people who are usually interested in me (gay guys). Now this is where it gets muddied. The man started telling me I was very cute in a breathy way; I reaffirmed that I was unfortunately straight through no fault of me own. He then started feeding me vodka gummy bears by hand, a little strange but I didn‚Äôt feel threatened whatsoever. Somehow, my drunken friends found me out in the parking lot and dragged me away, I promised the guy I‚Äôd be back the next weekend but still felt awful because I think I lead him on somehow by agreeing to go back to his car. Was I in the wrong? I know it‚Äôs not uncommon for straight guys to goad gay dudes into buying them alcohol at these sorts of bars. My guilt is mostly stemmed from not paying him for the shots and also perpetuating that practice I mentioned. ",lgbt

We‚Äôre still very close friends, and he says that for years he through he was asexual because he just didn‚Äôt see what men saw in women. He felt no arousal. And he never allowed himself to think those thoughts about other men. When he did, all emotions came at once and so did his sexuality, if that makes sense.

advice?,"help, i am a 16 year old pansexual female who recently switched schools. this school is fairly christian and republican, and quite a few boys have a crush on me. however, recently i have catching feelings for a girl.
i'm super scared just because i'm new and all of the backlash i'm going to get from this. just the other day my friends and i were sitting outside during lunch and this one boy whispered ""ew why are we sitting near the gay kids?"" and i hear people talking crap about the lgbt community all the time and i don't know, i'm just scared.
furthermore, my mom is homophobic, so if i decided to try anything with this girl i'd have to keep it a secret from my mom.
also, since i'm fairly new at this school and have rejected every boy, if things end up not working out with this girl, people might assume i'm a lesbian and it could ruin all future chances of a relationship with a boy.

Bisexual Friend,"It's a kind of long story. I would like to point out that I'm straight, and that I grew up in the deep south (Mainly Texas [I come from an immigrant family]), so I grew up with mainly conservative/Republican views. I kind of differed, though, and am socially leftist and economically Republican (Feel free to ask about it. It confuses some people), and among my school I'm known for this. I never really grew up with any non-heterosexuals, so the LGBTQ community is a relatively new culture to me.

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl (who we'll call Alice) and we became real good friends. She has this other friend who is a transgender who is biologically female but identifies as male (we'll call him Jones). And, well Alice and Jones are best of friends and they do everything together, and I kind of joined the ""squad"" after seeing them out of class and we just kinda hung out. Since then, I've been seeing them more frequently and it's been great. I did develop feelings for Alice, and Jones thought I would be a good match, so hes rooting for me. Anyways, in one of our classes me and Jones were talking about Alice and what I should do and what she thinks about me, and I asked about her romantic history. Jones accidentally revealed to me that Alice has dated multiple women and is bisexual, and then said that he wasnt supposed to tell anyone, so he asked me to keep quiet (Which I agreed to, so that's why this is a throwaway account). 

Now, I'm cool with the fact that Alice is bisexual, I really like her and regardless, I dont really mind. But, I'm troubled. If Alice comes out to me, how am I supposed to react? What am I supposed to say? I really am trying not to screw this up, so any help is appreciated.",lgbt

How do I explain to my grandfather that some things just aren't funny?,"So, I'm gonna start off with the fact that I'm not transgender. I'm a big supporter of the community but I don't speak for trans people, they speak for themselves.

I have a fall festival at my school, and I'm hosting a booth for GSA. I'm on the board for the club, so it's just an obligation as the Activities Manager. I was talking to my grandfather about getting a ride and he said ""Since your part of this GSA thing why don't you tell them I'm your aunt."" I said that it wasn't funny, and he and my grandmother jumped down my throat about being the PC police. Apperently his joke was hilarious and I was being oversenstive. He said that he knew transgender people from when he was in high school. (Despite that, he still refers to my trans friends as their birth sex, despite me explicitly stating what to call them and their pronouns. But that's a whole other topic.) My defense was that it wasn't his joke to make because 1) he's not trans, and 2) it makes fun of the trans experience. (Plus, it honestly wasn't a funny joke to begin with, 'oversensitive' or not.)

so I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for a year now and a month ago or so she said she had this extremely important thing to tell me: she isn‚Äôt feeling comfortable with her body anymore... like if she was trapped.

This kinda shook me at first but after deeply thinking about it I understood that if this is what makes HIM happy, I won‚Äôt be the one who stops him from doing it.

We have been seeing each other on and off for several months. I consider myself a heterosexual male; all my past relationships have been with biological sex girls. 

I didn't know she was transgender until recently but, I am truly in love with her personality. 

She is the second girl I've met in my lifetime that I absolutely am head-over-heels in love with. 

Any advice for what not to do (or say) and things to do (or say?) 

She does not want to have sex until she dates; which is completely fine with me. 

I don't know how that would work necessarily; but I love her and I'll try. She has pretty high standards for guys; she constantly has a bunch of guys that try to get with her PURELY so they can ""see what it's like."" Pretty fucked, imo. She has accused me before of being ashamed of her but I happily hold her hand, kiss her in public. I truly love her. We have passionate make out sessions but she gets ""excited"" and needs to stop; and I happily oblige. I want her to feel comfortable when it comes to physical intimacy. Anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable?",lgbt
Is this typical platonic behavior for a male friend [19M] to be doing this to me [19M]?," After careful deliberation, I've decided to write this post so I can get to finally move forward and not think about it as much anymore. So for context, I've met a guy last July in one of my university classes, let's call him ""N"". We've known each other only for a short time, a year and a half, our friendship seemed to hit it off and he's what I consider to be a good friend of mine. One time however, we were waiting for our bus and I don't exactly recall how or why, we've joked about one of us being blind and it led to N asking me if he could hold my hand? I exactly can't recall if he was joking or not, it seemed rather insignificant at the time. I told him I didn't mind and we held hands for a solid couple of seconds. Neither one of us let go during that time though I did later because of his rather sweaty palms lol. It may seem that we were just joking, and that I thought so too... for a while. The next thing that made me pique my interest in him was on another time, I tagged him on a meme on Facebook detailing how ""the next time we will see each other in university, it won't be until March"" \[paraphrasing it\]. N commented that: ""...felt sad as he hadn't talked to a friend in weeks. Wanted to feel warm and cozy again."" I don't know but I get the feeling this isn't what men usually say to their guy friends, especially coming from a straight guy and me... well, gay. He knows this. He even one time, let me know he was gonna walk with me on our ways to class, still I didn't think anything of it then and remarked to him he was a mere gentleman to do so. The final thing nail in the coffin was during at the end of our semester, there was a small pet a farm animal event in our university, and as we were walking past it, I decided to pet the goats... after all, they are cute after all. Anyways, after I petted them, I saw N just standing, unmoving, gazing at me, as if he was admiring me from afar. I know how delusional it sounds, even when I tried to rationalize it in my head, it was a nagging feeling I sort of had. It felt like there was an expression in his face I couldn't read.

&amp;#x200B;

We're simply platonic, and I'm sure that's how he views me. He'd call me his ""homie/buddy"" once, heh... Aside from that, we'd used to take our basic classes together, usually sitting next to each other... nothing special, hang out every once or so often due to our busy schedules. I was once attracted to him, but nothing more than that. He isn't exactly the guy that I'd consider devastatingly handsome... but handsome nonetheless. This can't possibly be anything more than platonic right? It just seems surprising if it isn't. It has to be. What do you think? I am probably just overthinking it, it probably is the case of meeting a very affectionate, sweet, sexually secure guy who just happens to float on the other side of the river. In all honesty, I wish it was the truth... I'm not even ready for anything romantic at all!

&amp;#x200B;

So men and women, is this merely a rare, sweet form of platonic friendship he's comfortable showing or is this indicating something more?",lgbt

"Me and My Dad's language has never changed, even after I've come out.","This may sound a bit odd, and there is a small amount of back story before I get where I'm going. I am safe and happy, I just wanted to share some happy fluff with y'all. 

So, my dad has always communicated through giving me knives. Right on the cusp of puberty I decided I hated everyone and wanted to collect knives. My dad latched on to that, he's a good person but not the most emotionally intellegent. He does know a decent amount about knives though, so he decided thats how he would tell me he loved me.

At holidays or celebrations he would give me one. I got a knife for every holiday, a sword for graduation, and (because i find it theraputic) when a close family friend passed i got a beat up old knife to fix. Its been about 7 or 8 years of this now. he doesnt know i know, but he keeps a small stash of knives so he can give me one whenever Im having a hard time.

As an added side note, I am christian, i was raised christian.. im just not the same kind of christian as I used to be. I came out as bisexual almost 3 years ago and we've had a rough go about it since then. His stance has been basically, ""i dont like it and we wont talk about it but lord dont anyone criticize my daughter for it in front of me. Shes a good girl who makes her choices"" 

Well. Ive been having a rough time. Im not good at hiding it, and today my dad gave me a knife. He was smiling all goofy saying ""Well, i was looking and i picked this one because its a rainbow, because you know. Rainbow. They had others but this ones the only rainbow one OP."" Im ngl i was tempted to see how many times he'd say rainbow all pointed before he'd crack. I told him i liked it, especially the rainbow and he said ""well it's because i support you, you know, the rainbow."" Lord knows he's not eloquent enough to say the word bi, but honestly this means everything to me. Y'all ever seen a dog finally figure out how to get around a baby gate to come  tackle you? Yeah that was pretty much my dad's face when i told him i knew it was because I'm bisexual. Proud and happy...and then real proud again. Like he'd finally figured out a way to tell me he accepted me, without havin to deal with all the fancy word parts.

I guess I just wanted to share my happiness, and my new favorite knife. Change is slow, and lord knows its slow in the US south... but its changing. I hope yall find some reason to smile today, especially if youre struggling.

I don't want to be forced to come out to my parents. What should I do?,"Hi r/lgbt! 17 year old closeted gay cis male here, I have never posted but I lurk a lot. I am currently finishing up my applications to college and my parents want to read them. Great. That is so nice of them! There's a small issue though.

One of the schools I'm applying to has an optional question about sexual orientation. It is optional but my parents WILL see my response when they read it. I definitely don't want to put straight but I have only recently come out to some of my friends and even more recently my sister.

My (Short) Story of How I Found Who I Really Am,"Last night was my school's Halloween party. Due to fear of rejection, I hadn't been to any school events in about 6 years, disregarding homecoming freshman year of high school. I've known I was gay since the end of my 8th grade year, when I had a crush on a guy for the first time. However, due to fear of rejection from my conservative parents, I've acted straight for those 6 years. It's been painful. Well, last night was probably the best night of my life. From the moment I walked in the door my best friend from high school was there to welcome me (he has a boyfriend now :(). As the party got underway, I began to loosen up. To put it one way, I was as flamboyant as could be, but not on purpose. I was finally myself. I made some new friends, and I have a (gay)date with her on Monday. For reference, throughout public school, I was bullied badly because I was different. Last night was a completely different experience of love and acceptance.

Am I Transgender?,"I'm 14, FTM. I know alot of people would say that such a young person thinking about this sort of thing will eventually grow out of it but I've felt this way for 2-3 years now.

I've been extremely uncomfortable with my body ever since I've been growing up. To breasts to thick thighs, just the entire female anatomy disgusts me. Why do I have to get fat more easily than males in general? Just to state I'm Asexual and I have never been interested in females or males or relationships. The fact that me being born a female to take the female role and have children disgusts me so much, pregnancy, having breasts for the sake of children,when gaining weight all that fat goes towards your lower area and not stomach ect, I hate it so much, it's so uncomfortable. I'm extremely self conscious about my breasts, not the way they look in general or perky or saggy just the fact I have them. They're so useless and I can't go a day without worrying and trying to cover them up so I don't see them and others don't is so annoying. I get so jealous when I see guys have flat chests but I can't wear a shirt at all and have to wear jackets 24/7 because I hate that my chest even exists. I've never compared my breasts or my body/size type whatever you wanna call it, compared to other girls. I couldn't care less about that. 

I've researched alot about being transgender and what transgender is. When I hide my breasts with a good bra I feel so happy. I feel like I can do anything I want without having to constantly be conscious and cover up my shirt. I've always wanted a binder, but I have a regular bra (like a binder but shit and pretty cheap with average material let's say) and it's losing its affect of flattening my chest, looking like a regular bra.

I have always wondered ""why wasn't I born a boy?"" I have two step brothers. My parents always wanted a ""girl"" and they got one, me. I've always disliked girls when I grew up (not all of them of course) I never blended in with them, I had no similar interests to any of my female friends at all. 
I wear male clothing (shorts, oversized jackets, clothes from the male section, ect.) it's always made me so happy. Like I'm being my true self. But it's difficult for me to buy clothes and be happy with my body because of my weight and how big my chest, thighs and ass are. I cover these things of course but it really makes me depressed I have to do this and I can't do or buy things that would please me without discomfort with my body. (I know there's ways to fix this I'm just stating it.) this has led to me having extreme anxiety when going out comparing how shit my clothes look to girls. Not in the jealousy way if that makes sense. I think to myself if I was born a male I wouldn't have to worry about any of this and I could wear any type of clothing without being looked at as if I was incapable of dressing correctly to my assigned gender since nowadays everybody looks classy and shit. But everyone's different, it's just from what I've seen. 

I've come out to my inrl female friends a few years ago about me being transgender. They accepted me, but I really couldn't and still can't do anything at my young age to change anything or to transition. I know I'm young but I'm utterly sick of living like this with my body, hanging out with girls, I want to blend in with the boys. I want to do boy things, yada yada. I go as ""male"" online and ""he/him"" pronouns. It makes me feel more comfortable than to be called a she and her its so just repulsive to me and I can't handle it. (inrl doesn't make me feel any better.) Whenever somebody from inrl messages me online and asks what gender I am, it's so hard to answer because I really want to say I'm male but I can't at all because as you can see, I don't look nor speak as one. And coming out transgender for me, is a really personal topic since I have trouble trusting people.

At school it makes me puke (not actually) to wear such a tight female uniform (shirt) compared to the boy's loose shirts. Aswell with the skirts, I never grew up wearing skirts or dresses, I had the ""tomboy look."" it shows my breasts more than usual and I can't do anything about it. It's so shitty designed. 

When growing up, I've always had long hair.  I didn't necessarily enjoy it, I just didn't take much notice to it and never cut it. Since I'm growing older, I've decided to cut it at shoulder length as I think it suits me more and it's easier to handle. I've been self conscious about my face for a long time and whenever I had to tie my hair up, it made me crazy to do it everyday at school so I got it cut. It's easier for me to hide my face and it makes me happy. This doesn't really have to do with anything, thought I'd state it. (I don't regret cutting it at all) 
I don't wear makeup at all. I don't have any knowledge of it whatsoever. The only makeup I would wear is foundation but that's really just to apply under my dark circles under my eyes and pimples since they're pretty annoying. Anything other than that disgusts me or I have no interest in at all. 

I have come out to my parents. My mom accepts me but my dad finds it really weird which I respect. (they're both Christians so I grew up in a religious household so it's pretty sudden.) 

It's 12 at night and I'm pretty tired so I might have missed some important things, oh well. This is my first post on here but I really want advice, what can I do at the moment at my age, help, anything really, thanks. (this whole post is probably shit but I tried my best)",lgbt

Need advice and reassurance on how I handled my granddaughter confessing,"This is a bit long but please bear with me. As a parent and grandparent I have always discussed relationships with the children in a way that, in my mind at least, reassures them that the gender of their partner is never an issue. As they got older I made it clear that someone else's sexuality was a sacred thing and bullying etc wouldn't be tolerated. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago and my 10yr old grandchild came home from school and told me that she had confessed to her crush. I said ""Oooh and who is the lucky boy or girl?"" (My standard phrase when my grandkids speak about crushes etc) She got all shy and named a friend, Jenni, from a club she goes to. The friend can be a bit of a bully at times, there's been a few times she's made my granddaughter cry. My heart sank at the thought of this girls reaction.

I hugged my granddaughter and asked how Jenni  took the news and she said it went well, phew! It turns out my brave wee granddaughter has known she likes girls (her words not mine) for just over a year. We spoke about some reactions she might come up against and how to handle them. She gave me the biggest hug and told me she knew she could tell me anything and I would support her and still love her.

I'm ashamed to say it didn't go so well when she told her mum, my daughter, but a few minutes arguing with my daughter shut her up. I just hope she hasn't scared my granddaughter with her reaction. 

Did I do the right thing speaking to her about prejudice and people's reactions? I didn't want to scare her but I didn't want her blindly naive....now I'm worried I messed it up

I'm not entitled to that, it's their hardship and I have to respect their decisions. So should I have a one on one with him and ask him how he feels with me being able to call him he/him because if I do it might cause some sort of dysphoria? I don't want them to feel uncomfortable around me but I don't know how to approach it either, I know that they probably know I've seen the post, but I'm not sure  what to do.

Trans people and gender roles,"There's a post in r/TooAfraidToAsk asking if trans people reinforce gender roles. My comment is way too late to get noticed and most of the other comments are about what you would expect, so I wanted to post this here. I think it's an important understanding of the things trans people face every day.

I'm going to start by stating that trans people are incapable of  reinforcing gender stereotypes by nature. It is a stereotype that women are assigned female at birth and that men are assigned male at birth.  Assumptions about the way a man's or woman's genitals will look are  stereotypes. Etc. The core problem trans people have is people trying to  enforce these stereotypes on us. When you see a trans person in the  street, your ability to see them as trans is because they don't fit the  stereotypes you expect from the gender you suspect they're performing.

All of this is complicated by media. The public has a fascination  with trans people who are just beginning their transition and trans  people who fit the stereotypes extremely well. When you look at the  articles written about trans people, they are most likely to feature  trans people who fit either of those two categories. Articles, youtube  videos, and other media by trans people are more likely to become  popular if they fit those two categories as well. This is how cis people  use trans people to reinforce gender stereotypes.

When trans people first come out, there is often a period where they  play with gender roles. This often means playing roles that reinforce  stereotypes. This is a normal process that everyone experiences during  natal puberty. It's an important part of becoming your gender. It's  often an exaggerated process because of the driving need trans people  have to get free of dysphoria, but it's still basically the same  process. When viewed from the outside, this process often gives people  the feeling that trans people are trying to blatantly reinforce gender  stereotypes.

Trans people who have been out for a while are usually only featured  in media if they continue to fit cis people's understanding of the  gender binary. These are trans people who ""pass"" really well as cis men  or cis women.

When put together these two states, which originate from cis people,  create a narrative of transition that looks exactly like puberty, but  starts later in life and has a completion state. In the process it also  paints a picture of trans people as actively trying to reinforce gender  stereotypes. This understanding is so far from the truth that it isn't  even capable of being wrong.

The truth is that trans people are just people. There are some trans  people who adamantly enforce gender stereotypes, and push those roles  onto as many people as they can. There are some people who adamantly  fight against gender stereotypes and push to break down those roles at  every opportunity. I would say that most trans people are simply  muddling through life with the extra burden of having to constantly  think about these things because the nature of our beings irrevocably  breaks the gender stereotypes.

The definition of who is a man, who is a woman, and the roles they  should play are in constant flux. The borders are fuzzy and the language  used to define them is violence. The way that trans people's nature  breaks gender stereotypes is the source of the violence we face every  day.",lgbt

Did I go too far?,"I'm not exactly sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but here we go. (Also, I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting!) 

I frequent a small discord server of around 30 people. I've been there around a year so I feel like I know the group pretty well. For some reason the topic of transgender lesbians was brought up. Somebody said ""that's disgustingly messed up"" and nobody disagreed.

Now, I'm not LGBT but I fully support those that are. So I called the them out on that. After about 15 minutes of discussion, I called him a bigot. And now one of the mods has kicked me from the server for ""bullying"" him.

So I guess my question is, did I really go too far? I feel like they were just being assholes and I was in the right. Idk, I'd hate to lose a close group of friends like that, but at the same time, if they think like that I don't want to be in that group anymore.

Problems with family/coming out,"I‚Äôve been out to myself and almost everyone (expect for family) around me as a gay female for around a year now (before that I idetified as bi), since I started university so I moved out from home to the capital city of my country to study there, so I‚Äôm not around my family constantly anymore but I go home two times a month. Now I have a girlfriend and really supporting friends and I know that they all love me lots. I seem to be pretty confident and have never felt like i‚Äôm less than a person for being gay.
Now, I never had any problems with letting my friends and other people that I interact with know I‚Äôm gay but my family is another thing. I don‚Äôt know if my dad would mind the whole thing (honestly i dont think so) but my mom... she is terrible, every time we touch even just the topic of anything lgbt related she freaks out, calls lesbians ‚Äúfucking pussy lickers‚Äù, tells me every damn time that she really hopes I‚Äôm not gay and that if I were she wouldn‚Äôt want to meet me anymore at all, and that every gay person or really anyone from the community is a ‚Äúfreak‚Äù and just a disgrace for their parents, and how every parent would hate their kid being lgbt even if they act supportive. It really makes me feel like shit for obvious reasons. Even though I don‚Äôt live at home most of the time, I‚Äôm still depending on my parents financially and also emotionally (I‚Äôm an only child and I used to be relly close to my mom before I started constantly lying to them). 
The worst thing is that every time I visit my parents this happens, and every time I somehow feel like my mom is right, even though with my mind I know that she just talks shit, but I feel like really no one who isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdegenerate‚Äù like me could ever really like me, or even if they like me, they would just be happy that I don‚Äôt ruin their family, but mine. And like... I know it‚Äôs bullshit and I know that my friends love me and that there are really normal and great parents who still love their children and that I was just told this so many times that I somehow started to believe it.

Don't know if I'm an Ace or repressed Bi- please help,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but here it goes:

I'm pretty sure I'm asexual, but I don't know 100%? I've seen guys and girls that I find very- for lack of a better word - attractive. But not in a ""wow, I want to have sex with them way"", more in a "" wow, that person is so beautiful"" kinda way. And I've had crushes on people (guys and gals) where I fantasize about getting married and having a future together, but never about having sex with them.

But it's not like I don't have a sex drive, because I do. Not to get too detailed but I definitely have a sex drive. It just doesn't seem to be directed at anyone in particular?? 

The idea of sex is gross, but I'm not utterly repulsed, just a little freaked out. And I'm not sure if its because I'm a virgin or asexual.

I've been thinking that maybe I should try having sex (with both genders) before I decide if I'm an ace or just a really repressed bi (or pan??). 

Do you think that's a bad idea? Have any of you experienced anything similar? Please let me know.

"Need advice on ""coming out""?","This is probably a bit out of the norm but I'm still not really sure what to do.

I'm nonbinary (agender specifically but a little more masc presenting). I'm fully out as trans, and medically transitioning. I've identified as aromantic and asexual for most of my life.

Im secure in my gender identity. Im definitely not cis, and I've known since childhood. Im starting to realize though that I'm not aro or ace. I might still possibly be under that umbrella (demi specifically) but I definitely like guys and Im starting to come to terms with that.
Now, Im afab, so if I were cis, I would just be a straight girl. It wouldn't have been a surprise until I came out as trans (and maybe even after that) for me to like men. Problem is
I have a hard time discussing romantic and sexual things, especially with my family (don't have the best relationship). I'd like to I guess
basically come out
but I'm not entirely sure what orientation I'd be considered since I'm only into men, and I don't know how to approach the subject with them without having severe anxiety despite it probably not being much of a surprise at all. 

I feel like Im kind of taking away from the struggles of other LGBT people too because hey

if I were cis, I'd just be a straight girl, as expected,  so I feel like viewing this as ""coming out"" is invalidating other people, and that my feelings or concerns are kind of stupid and not really valid. I dunno how to shake this feeling and also find a comfortable way to address this all.

Any advice?

About to go on a date with a transwomen in a few days and honestly looking forward to it.,"So I'm gay, have been for years and never even thought of dating someone trans...that was until I met a girl named avery (name changed for privacy) who I honestly thought was a normal girl.

She started working with me, we got to know eachother over the past three months and for some reason I started getting feelings for her, which made me start thinking I was bi and made me question myself again. Yesterday I finally decided to ask her out and she looked at me with a surprised look on her face.

She looked at me and said, ""wow never thought you would be into someone like me who's trans! Been hoping you would ask me.""

She gave me a hug and we hugged and then that night we worked out when our first date will be, which is sunday. Right now I am really looking forward to it and now I think I might be pan but still a little confused. Just need to figure it out.

Anyway I've been wanting to share that story and thought this was the best place to do it.",lgbt

Asexual and Sociopathic Tendencies confused***,"Hello Guys :)

I've always been very confused about my sexuality and recently stumbled across the term os asexuality and realized that it had fit me perfectly in every way :)

(like a cozy blanket).

But I am very confused regarding the aspect of my romantic feelings.

I do not in any way experience sexual attraction and has never experienced sexual attraction towards anyone. But I have developed and liked individuals around me.

Disclaimer\*\*\* I have sociopathic tendencies diagnosed by therapists due to my childhood and how it had moulded me, no I wasn't born with sociopathic tendencies, and no I'm not sociopathic.

The problem is, my approach towards individuals romantically has always been the fact that I would not develop a romantic connection unless they had approached first, or if my friends wanted me to date them. As soon as someone responded in feelings, I would completely loose feelings towards the individual, but would date them because thats what people wanted me to do.

I always did what others wanted me to do, what I thought was normal for people to feel.

I have liked people before (romantically) but I have never ever been interested in someone without one of the reasons listed above happening.

I don't know, but I find that slightly odd, I don't know if thats normal or not

(just recently, I had thought that my sexuality was completely alike to those around me).

Am I overthinking this? Does she like me?," Hey there,

(Just a disclaimer: I did post this on [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually)actuallesbians as well. Figured I should post this another community where I could read difference responses/opinions.)

This is my first post, not too sure how to go about this but I'll give it my best try. It's that leap forward that gets you somewhere, and if I don't do this then I know I'll get nowhere with this at all. I'll probably end up hating myself for doing this, or regret will kick in and I'll feel like shit for the rest of the day. But if I'm being honest I've never spoken to anyone about my sexuality or anything really personal really. I do apologise beforehand if this is long and if I ramble on and on. I know it's annoying, it's something that I hate about myself too. Before anything else, I just want to thank you for even taking your time out of your day to read this. This is probably so stupid and quite possibly the lamest thing to be even using your time reading.

I'm in this somewhat dilemma and I don't know how to pursue this or if this is just simply nothing (maybe I'm just being friend zoned, or maybe she's just ""nice."") There's this girl at work, let's call her ""R"". She's about 4 years younger than me? Currently still in secondary school (she's legal, 18 is the legal age in Australia) and I think I've fallen for her. It's those subtle signs. This is probably one of the only times I'm crushing so hard, and my gaydar is terrible. To be honest, I'm pretty sure everyone at uni and work thinks I'm the straightest girl. Little do they know hey? (Maybe? I don't know.) It's obvious I'm a tomboy, even shows. But I think what confuses them most is probably my long hair? Possibly?

Anyway, I like R right? But I have no idea whether she likes me back. Do we flirt? Hell yeah we do. Do I catch her subtly checking me out from a distance? Of course and she catches me checking her out, vice versa. We've gone on lunch together, had a great time, talked about our personal lives and on both ends we ask quite personal questions too.

I have asked her once before if she has a boyfriend or if she's seeing someone. Her response was ""No, I'm not. No one wants to date me"". And the first thing that went through my head was like ""Hell yeah, she's single!"". But then the other half was like ""she's probably so straight. Like why wouldn't anyone date her?"". Doesn't really give me much of an answer if she straight or gay. It's one of those tough ones. I can't like straight up ask her how she identifies or who she's into. That's just creepy of me. I'm telling you right, she's gorgeous. She's beautiful and bloody intelligent and smart af as well. Straight A student and at the same time, she's a party girl? Because she goes out most Fridays and Saturdays. How isn't she taken, that's my question. She's beautiful.

My heart skips a beat every time I see her, even talking to her makes me flustered. The first few times talking to her, I would stumble on my words, get so flustered that I couldn't even talk straight. This is so embarrassing. I'm sorry, omg. And don't get me wrong, I'm sure she notices. It's so obvious right? Or maybe she's thinking ""this girl is so funny"". Probably.

I feel like we both make an effort to visit each other when we're in different departments, just passing by to see each other or on purposely trying to scare the other. No even joking but our eye contact, it's on point. It's like she's looking deep into my soul, I swear. She touches my arm or hand, when she's laughing or telling me something funny. Is that another sign? Physical contact? No? Fair enough, I mean I touch my friends on the arm when I'm telling something funny or laughing too. She faces her body towards me when speaking to me? Is that something? No? Because that's what most parents taught us to do when speaking to others when we were younger right? Fair enough, I think I'm just overthinking everything. This is probably nothing..

But in the beginning I noticed her licking her lips lots of times, flipping her hair, smiling lots and maybe she smiles all the time. I mean after like 3 years of braces, why wouldn't you show off your straight pearly whites right?

There was this one awkward moment when I was finishing early, she was working, went to hug her goodbye and both of us turned our heads the same way, nearly ended in us kissing but no. It was awkward, we laughed it off and I left.

Oh, you know how they say wearing red lipstick brings attention to your lips? She wore red lipstick this one day, and I noticed it. Did I say anything? Yes, because as you can tell I'm the most forthcoming and confident person of them all. No, I didn't say anything. But I noticed it. She was still just as beautiful, even with red lipstick on. Wow

Also, take in consideration, I think she's very straight because she's a big fan of 5SOS, One Direction, Shawn Mendez etc. Yeah, maybe I did stalk her social media before when it was public. I feel this connection with her, at the same time, i have this horrible feeling that she's straight. When I say shes a big fan, she was a bigger one before but I think now she's not so much of a HUGE fan like before. As she's older now, focusing on the more important things in life.

One other thing before I end this, she's like best friends with a couple of girls that we work together with. They grew up together, went to the same school and whatnot, started working together at the same time. Is it weird that when I tell her friend (whom I'm friends with as well, not really best friend with) that we went on our break together, and then she's like ""yeah I know, R told me"". Is that weird? Then again, it's just a girl thing yeah? Or like ""I've heard this story before.."" and I'm like ""from who? I only told..oh.."". And then i think she realises, so i stop and it's awkward. So I'm guessing she heard that from R telling her? That's cool, no harm done. I've met a couple of her friends. Well not met met; but seen her friends with her. And her friends have caught me staring at her as well, which is embarrassing. Another time she went to try on a shirt, and the same friend convinced her to ask me how she looked in it. Even though she was very embarrassed? Not sure if embarrassed is the word, but she was clearly not wanting to ask me. I think she was embarrassed to ask me, I mean judgement from someone you like is critical right? And it would mean a lot to them. But I could hear them beforehand, (in the fitting room) going back and fourth about how her friend wanted her to ask me how she looked in the shirt. But she was too embarrassed to ask me, maybe she was just shy. But well with some convincing, (Well myself and the girl I was training could hear their bickering, so we were like ""what's going on..?"" And they heard us, so that's when she came out and asked. She was bright red though, I think she was a little hesistent to ask me) she asked and I said she looked good in it. Which is the truth.

I'm sorry this is so long and boring. I'm just stuck in this rut, and I don't know if I should do anything about this or if I should just drop it. This is probably nothing, just another straight girl crush. Please do share your opinion, I'm all for it. But thank you for reading this if you've gotten this far, I really do appreciate it.

Thank you,

Advice for a up and coming young person.,"I've known I was gay since 8, I've recently turned 19 and my family treats me like a child talks to me like a child, I run a small business my cash goes to help the family, hard times are a real jerk I've gone though a lot thought about who i am and dealt with inner demons I am a very quite shy person but I over come that and have been doing better I want to become a crystal healer and interact with people more, My family supports me but does not have the time to help me I can help my self that's not the point the point is they think someone needs to take care of me my only thing is they don't think I will ever meet someone they think guys would make fun of me but I will say this I've had 14 guy friends on the internet and yes they were straight they knew I was gay but the thing that happened surprised  me  they were attracted to me and I don't look for love online because I don't want to tell them that we can never meet because I still live at home and my family hates! Meeting people off line, if I met the right human being I could have a lot more in my life I could have a person my family would trust and would let me have a lot more freedom, but finding a boyfriend is hard enough as it is for some but finding one in the shape that my life is in right now is a little bit harder, the people who live near here stay to them self's and most I would highly not date but for one he MIGHT be gay he is kinda cute i know hes about 20 and he does not do drugs and I know hes mom and brothers name and were he lives I walk dogs for a living so I end up meeting everyone and knowing everyone so any advice and for a side note I have a speech issue and I look 14 but I am really 19 I know its weird I've honestly said its because I am magical and I eat skittles I've had a rough week thinking about this type of stuff any words of wisdom.",lgbt

My girlie &amp; I heading out for the day,,lgbt
I am super super confused.,"Okay so long story short, I've considered myself a lesbian for a long time. I've only ever dated girls, I've only ever been with girls. I have a strange aversion to men as a whole, it's just weird, they always make me uncomfortable. I recognized recently that a lot of this stems from issues with my father, but that's besides the point. It's been a very long time since I was romantically or sexually attracted to a man,and after I realized I was a lesbian I figured that any of those feeling were down to internalized homophobia and wanting to fit into society. Since I accepted that part of myself I've been much happier and have been solely attracted to women. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now here's the part I'm sure you knew was coming, there's this guy. He's just genuinely sweet and nice and smart. And we do the same thing, and the conversation between us just flows so normally. We became friends really quickly, and I've always been sure that he doesn't think of us as just friends. However I've never encouraged this - I'm not a jerk. But lately I've been feeling more then just friendship. I've thought about this a lot, and I think honestly like him as more then a friend. And I don't know what to think, like the idea of explaining this to my friends and my family makes me sick to my stomach. And I'm so worried that like I'm falling right into all the stereotypes that anti-LGBTQ people say like ""You just haven't found the right guy"". I don't want to be that person, but like the idea of not acknowledging this guy like hurts my heart? I don't want to just let this go in order to stick to my ""gold-star-lesbian"" ideals. I'm just so confused? Is this normal? Am I bisexual? Am I just confused? Am I just lonely? Has anymore else gone through this? ",lgbt

Am I Trans?,"Yeah, and I know that question is asked a billion times daily on this sub. But it‚Äôs been a real pain in the ass, trying to figure it out, and the only answers I‚Äôve been getting is ‚Äúyou‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù or ‚Äúbe patient‚Äù. So here goes, and forgive my really long rambling.  
My birth name is Nathan, but a lot of the time I go by Amber with my friends. I‚Äôm a junior in high school, and I‚Äôve started having some vague thoughts, some remotely sexual I guess (not sure about that part) about being female since at the very least seventh grade and possibly longer as well, back to maybe 5th grade when my friend explained to me the idea.   
The issue, however, is that I‚Äôve always had dislike for my body, originally my weight and then acne and other things. At my current point I‚Äôm actually not too bad in the body positivity department, not happy or whatever but I‚Äôve accepted I‚Äôm around if not a little below the average area and not totally ugly. I‚Äôve had a girlfriend and somewhat intimate experiences but definitely not looking towards sex. However my point overall is like, dysphoria wise, I don‚Äôt really get it much? I mean, sometimes when I‚Äôm browsing through this or some other LGBT sub and I‚Äôll see some flawless trans girl I‚Äôll get really upset for reasons I can‚Äôt fully trace, but overall? Being in my body is manageable. Down there, with the ‚Äòequipment‚Äô so to speak, honestly seeing that sometimes makes me uncomfortable or cringe when I, but at the same time, the thought of bottom surgery does too. Metaphorically speaking my body isn‚Äôt the best, per se, but I guess it‚Äôs comparable emotionally and mentally to driving some new, sleek Mustang being transitioned as opposed to some dirty old crap car you‚Äôve had your whole life and have adjusted to. And I‚Äôm far from an emotional person, at least publicly, and regarding pronouns, honestly I somewhat prefer female (I think?) but it doesn‚Äôt matter much. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not gender-neutral or enby either, because my feelings are pretty consistent except for when I suddenly get into fearful bouts of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not/can‚Äôt be trans‚Äù.  
Emotionally and personally are, arguably, like, bigger issues. I don‚Äôt have feminine speech patterns or interests a lot of the time, being all cutesy and stuff is something I sorta feel into a little bit every now and then but I feel like I‚Äôd be lying if I said I had a female personality, despite wanting one? I make stupid and dirty jokes incessantly, I‚Äôm obnoxious, loud sometimes around my friends I‚Äôm comfortable with, but a bit shyer in public. I have typically male interests; video games, superhero stuff, guns, all that (although I do like a well-written romance book every now and then, and I‚Äôm far from a competitive or sporty person). And I‚Äôm not sure how much this affects things but I never spent much time on my appearance, and me and a few trusted friends were gonna work on makeup and seeing if I could pass, but I‚Äôm even a bit anxious about THAT. Weird thing to say but for me I almost feel like...I don‚Äôt know, if I‚Äôm really obviously just biologically male wearing female clothes, what‚Äôs the point? Maybe I‚Äôll feel a bit better but it won‚Äôt do shit unless I pass. Sometimes I sort of think and wonder that if I was female, I could have a more feminine personality and do more feminine things without feeling awkward and still be happy with myself, but I‚Äôm not sure. I have ADHD and possibly some bigger self-esteem issues or depression, if that affects things?  
Regarding my social life and this situation, it‚Äôs been mixed. Before I realized I was trans and probably something that helped me realize it was that online in games and chat rooms I would go on with a female username or persona (not sure if that‚Äôs immoral but oh well). AFTER I realized, I confronted one of my trans friends about it, and she said that out of our group of friends I was the most likely she thought would be as well due to being asexual and general behavior and not really caring about style or my body for some reason, although that could‚Äôve been hindsight bias. Every single other person I ever told was completely blindsided by it. My parents, after raiding my social media account and reading all my conversations and secrets (still haven‚Äôt mentally recovered lmao) had varied reactions. My more liberal mother confronted me first and before she figured out the truth assumed I was gay (she believed that for a while for some reason and still thinks I like men), but once I told her the truth she was supportive, saying I could make my own decisions, she understands, offering to help with transition, etc. However, once she did her own ‚Äòresearch‚Äô, her opinion continuously changed. Her mindset then moved to that I can make any ‚Äúnon-permanent‚Äù decisions, then moving to her classic position of hardcore pressuring me NOT to, and not even allowing me that. She currently believes and has said things like that there was no sign in childhood (which is probably true from her experience but I‚Äôm vaguely sure that I remembered dressing up and playing pretend with a lot of female friends I had, although not positive), that there was NEVER a time that I said anything or did anything that made her think ‚Äúwow, that was effeminate‚Äù, and that there‚Äôs really no point of transitioning because I‚Äôm so manly and I‚Äôd just be a ‚Äúmanly girl‚Äù. Another thing to note would be whenever I really see anti-trans rhetoric regarding me or not, saying that a lot regret surgery or that I‚Äôm not trans, I instantly go paranoid about it, such as ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm not trans and I said I was to my friends and now I‚Äôm just playing along and have to eventually admit that I‚Äôm a boy‚Äù and the like. My mom‚Äôs comments had the same effect, even though she‚Äôs claiming she doesn‚Äôt want me to be pushed into either role of male or female but suspects my friends have done so with me thinking I‚Äôm trans. My conservative father, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt understand nor really care about me being trans, and ironically is more supportive than my mother has been. He doesn‚Äôt believe I am and all that, but he firmly believes that it‚Äôs my life and therefore ‚Äòmy funeral‚Äô.

So the biggest point is that just...it‚Äôs less of reasoning that I‚Äôm not trans, but I honestly feel like the only thing that could even classify me as trans is the mentality that I want to be a woman at least in physicality and sometimes emotionally? Now I know that sounds dumb and how ‚Äúthat‚Äôs every trans person‚Äù, but what I mean is like from an exterior or behavioral perspective there are no signs. There isn‚Äôt any objective reason or thing that I‚Äôve said or done or shown before my knowledge that I‚Äôm *really* trans, and not just curious or some weird-ass sexual deviant. So am I trans? And if so, how? I‚Äôd really, really like some hard truthful answers, trying to be as objective as possible regarding it instead of relying on ‚Äúwell do you think you‚Äôre a woman‚Äù or something. And as a reminder, I‚Äôd rather get the truth than a yes, if you get my meaning.

Anyway, that‚Äôs all I can think of for now. Sorry for wasting your time, and thanks for reading. You can message me or put down a comment if you have an answer or are willing to help.

A few days ago I got my hair cut shorter than I ever have, and I felt so happy. Looking in the mirror I actually loved what I saw. I didn't understand why it made me so happy, but I think it might be bc I looked like I could possibly be a guy.

I've always felt uncomfortable in my body, but I figured it was due to being fat and having body image issues. But lately I've just been so frustrated by my breasts, wanting them gone. And honestly I've hated the size of them for as long as I can remember.

Despite being a lesbian, I have this fascination with men's faces and bodies. Not in a sexual way, but still some sort of desire. I usually enjoy straight porn more than lesbian porn.

As a kid I had mostly guy friends, though I liked girls a lot, they made me very nervous and I felt out of place with them.

I used to imagine romantic stories as a kid between a guy and a girl, but I identified with the male characters much more than the girls. I'd always watch romantic movies/shows and relate to the guy a lot.

One hell of a situation,"Hello,

I don't know if this is in the wrong spot or anything so please forgive me if so. Also, if the formatting is off I'm doing this from my phone.

I have been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and just a few days ago I underwent the realization that I was gay. For my entire life I had been repressing feelings that were there and telling myself they weren't right. And now I've dug myself such a hole by doing that, that I genuinely don't know what to do.

My girlfriend is truly an amazing person, coming out of an abusive household with a life that to be fair, before college, was pretty shitty. She had been thrown so many curve balls by the universe that it's genuinely unfair. 

My problem is, is that I can't continue in this relationship. I want to be friends, and I really don't want to hurt her. I don't know how or when to tell her. I really don't want her to hate me or think that I'm lying, or even blame it on herself. Dealing with depression and anxiety I know that the first thought that will run through her head is that it's her fault. I just don't know how to do it as painlessly as possible as bad as that sounds. I want to come out of this as friends and certainly don't want to lose her but I'm scared that she won't want to be around me at all after this. 

I don't plan on coming out to anyone but maybe a few people, but I don't know what I would say to our friends either, I don't really want them to know for a while and if I just tell everyone that I suddenly broke up with the woman I thought I was going to marry, it'd certainly raise some eyebrows.

Any help whatsoever would be entirely appreciated, please.",lgbt
A thought I had on the hypocrisy of many of those against the LGBT community.,"I hope this is okay for me to post this here, it was just a thought that I put into words. This of course is not directed at the members of this group, but towards those who are against members of the LGTB community. This is something I wish I could say to all of them because to me it just really does not make sense.

This is for everyone who is so against members of the LGTB community.....you do realize how hypocritical you all are right?

You are all okay with the concept that workplaces and employers cannot discriminate against things like gender, gender orientation, sexuality and sexual orientation, religion, race etc....but you yourselves have no problem publicly judging people about these things...pathetic.

Especially when you take into consideration how many of you would full on disown your own children if they should be involved in anything you are not in agreement with...such as being gay or transexual.

Just something for you all to think about...if its not okay for your employer to judge you based on these things...why is it okay for your family and friends to?",lgbt

Hello r/LGBT! I need your help. I‚Äôm hosting a Pride Night at my local arcade and I could use some input.,"This is my first long winded text post. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs not formatted very well.

# Some Background

I live in South Texas, specifically the Rio Grande Valley (the literal bottom of Texas,) and after some research I found there are very few queer public spaces here. There are some events, advocacy groups and a few bars, but I was pretty disappointed that there weren‚Äôt any more spaces that felt both approachable and coincided with my interests. After crying a bit, I figured I should just try and just make a queer space myself (with the help of my friends.) Here are some details about the situation:

* It‚Äôs a fairly small arcade, total capacity at a single time is maybe 100 people. It's usually open from 4PM-12PM (but we can mess around with the events time frames with no issues.)
* There are a lot of classic and new cabinets you can‚Äôt really find anywhere else, and the owner I‚Äôm working with can interchange them out quite easily to sub in any games the community wants. They also have a ton of consoles (from old school to plenty of new school ones PS4,XBOX‚Äôs, Switches.)
* The arcade is free play, and entry is usually 5 bucks. The owner doesn‚Äôt really run the arcade for major profit. It‚Äôs a passion project for everyone involved, and it‚Äôs very obvious when you set foot in there that it‚Äôs made by gamers for gamers. Most of the money the arcade makes is from events (tournaments, birthday parties and stuff like that.)
* It isn‚Äôt a bar-cade, so they don‚Äôt serve alcoholic drinks or food (but there are bars &amp; really good food places nearby.) I spoke with a few of my friends about what they‚Äôd want to see and on most of their lists, alcohol was usually somewhere on there. So far after talking with the owner quite a bit, his policy seems very ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask, Don‚Äôt tell.‚Äù As long as you‚Äôre not causing problems for the other patrons and you‚Äôre not bringing any drinks inside, you can come in buzzed or stoned to play a bit. You don‚Äôt really every see any drunk people, but you do see a few stoners every now and again.
* We‚Äôre planning on doing giveaways, contests, and other shenanigans. Of which, the details are a bit blurry (that's where you come in!)

My personal intentions for the event are to make it as approachable as possible while pushing for a good turnout. I‚Äôm going to avoid framing it like *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre opening our doors to all of the LGBTQIA+ community on every third Tuesday of the month‚Äù* (which kind of implies that they don't already?) Instead, I want it to be more of an active celebration of queer &amp; gaming culture all rolled into one fun night every month. I want people to look forward to surrounding themselves in their community with their friends, without the usual awkward pressure to fit in. (Which will always exist, but at least they don't have to put themselves in places that they wouldn't normally go, like bars, which I know aren't for everyone.)

I don‚Äôt want it to have any weird sexual undertones (or overtones since gay and arcade in the same sentence seem to pull interesting search results.) I also don‚Äôt want it to be geared towards a specific subset of the LGBTQIA+ community, which I imagine could be easy if I were to rush it ^(since I am a flawed gay cis man.)

So I guess I have a few major questions, and separately I‚Äôm open to general feedback.

1. What are some of the intersections between queer culture and gaming culture that I can try to incorporate? Aside from Bowsette and Menat ^(yaass), I haven‚Äôt really gotten any ideas. This could apply to the prizes for giveaways, the music playing, and even the games we put on display.
2. What are some of things you‚Äôd personally like to see from an event like this, if one was running in your near area?
3. Are there any specific games that would be cool to bring out?
4. What night of the week would you feel most comfortable going out to an event like this? (I made a strawpoll for this question, [vote here!](http://www.strawpoll.me/16709060))

On Love (as I understand it),"   Figuring out that I was gay was a confusing and sometimes scary process, but I can honestly say that I am better for it. While most of the crushes I've had since then have mostly been sexual in nature, the most recent and currently ongoing one is much more messy. 
   Here's the deal. I moved in the first month of my senior year (2017-2018), and met a whole bunch of people at my new church, with one standing out in particular. While attractive, his personality is what really draws me in. He is kind to everybody; in the year I've known him, I've only seen him get angry once--and that was only for a few seconds before feeling ashamed of it afterwards. He gives freely and smiles often. He is not afraid to put himself out there, singing and dancing with complete gusto. He is funny and even na√Øve. In short, he is perfect, especially considering my sarcastic, bitter attitude toward others and my hesitation to get outside of my limited comfort zone. 
   I love him, not a shallow lust, but a deep lasting bond that straddles the gap between the platonic and the romantic. After realizing this, I made the decision to come out to him last December, in order to have somebody to confide in within my church group and to give him the chance to realize how much I cared for him. (I didn't explicitly explain that I had a crush on him.) 
   Since then, we've had several long conversations about feelings, ranging from his dates with girls to my thoughts about the mere prospects of me dating. After every time we see each other (roughly biweekly), we share a lasting hug. I love these because they are full of warmth and free of the stigmas of heteronormative society. He won't hesitate to say ""I love you, man."" But I will, not because he might misunderstand, but because I might.
   While I know that I love him, in which way is still a foggy question. The very sight of him is bittersweet, because I couldn't ask for a better friend, but I also fear that I'll never find a romantic partner that is as truly, humanly good as he is. The thought that I'll never find a match like him is a deeply scary one.",lgbt

Walked in on bro and friend kissing update,"Last post:https://old.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/9q2cdl/walked_in_on_my_younger_bro_and_his_friend_kissing/ 

Update- so everything is fine now yay!, Pikachu came over to our house and I apologised for walking in on them and he said it was okay, he also apologised for ignoring bro and found it funny ignoring me(wow).  I also did warn them to be more careful doing stuff like that especially in our house while our mom and dad are home. bro and him spoke privately for a little while (which I didn't think about it then but they were probably actually making out lol......) and everything is okay again.
I'm still worried for bro though if mom and dad find out since I don't know how exactly they'd react to him being gay... I would never let them do anything bad to him, I just don't want him to feel like it's not right being gay or something...
Anyway I'm really happy that they're still friends (or boyfriends lol) and thanks for everyone that helped in the last post!

I don‚Äôt mess with people or really piss them off, I‚Äôm just one of the weirder kids with my little friend group. Regardless of the possibility of backlash from others, I‚Äôm really excited to meet other gays in a safe environment and getting the group rolling. The first meeting is this Thursday morning, and I hope it goes well! I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall updated",lgbt

"What am I? Not so sure I'm ""straight"".","It's something I never put much thought into over the years. If I was asked if I was straight, gay, or bi, I'd always say straight. After all, I've only ever dated women. It was an easier answer. But observing my behaviors and thought patterns, I'm not so sure what I am. I love the female way too much to be gay, but am I perhaps bi?

I have been consistently mistaken as ""gay"" for most of my life because I'm well dressed, well groomed, am a hair stylist, and I'm perfectly aware I give off this very metro or ""gay"" vibe. It's just how I am. Back in high school I was picked on for being a ""f**got"" more than the actual gay kids were.

in recent years I've had roughly 100 sexual partners (struggled with sexual addiction due to severe depression), all being women minus one man, and even then it was foreplay at best. He was hot, well dressed, rich, popular, and pursued me endlessly. But when we fooled around, I just didn't feel much. I guess how you can put it is the male body is very attractive to me, minus the sexual parts. When I'm at the gym I find myself checking out the buff gym guys a lot more than I do the girls in their yoga pants on the ellipticals. I'm not into the skinny twink types or the hair ""bear"" types specifically, but when I see a hot guy, I know it. At least what I consider to be hot.

I know this is all super shallow, but I'm just being honest. When it comes to things like anime I watch, I almost always really like a well written yaoi (such as Junjo Romatica or Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi), can't stand yuri, but I also like your normal hetero romances. So I guess the only ones I really like are the male-male or male-female ones?

When it comes back to being sexually involved, even though it's been a while, I love anal play... but by myself. The idea of being penetrated by a man seems off to me, but at the same time if the right guy came along I wouldn't be opposed to it. And the thought of a female doing it to me is a total turn-off. With women I'm always the dominant one and like it that way, but with the right man, maybe not? I know I sure as hell tend to be flattered and blush internally when a cute guy flirts me up.

Perhaps my ideal man could only exist in fiction? Because the gay or bi guys I meet tend not to be my ""type"" and I can't find myself being romantically attracted to them.

**So all of this being said,** I can't exactly pin-point what I am. Straight or bi? Is there an in-between? Admittedly I'm at a loss and would much appreciate some feedback. ",lgbt

An Apology,"(This was x-posted from r/bisexual) I'm not sure if this type of post is allowed so if it isn't, the mods can go ahead and take it down.

I'm more of a lurker when it comes to reddit. When I started using reddit, however, I was a very vocal person. I made posts about everything, and commented as much as I could. I found one of my old accounts somehow and remembered the post I made on r/bisexual about a year ago. I'm not gonna go into detail but I expressed my dislike for  transgender people in the post. One of you called me out on it but I stood my ground, continuing to believe that being transgender was a  choice, and that people were doing it for attention, or because it was  ""trendy.""

Months later, I met someone on the internet. We became close friends, and about three months ago, he came out to me as transgender. At first I  didn't say anything, because I didn't want my opinions to effect him. He began to express his troubles to me, describing his dysphoria and how he identifies. And that was when I decided to educate myself more on  the topic. I began to watch videos, read articles, and talked to people  who were transgender. I learned that it wasn't a choice, I learned that  they're not going to harm anyone, that they weren't doing it for  attention, and most importantly, I learned how happy someone can become,  when they finally realize their true identity. The apache attack helicopters and ""Did you just assume my gender?"" jokes weren't funny  anymore, and I began to distant myself from my toxic friends.

One week ago, I was sent a really long message from my friend. A  majority of it was too personal for me to say, but he explained things  about how he feels, and what other people think of him.

That same night, he took his own life. He was only 17 years old, and his name was Dorian.

So, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I'm sorry to anyone I've hurt. I expressed my opinion on a topic that I had no knowledge of.

I hope you all are safe, especially in America right now.

I know these numbers are posted everywhere, but I still think you all  should be aware of the hotlines (Nation Suicide Prevention Lifeline -  1-800-273-8255, and The Trevor Project - 1-866-488-7386, and [here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) of the suicide prevention numbers if you don't live in America). Please talk to someone if you are struggling.

Stay safe,

Looking to learn about asexuality.,"So I‚Äôve been doing my best to learn more about the community at large because of my distancing from it in the past due to biphobia. If anything I ask is offensive, please tell me. I‚Äôm willing to hear everyone‚Äôs side, because I‚Äôm not coming from a place of personal experience or full knowledge. A full disclaimer, I have been working through some issues stemming from an ex-SO who identified as asexual, so I am doing my best to process through that, so if I ever come across in a bad way, please tell me. I probably need a check.

1) I‚Äôve understood asexuality in the past to be a lack of sexual attraction, so that‚Äôs the basis I‚Äôm working with. More recently, though, I‚Äôve seen many people saying that it‚Äôs okay to enjoy sex if you‚Äôre asexual. I never was under the impression that asexual people never had sex ‚Äî for a terrible example, I have no desire to eat oranges, but it‚Äôs not that I will never eat an orange, I just don‚Äôt have the drive to ‚Äî but the ‚Äúenjoying sex‚Äù statement confuses me. The only way I‚Äôve been able to work through this is that there‚Äôs only a lack of sexual attraction toward people, but the act of sex itself is still pleasurable (for some, sex-repulsion is a valid thought processes). Is this in the right track?

2) Aphobia is real. That‚Äôs not a question. However, some people bat around that asexuals are not included in the LGBT+ community because they can be cishet (emphasis on can, not always are). I am torn on this issue because on the one hand, it seems understandable that cishet aces would not fall under the LGBT+ label. However, I‚Äôve often also thought that it‚Äôs basically everyone who isn‚Äôt what society considers to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (cis, het, with sexual attraction) belongs under the label, and that it‚Äôs best to let people decide on their own. What‚Äôs your take?

3) Lastly, this is possibly a hurtful question, so please be warned. My ex identified as asexual, but only told me halfway into the relationship. Because I did not know, I was put into a state of severe self esteem loss because all of my physical advances would be rejected. I would never press any farther than asking, but it has seriously messed up how I see myself, even now that I know they were ace. Here is the problem ‚Äî if I had known they were asexual, I would not have entered a relationship with them, rather I would just want to be friends. This loops back to the first question ‚Äî assuming a person is not sex repulsed, but asexual, I would (in my current understanding) feel uncomfortable being in a relationship with them. Just as an asexual person is valid for not having sexual attraction, I am valid for having it. However, I‚Äôve been called aphobic in the past for this. Is this view aphobic?

Thank you for your time.",lgbt

too gay for my family to watch me on Youtube? :{,"[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn6K21OKfxpHi8YQmWOO7ag?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn6K21OKfxpHi8YQmWOO7ag?view_as=subscriber)

&amp;#x200B;

Guys I feel very depressed. I like to make people laugh and entertain them with just being silly. Recently I decided to start a youtube channel so I can feel happier and get some fulfillment out of my life by letting some people find  escape from the real world and get a couple good laughs after watching me or relate to me and the things I have gone through and see it will get better. Long story short the main people I thought would support me have 100% let me down. I have even been told that I am ""too gay"" for them to even watch my videos. Yet I am 100% authentic and I act on camera how I am in real life. If I feel like being sassy one moment I am, If I feel like being serious another I am. But for friends/family members to say, they can't watch my video because I am gay. It really hurts. I have not felt the way I am feeling right now since I was in middle school and was bullied for being gay. I also caught some friends talking about how ugly I look on video. I literally have not cried because of feeling depressed since middle school and I can't stop. Should I delete my channel? I don't know what to do? Are they right? Please I am looking for some honest critique and advice. Am I too gay and ugly for people to watch me?",lgbt

"Finding Love, Support, Relationships","Hey everyone, I have to warn everybody that you are about to read a long post and would like serious responses and any helpful advice. 

To give you a good idea of my background, I am a 26 year old average looking guy living in a smallish city and I am having many issues with finding love, support, and keeping friends that I can‚Äôt shake this crushing empty feeling I have. 

I‚Äôve been single for the last year after ending a 3 year relationship and had my fair share of hookups, a couple of dates, and met two guys who were serious about a relationship but didn‚Äôt last longer than two weeks. 

I seem to never have the time to ever have a life of my own but I‚Äôve been feeling like even if I had all the time I needed I still wouldn‚Äôt do anything with it. 

I work 2 jobs Sunday through Monday, which is how my weeks is set up and off two days Tuesdays and Wednesday‚Äôs. I usually will work 9am-2:30 then have a two hour gap until my second job which is 4:30p-11:30pm. 

By the time I get home I am exhausted and it‚Äôs generally too late to gather up enough interest for people to care to meet up. The main reason for having two jobs is to afford my living expenses. 

And on my days off I can usually get someone interested in meeting up whether it‚Äôs lunch with my close friend or try to have a fling. But lately, I feel like my life is in such a limbo and has died down so much. 

I do have Grindr and I have used tinder before, plenty of fish, and even eharmony for a short period and I am at the point in my life where I want to meet someone serious and looking for a relationship. 

The experience I‚Äôve had with the other guys in my area used to shock me with what other people are capable but now I can see from a mile away the patterns of gay men and I feel not very confident about finding what I‚Äôm looking for. 

Im looking for a kind, pure, goofy guy that wants to build towards a future and eventually get married and have a family. I know that seems heteronormative and I could go on a completely different rant about how I feel that there has been a shift in expectations and realities of current ideals about love, sex, and relationships in a new generation shaped by modern technology compared to ten years ago. 

Of course there are changes to be expected as we evolve but aside from that, love seems to be more vague and frustrating just in my experience. 

I find myself reading the minds of typical guys I wish would give me the time of day. Sure, some have expressed interest but then as time goes on, their interest fades away and it seems no one is interested in making an effort or wants to put the labels on a relationship, which is completely fine. 

I for one, do not like to be confined by labels. I don‚Äôt want to call two people ‚Äútalking‚Äù or ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù dating but that‚Äôs just what we have redefined as 2018 dating. But it‚Äôs hard to deal with rejection in 2018 terms and I know I have had a lot of it. 

Whenever I get the excuse from other guys ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just super busy right now‚Äù I can pretty much deduce that you‚Äôre no longer interested in me, are seeing someone you‚Äôre more interested in, or just are an asshole and don‚Äôt want to face up to saying the truth. 

I know I‚Äôm not completely there where I need to be yet where I can just focus on being me. I don‚Äôt know if I ever will be at that place where everything will be easy because I am very much a guy that does a little too much overthinking for his own good, reads into everything, and has developed abandonment issues from the wrong kind of guys.

 Im looking for validation in the wrong places. And I can‚Äôt help it because everyone wants to feel loved, and desirable, and yeah sometimes with men, things feel a little more personal sometimes when I know I‚Äôm a great person but knowing gay men typically look for physical attraction before anything else. And I feel like I barely come close compared to the guy I wish I could be. 

And sometimes I don‚Äôt believe personality has anything to do with it because I‚Äôve heard the spill about it‚Äôs not just about looks. I‚Äôm not sure what to call it. 

My biggest weakness will always be that I will forever be in my own head to just drop everything and just have fun with things and not read into anything. It‚Äôs never been a bigger challenge. 

But at the same time I feel like that makes me unique because I‚Äôm sensitive and deep enough to think of these things and gay guys don‚Äôt seem to get hung up on things like that. Maybe they do. I believe they see the same things and maybe even repress it because there‚Äôs no use to get hung up on it. 

To add a little bit more to my backstory and feeling in limbo, I do have a goal to finish furnishing my house I‚Äôm renting and moving to my own house and not living in apartments anymore. I‚Äôm looking to finance a new car hopefully within the next year, I‚Äôd love to travel a little bit more but it seems like it‚Äôs moving at a very slow pace and then there‚Äôs never really anyone to share it with. 

I didn‚Äôt finish college and I don‚Äôt see any benefits going back to school since I‚Äôm still undecided about what I want to do. I don‚Äôt have any plans of buying or saving a house because I consider relocating to a bigger city quite often to Maxine the dating pool. 

I think my biggest aspiration is to find my soul mate and unfortunately a lot of time and energy has gone into that when I know I should t focus so hard on it because it will give off vibes that I‚Äôm desperate or clingy when a great opportunity presents itself. 

And I think a lot of that fear comes with the fear of aging and becoming less desirable due to the high standards I feel the gay community has. I feel like no one already wants me so I imagine myself when I get older and that‚Äôs a scary thought. 

I just wish I felt fulfilled instead in this constant state of in-between where I shouldn‚Äôt focus so much on a relationship but I‚Äôm having a hard time destracting myself from it. 

I know all my friends are starting to move on, or get into relationships, and will have families and kids before long and won‚Äôt have time for me so that bums me out a lot too. I don‚Äôt like to settle for being by myself but it‚Äôs absolutely necessary at this point. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs been going on I. My life lately and if anyone has a word of advice I could use it. ",lgbt
"What makes trans people, trans?","I am a cis male and am trying to learn more trans people and trans issues. My understanding of transgender is that the brain identity does not ""match"" the biological organs like vulva/penis, gonads, chromosomes, etc. For example, Chelsea Manning has said that she felt like an alien in her body before she transitioned. I think of Trans vs. cis in terms of ""not Matching vs. Matching"". As a cis person, my brains matches my sex organs - a trans persons's does not. Is this a good way of looking at it?

My Question is: what makes trans people, trans?

I don't believe in a female and male brain - there are just human brains. Why would person A (cis) feel comfortable having a penis but person B (trans) does not? I KNOW I am cis because I really do feeling 100% comfortable having a penis and a scrotum; but trans people feel deep down that their penis/scrotum doesn't belong to them, like it shouldn't be there?

I am a 16y male and my family has cause both me both sexual confusion and frustration. I am having a hard time talking about it with them.,"Alright, so this story is going to take a little setup. Firstly, i must say that I have some sever anxiety problems with a mix of Asperger which was diagnosed in my childhood, and my older sister (19) has some sever mental health problems relating to depression and anxiety.

She had original at around 16 came out as openly bi sexual, all fine and dandy except for one thing. She has a problem with pushing her own mental health disorders and other such things on me and my two other sisters. Over the course of this year she has professed both my younger sister (13) and my youngest sister (9) as being bi sexual and gay respectively. Since the two of them look up to here they have taken up the rolls of what she told them they are and won't let them think for themselves, or tells them that they most likely are lgbt.

 Now here is where my problem starts to come in. She has been doing this practically the whole year and over the course of the past two years the has been trying to get me to come out as gay/bi or asexual. Now in general I have not shown much interest in other people over the years and because of my introverted personality I have mostly stuck to myself and have not gotten into any relationships. While I myself know I am straight, because of her manipulation both my younger sisters and her have been backing me into a corner in almost a joking manner.

[RANT] I feel so frustrated and somewhat violated by the way staff treated me when I was hospitalized yesterday,"So, I started on testosterone a month ago.  On 1000mg of Reandron (I'm in Australia if you don't recognise the substance).  Anyway, about 2 weeks ago I noticed I was getting increasingly exhausted and was having a harder and harder time staying awake.  I ordered some modafinil online to help me finish the last few weeks of uni, which I have done before but not recently.  I thought I was just tired from uni.  

Fast forward to three days ago and I had progressed into not being able to stay awake at all.  I slept for 2 days straight and booked an appointment to see a doctor the coming morning to see why I could not function and to get my depo shot.  I also had a therapy appointment that morning, which I wanted to attend to rant about uni.  My gender specialist doctor is currently on vacation, so I couldn't see her.

Monday rolled around (day 3 of this total exhaustion) and I woke up early that morning and knowing I was not going to be able to wake up to an alarm or stay awake to see two doctors in two different suburbs, I took one of the pills.  I was still stuggling to stay awake, so I took two more over the course of a few hours.  

I didn't feel good an hour before I was planning on leaving the apartment, and wound up vomiting a transparent green liquid.  I was raised in an environment where you do not go and see a doctor unless you are going to die within 5 minutes.  So, I sat beside the toilet debating upon calling an abulance or not, when I suddenly realised that I was going to pass out then and there.  So I called an abulance.  

The paramedics were nice, and there was a very cute parametric student I would absolutely have flirted with if had I been able to form a coherent thought.  They took me to a nearby hospital which is where I have my frustrations with.  My name is still in the process of being changed, and unless I have had all sugeries done I am not able to have my gender marker on any offical document changed.  

They (the hospital staff) found my medicare details and every single doctor after that insisted upon calling me ""she and her"" and by my old name (I hate the term deadname tbh.  Sounds really harsh way to refer to a name I don't even respond to).  I have been living under my name and as male since I moved out almost a year ago, but since I have no contact with my father and my family are conservative Christians, I have not been able to change my name until I turned 18 just recently.  

Eventually, a doctor decided to discharge me.  Still unable to control my muscles properly or with enough strength to pick up a shirt without difficulty (an issue which progressed as my exhaustion progressed), I was told to find my own transport home and pointed in the general direction of the exit.  I managed to stumble out out and ordered an uber with a lot of confusion  (I was still unable to think coherently), following which I went into my apartment and passed out for 12 more hours.  I've been awake maybe an hour.  I had a shower and washed my hair, which (in addition to this post) has sapped my energy to the point where I'm ready to go back to sleep.  

I don't know of this is related to my T levels, and without anyone in this entire city versed in transgender healthcare I am stuck in a state of complete incapability for the next 2 weeks until there is someone that can take a look at me.  The doctors at the hospital say that I have no indiaction of an infection and they pumped me full of saline so my electrolytes are fine.  I was already planning on dropping out, but it looks like I probably will have to now.  My final exams are in about a week and I'm already behind.  I'm probably better off canceling my enrolment and transferring to a different uni and degree next year (the latter part of this was already a plan)

Frusturation,"A classmate of mine has brought up that she does not like gay people and that being gay is not correct during our math class. Our math teacher went to talk to her to suggest that she should not say that in school as there might be people who are gay in this room who has not voiced their sexuality, which would be just rude and mean to them,  and simply because he opposed that way of thinking. She argued that she should be able to voice her opinion, that it was because of her religion, and that if the math teacher was so open minded he should just accept that as her opinion and stop arguing against her.  The math teacher responds that as a teacher his job is to educate and that he would like to let her think if her religious goes against such things as sexuality to identify if a person is good or not, if it is the right way to base her thinking around. He ended the conversation there.

I decided to ask her to clarify what just happened out of curiosity. But she started to rant about how the teacher should not talk shit about her religion (even if he didn't) and started to victimize herself by saying that  shes just a student and can say whatever she wants but a teacher should not force ideas on her. And I started arguing with her just because I did not agree as well. 

It ended with another classmate just telling us to take it out of the room to stop disturbing the class. There were just so many things that she said that were hypocritical and it frustrated me that some one so ignorant was in my class. 

As an international school with an IB system our whole objective is to have a multicultural and open-minded system. (Some of you may know that one of the IB learner profile is open-minded.) I grew up in this school so I never experienced racism or homophobia that much, and it breaks me when I think about when I go to college abroad how many more ignorant people there would be there. I am a straight, Asian, teenager finishing my last year in high school, so might not be directly affected by this, but I know that some cultures are not open to Asians and also just thinking about how so many people are getting treated unfairly in the world because of their sexuality, race or other useless categorization without reason frustrates me indefinitely.

[TW] Please stop what you doing to read my plea,"First off, I don't know reddit. Hardly at all. I've seen it be a Haven and a hellhole for people online as it is basically it's own online world connected to real life. So I don't know where to post, how the guidlines work, or how reddit functions as a community. I don't even know if it's okay to post on this subreddit.

But I need my voice to be heard. Because I am afraid.

I don't often post like this, but guys, I'm scared. This country scares me. Our government is trying to wipe anyone who has any gender identity other than male or female off the planet. I don't care if you think that lgbt and transgender people should be accepted, because that's an opinion. Here's a fact. There are millions of us. Millions.

Millions. Yes you heard it, millions of legal LGBT+ citizens. We have fought, so, so hard for equel rights. The only thing we have EVER wanted, was the same rights as everyone else. We are all human. We are here. You can't just make, I'll say it again, MILLIONS of people just vanish. Not without a seperate continant or an ocean of blood.

Your political, religious, and personal beliefs do not change the fact that we exist and that we are human with our own beliefs, just like you. We are not the middle east, where just having a single gay thought will get you shot dead on the spot, or worse. And if you think I'm exaggerating about that, you don't pay enough attention in the world.

But I look at the current state of affairs, and I look ahead in time should things continue as they are, and all I see is violence, bloodshed, and in the most extreme scenerios, I even see civil war.

We had civil war over slavery (among other reasons as well) and it tore us apart. We came out of it for the better (sorta...), we shouldn't need to have one every time the question of ""should this human being be treated as a human being?"" comes up. Because the answer should always, ALWAYS be a unanimous ""YES!"". A yes shouted so loud that life on other plnets will hear it!  So loud that we'll wake God himself from his daytime nap. Anyone who says otherwise is probably a Hitler sympathiser. You know, the guy that DID cause an ocean of blood by trying to eradicate MILLIONS of people just for existing.

So now Trump is trying to make it so transgender people will legally cease to exist. And it will probably pass because the supreme court is under Republican rule. And there isn't much we can do about it. (If there is though, please tell me).

The underlying cause is voters. Not enough people vote. Too many people vote without doing research. We could have prevented this. We could have prevented EVERYTHING that has happened. Instead, we hid. We thought our vote didn't matter. We were afraid to voice ourselves, afraid that we would be attacked. And some of those fears are rightly justified. But we have to take the risk if we want better lives! For ourselves. For our kids and their kids.

More people need to vote, and they need to vote for what is right. Humanly right. Put your personal, political, and religious beliefs aside and ask yourself ""Do I want be hurt the way these other human beings are being hurt?""

If your answer was no, then MAKE THE EFFORT! The Maine Gubernatorial election is NEXT MONTH. Don't listen to the campaign ads, don't read the attack articles. Do your research. Find the best candidate who advocates for a friendly, more accepting and loving future for EVERYONE involved. For you, your friends, your neighbors, and for all those who are assaulted every day for just wanting peace of mind.

And when 2020 rolls around, DONT RE-ELECT TRUMP! For the love of common sense, if his own party doesn't fully support him, NEITHER SHOULD YOU! So DON'T!

YOUR VOTE MATTERS!
DONT BE AFRAID TO VOTE! 
YOU COULD CHANGE THE FATE OF MILLIONS OF LIVES FOR THE BETTER IF YOU'D STAND UP AND LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD!

I'm begging my family. I'm begging my friends. I'm begging the internet in it's entirety.

An Open Letter to Donald Trump,"We are indomitable, unquenchable fire,

Spare us your ire that an inferno cannot be doused.

We are the bearers of love, beacons of light,

Long have we weathered the darkest nights,

Born of solidarity, not fear, this will not end here.

We are more than these words, much more than your words,

We are herds of people, as real as you, and we will not be silenced.

Not by this, not by you.


We are defined by the one thing you lack above all else: our love and compassion.

We are the inventors of a language of love used to define that which you cannot comprehend,

out of spite, out of malice, out a fear, but you do not control us here.

Your power is not a noose with which to make a dictionary genocide,

Barely a yoke that we have bucked off, again, and again.

It will happen again.


We are an army of history's downtrodden,

beatten, neglected, murdered in hate.

War of an age to which you, a white man, will never relate.

And we persist.

Through bullets and shame, let the paper rain,

We have survived much worse and we will survive again.


With our heads held high, look to the sky,

you cannot ground us.

You cannot erase us.

We are queer. We are here.

We will never leave.

Forever in the Closet,"So I recently came out to my sister, who is just a very accepting natured person. Who, well, wasn‚Äôt surprised and pretty much already knew. With her reaction, it gave me hope that society had adjusted it‚Äôs perspective on such things as being part of the lgbtq+ community. It‚Äôs taken me awhile to validate my own feelings, love and accept myself for who I am and actually get to know myself and respect myself not just in the lesbian thing. Although I knew I couldn‚Äôt come out because I‚Äôm an athlete and it would take away chances at scholarships and representations, and limit my access to high-end resources and coaching that the scholarships would offer. A part of me must of believed a time would come when I would be able to come out, be free to be who I am, get a girlfriend, and all that other jazz; because when my mum told me everything she did tonight it destroyed some subconscious fantasy I had about it. 

Bit of a background story: my family, the only one that haven‚Äôt entirely disowned me yet. For reasons, that, would be too complicated to explain of why the multiple families I‚Äôve been apart of have. Bottom line is that it‚Äôs something I had no control over, and isn‚Äôt a reflection on who I am as a person rather on what people we have in this world. Anyway, they still push me to the side. Critique me at every turn. They‚Äôre constantly waiting for me to mess up, turn into some delinquent, go off the rails, I don‚Äôt even know at this point. Everything I do is taken under the microscope. They‚Äôre waiting for the day they can say they were right about me, in order to also say they were right about my mother. 

For the first time they‚Äôve acknowledged that my mother did a good job at raising me (of course attempting to take their own credit). They‚Äôre finally, almost, accepting me. It‚Äôs taken me to graduate high school at 14, have my first degree at 15, stop using anything to express myself like makeup and clothes, smile all the time, pretend I‚Äôm not sick all the time and jumping from specialist to specialist who tell me ‚Äúyou will die, you should have died, and you could die‚Äù, less my opinion, have the hell of my past go only leaving the mental and physical scares I mustn‚Äôt talk about, along with so much more. Though the real tipping point; getting my health fairly under control and stepping back onto track, becoming an athlete with times that will have me a strong qualification at nationals. Now I‚Äôm being treated almost like I‚Äôm one of them, and my mother has finally been acknowledged for not screwing me up. 

Now she tells me in a conversation tonight (after her parents had told her that she done well pretty much) that amongst many other things they were expecting me to ‚Äúbecome gay‚Äù and ‚Äúcatch gay‚Äù because of the way I was being raised. Now, I thought they were accepting of  the lgbtq+ community. I was wrong.. it seems like .. well they said if [name that‚Äôs not me] was gay they could never tell anyone because it would destroy their reputation, and that they couldn‚Äôt have them in this family. It would be a disgrace. 

They only tend to accept people, once a bunch of other people do, and once society does. I could be gay, if I became a respected athlete and everyone else did. Until then, I‚Äôd be a disgrace. 

I know a lot people would just tell me to be myself and screw them. That if they don‚Äôt accept me for who I am then they‚Äôre not people I want taking up space in my life. That true friends, or true family would love me no matter who I love. Because that‚Äôs the exact advice I‚Äôd give to someone else. Although this isn‚Äôt just a reflection on my failure as a person, but my mums ‚Äúfailure‚Äù as a mother. Which I refuse to do that to her, because she‚Äôs the best mother in the world and she‚Äôs like my best friend. She deserves to get told she‚Äôs done it right. I can‚Äôt turn around and say I‚Äôm gay now. 

Im thinking of waiting until they all die.. or wait until my cousin, who‚Äôs a big junior league football player, who I‚Äôm pretty confident is gay comes out ... although I don‚Äôt know if he ever will because he knows 110% the criticism he faces. Not even I‚Äôm sure if he‚Äôs father will completely disown him or not.

I wanted to tell my mother so bad tonight. I honestly thought she already knew, with hints she‚Äôs dropped and certain things she‚Äôs said. After tonight though.. I‚Äôm not sure she does. I know what she‚Äôd say though. She‚Äôd tell me to be me, do what makes me happy and fuck them. She‚Äôd push me to be myself, and I‚Äôm afraid of what would happen if I listened to that advice. I don‚Äôt want to complicate stuff, when I‚Äôve already had such a complicated and painful life.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for here... just advice, another way out. Someone to just tell me that it would just be the right thing for everyone if I just made another little sacrifice.

"Asexual, Gray-Sexual, Demi-Sexual help please?","So I'm Biromantic Asexual, but last night, I came across Demi and Gray-Sexual and now I'm confused on my part.

I know it's okay to be confused and to not know yet, but in all honesty not knowing something like this gives me crazy anxiety (I know I sound ridiculous, but that's aside the point.)

The reason I'm so confused is because both Demi and Gray sound a lot like me and my ideals of ""sex."" I'm not really down with having someone's something up in me ~~(fuck that shit m8)~~ for just the few minutes of pleasure and there are far too many risks to take. Of course, with that being said, I'm not shitting on people that do enjoy sex, I'm simply saying that I for one do not like the idea. 

I knew identifying myself as Asexual made people think that it was a giant ass red flag on my part on ANYTHING sexual, but that isn't the case. I like getting a bit intimate, and I still fantasize or whatever, but the truth is is that I never truly felt comfortable with the label of Asexual because of these very reasons, even though I know that it's still totally acceptable for an Ace to do those things. 

The thing is, I don't want to ever have sex until I have a very strong romantic bond and lots of trust and knowledge of the person, something that would put me under Demi-Sexual. But I also rarely actually WANT to have sex, which would make me a Gray-Sexual.

So my question is: **Is there some sort of middle ground between Demi-Sexual and Gray-Sexual? Or could you help me classify as either?**

Is it really the ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù or is it a curse?,"I am a 19 year old male and I identify myself as bisexual.

I think that people have a bad way of understanding that I do not like one gender more than the other. I know that I am attracted to both and that I shouldn‚Äôt have to choose. As a single man I can see why the quote ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù can be heard as fascinating and exciting because you can enjoy being with anyone you desire. However, what happens when it is time to get a bit serious and be in a relationship? How do you decide you want to spend the rest of your life with a male or female? To me that sounds that I will never be able to be emotionally and sexually content with myself. A relationship commonly consist of 2 people so what happens when I am feeling sexual attraction towards wanting to feel, just an example, a penis instead of vagina and vice versa? I feel that this is a reason I will never be truly happy because it‚Äôd feel like the other part of me is missing and this doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to find my self identity just yet.

I just came out as bisexual to my dad. It went pretty well!,"After two years of feeling attracted to men and women I finally came out to a family member. I've been out to my boyfriend and friends for a year now. (I am a 20 year old female) I came out to my dad and he was super sweet and said he just wants me to be happy in life. He also said whoever I end up with (man or woman) he will be supportive and happy. Which is awesome! I'm a little upset because he insisted I am not bisexual I am just bicurious because I have never been with a woman. He said I shouldn't call myself bisexual unless I've slept with a woman and dated her for at least a few months. This kind of made me feel invalid, but at least he has said he will support me no matter what.

Edit: I came out to the my mom and my brother too and they both took it pretty well. They didn't seem to mind that I'm bi, but they weren't negative about it! 

Although my mom thought this meant my boyfriend and I are now going to have an open relationship. I explained to her that that is not what we plan to do, it's just that over the past few years I came to the realization that I am attached to women as well as men.

Overall a success!

I feel so relieved. :)",lgbt

Nerd some clarity,"Hi everyone. Firstly please don't judge me harshly, I'm (37 F) just starting to figure things out. A friend of mine (28 non binary) recently was chatting about their husband and said something about accepting them being binary. They asked me how my husband handled it. I was confused what they meant, then they said ""well you're gender fluid"". Again, I didn't get it. Then they got awkward and asked if identified as female all the time cuz they had a feeling I was fluid and that's why they never used a female pronoun with me. After they explained it, it got me thinking. I called my mother and asked her why she used to say ""my son (I have a unisex name)"" as a joke my whole life. She said that at times she saw me as a boy, in the toys I liked, the clothes I wore and my mannerisms. I just always thought I was weird. I am straight and I apologize of I offend anyone, but what little I knew about gender fluidity, I assumed sexual preference would also have to be fluid. I'm now questioning my identity and if anyone can help me I'd really appreciate it. Tia",lgbt

Where do we go from here?,"I am using a throwaway just to be safe.  Also sorry if this is a wall of text or if I say anything that offends anyone, but we are out of our depth here. My sweet, quirky, quiet 15 year old cousin came out to my immediate family (my sister, mom, dad, brother and I) last week as a lesbian.  I was so happy she finally felt safe and comfortable enough to tell us.  We let her know that we love her and it's cool, we support her and it was all around a happy family time. The problem is  (and I am feeling like *what century is it* typing this) her parents are not accepting and it is becoming a huge issue. 

My aunt and uncle are extremely conservative in all ways, some might say fanatical.  They co-run a church and go 3 times a week.  Dad is a youth pastor &amp; to give you a quick idea of what we're dealing with he does not believe in self-esteem or mental illness or privacy for children.  (Being depressed and being happy are not real things, if you have God's love you should always be joyful or something like that) They feel very strongly about their beliefs. Anyway, she had an outpouring of everything she's been going through for the last few years..  In 8th grade she told her father she was bisexual with the aid/support of her best friend at the time (she said she was still not 100% sure of whether she was bi or lesbian at the time) and he told her to wait until her mom got home and they would discuss.  What actually happened was they sat her down and told her she just *thinks* she likes girls because she never had many friends when she was little so she can't tell the difference between friend feelings and I like you feelings. Then she was not allowed to hang out with the friend who was there when she told them anymore. So they denied her feelings and isolated her.  Fast forward awhile.

Late into freshman year of high school she was grounded from her phone for 6 months. None of us knew why, I assumed she had a social media account (which is forbidden in their house) and they are very strict with her so that's why it was taken away.  Turns out she forgot her phone when she went to youth group one night and mom went through it and found texts that she hadn't deleted yet to a friend talking about liking some girl at school. So she was confronted and asked ""are you still having these feelings?"" and told that this was not acceptable. So she was scared and she lied and said she was just confused again because there was a guy that had been harassing her at school (there was not) and so she didn't really like girls, but she doesn't like guys either.   They half-bought the story.  So no phone for 6 months and they changed her number as well and told her not to give it out.  They regularly go through her phone now that she has it back.  Her parents told her they wanted her to see a counselor about this and she agreed but only on the condition that it be doctor-patient confidentiality so they couldn't know everything that was said.  So counseling didn't happen because they said no, you will speak to someone who shares our beliefs and no keeping secrets from them.  They told her she can tell them anything and she should trust them.  

As of right now she says her most of her teachers know, most people at school/her friends know and now we (small portion of the family) know.  She has a girlfriend who happens to attend youth group with her (their way of getting to hang out because otherwise she is questioned about who/what/when/why she wants to hang out with any given teenage girl).  So essentially she is ""dating"" this girl directly under her parents' noses.   However, as she says her mom and dad don't know and can't know or this relationship and her life as she knows it is pretty much over. 

But since she told us, she has been calling and trying to get us to drive her and said gf to the mall or a movie to celebrate their one month anniversary.  This is where it's getting sticky.  We've put her off for a few days trying to decide how to handle this.  Please understand,  I would drive her anywhere in a heartbeat. I want to support her in every way possible.  But it's one thing for us to be there for her when she needs to talk , and keep her ""secret"" and let her know that she is perfectly within her rights to be who she is.  It's another thing to actively go behind her parents backs and take her on these dates she is not supposed to be going on.  I feel like she is going to feel so defeated when we have to say we can't do this for her.  Like she finally got the courage to get support from family and now we have to turn the request down. 

The best way I think to explain it would be to tell her that if her parents had a rule of no dating until she's an adult, we wouldn't be willing to help her sneak around whether she wanted to go out with a boy or a girl. That's not exactly the case but it might help put it into perspective.  Also, if her parents find out we know and we are helping her disobey them, she will not be allowed to be around us.  I don't want her isolated further.  Same as if they know everyone at school knows, they will pull her out of that school.  I also thought about offering her a compromise of okay, we can drive her but like me/my sister or me/my boyfriend kind of going along to the mall or movie too.  That way we can't ever be told she was left unchaperoned on some sneaky date. 

I don't know. I don't want her to lead double lives, but she is.  I'm worried about this being damaging to her mentally, but her parents don't believe in mental health so there will be no argument there.  I don't want her shipped off to some scary camp. I don't want her not to be allowed to talk to us and I don't want her to feel like we are being hypocritical (we support you but we can't help you date??). How do we go about supporting her past the initial coming out? Any help is appreciated!",lgbt

I had an uncomfortable interaction with my RA and I'm not sure what to do about it.,"Background: I'm gay but don't really ""show"" it in anyway and so people assume I'm straight.   
   
I live with 6 other people in an on campus apartment and on of those 6 people happens to also be my RA. Up until now I've considered him a friend and have felt fine hanging out with him and interacting with him, but this past Friday I had an interaction that was uncomfortable and awkward and has made me not want to interact with him anymore.   
   
I came back from a party on Friday to find 4 of my roommates, my RA being one of them, in the living room talking and hanging out so I joined them. Eventually one of them asked me how the party was and I responded that it was good but had an awkward interaction when someone tried to set me up with this guy who I wasn't very interested in and so I left the party. Once I said this my RA looked taken aback and/or shocked and started on a very weird conversation. He basically kept saying that I wasn't actually gay, how I'm straight, and how it was gross that someone tried to set me up with a guy at the party. He kept asking me if I was really gay and once I emphatically said yes he seemed unsatisfied with my answer and then asked everyone else there if I was really gay and once they said yes as well he said something along the lines of ""Aw man, I can't believe your gay.""   
   
This conversation was quick but really uncomfortable and I just stayed in my room for the rest of the night. Every day since then he's seemed more stand-offish and distant like he doesn't want to interact with me. The whole thing has just made me feel not comfortable around him anymore.   
   
I feel like I should bring this up with him but him being an RA and in a position above me makes me really hesitant to do so and I know that he as a person is not very receptive to criticism and I'm worried he might respond poorly and it might have consequences.   
   
So I guess I'm just looking for input for whether I'm blowing this out of proportion and if not what should I do. ",lgbt

Coming out as pan,"As a child, you are sweet, innocent, clueless and don't see anything wrong with anyone unless they steal your favorite toy. I was one of those kids. I had Naruto action figures that I would play with constantly (I has no idea who they were at the time). But I would (i fucking hate that I'm saying this) would make Naruto and Saska kiss. I didn't think it was weird at all in my mind. I had always liked being happy with people they loved. So when I started feeling attraction to guys and girls I thought I was bisexual. And then I learned about the whole gender spectrum and it blew my world. I loved how people identified as all of these genders. And I realized something bigger; I was pansexual. I found out I was pansexual at 14. Now the problem is that my mom was severely conservative and thought gay marriage was ridiculous. So coming out wasn't really an option at the time. But I had came out to friends about it and they supported me, for the most part. At 17, I was confident enough to tell my mom. I had a fall back plan if it didn't work: either go with my grandma or one of my friends. But I was one of the lucky ones. My mom was very accepting and said her feelings didn't affect the way she felt about me. I know this isn't the case for anyone that comes out and I do symposium for anyone who wasn't accepted. But hear me when I say this: if you come out and you are proud of your sexuality, you are very strong and you will make it through your hardship. You just have to find the right people.",lgbt

Unintentional Conditioning?,"Hi everyone - just had a random thought while talking to my boyfriend the other day about our childhoods. Was curious if anyone experienced anything similar (for clarity‚Äôs sake, we‚Äôre both men). I‚Äôve always been fairly certain I‚Äôve always been gay, but for whatever reason was thinking about ‚Äúwhat could have been a  cause for this?‚Äù and something popped into my head that I thought was funny if it was true, but fairly certain it‚Äôs just coincidental.

Growing up, would regularly watch movies and tv shows with my family. Any time there was ever a known scene with nudity coming up, or if it was a surprise, would always be quickly told to cover my eyes, hide under the blanket, etc. In contrast, there was no such need to cover my eyes when there were shirtless/half-naked men on the screen ready to be ogled. I wonder if this over the course of many years conditioned my brain to be afraid of the female form. Like Pavlov with his dogs and his bell, any time I see boobs I get a tiny heart attack. My brain screams, ‚ÄúAhh danger! Shut your eyes or get in trouble!‚Äù It‚Äôs not rational in any way, but it‚Äôs still my initial reaction. Did anyone have a similar experience/results growing up?

i have a friend and we are very close . i actually only met her 10 months ago. We have grown to be very close friends . she has become one of the best friends and people ive ever loved so deeply. the nature of our firendship is very loving . She is a naturally sweet and compassionate person. You know those people who just love others naturally ? thats her . Shes literally the purest person ive ever met. when i first met her she always invited me over her apartment, she loves hanging with friends and having sleep overs and having some beers . though when i met her she was new to the area , she had just moved into town and i was the only person blocks away from her to be down with all her cool adventure .( she has tons of friends now ) but thats how it started, and ever since we just became literally one person . now its just normal for us to spend every minute together, she will come over my house and suprise mewith a pizza pie when i was feeling low, and we would just lay on the couch and watch funny videos on youtube. or she will sleep over and we will talk all night in my bed, or she will come over and chill for the night and id cook her dinner. and we can just talk and talk and talk. and she really values our friendship. ALOT. one time we had a little fight and she literally said to me "" can we please stay friends , because i love you very much ?"" lol and over the summer i even went with her to her home state for two weeks and spent time with her and her friends and family. she invited others to come on the trip as well, but i turned out to be the only one with the circumstance to go and we had so much fun! so yeah . best friends literally playing every stereo type of what best friends do. lol but then something happened to me . i.... fell in love with her . i fell in love with my best friend. and it was super scary because im so close with her and so deep in her life, how the heck would i overcome this in a timely matter ???!!! i have had deep romantic or sexual attractions for other women before and i have dated women before , so im not scared because i had the feelings , im familiar with them. i got scared because its with my best friend . GET READY

so in a deep conversation at a cafe with her i talked to her about my past alittle more . and i told her i used to date girls ( yes i havent dated a girl in forever , school, college and work, i havent dated a guy since freshmen year of college lol ) so i told her i used to date girls and she told me about her past alittle more in depth. 1 week later we are texting at like 1 am in morning and within the convo she texts me saying "" so i used to date girls too "" and i said oh .. cool!

and through out that month she brought it up like 2 other times more with me about me being involved with other women. things like"" how many girls did you date?"" "" did your mom ever know you dated girls ?"" and id give her number and i responed ""no actually my mom never knew, just my brother and my close aunt "" and id ask her "" how about you?"" and she says "" my mom and brother and entire family never knew either , just one of my bestfriends back home"" this conversation took place while she had to crash on my couch cause she was having car problems and couldnt drive home. she was downstairs texting me this . so i ask her if i can come down and see her and she says yes. and we talked about on the couch and dark parts of our past and we cuddled . LOL which was literally the best feeling in the world for me. speed forward from that night, next month she tells me she had a sex dream about me and that it was very detailed into the movements and sounds she says . and then she says "" so now you can never say i dont think you are pretty and beatiful""

[TW] Trying to improve myself as a person,"I had a heated argument with a person a few months ago and it's seriously affecting my mental health. I've thought about killing myself over this - among other things.

I was having a discussion about how my interactions with a specific gender have affected how I interact with others of said gender and which is why I've just started seeing everyone as People. Obviously my sexual preference means I favor one over the other. 

Well the lesbian person that was in the room didn't like what I was saying and assumed I meant females were inferior to males - not what i was saying at all! She demanded that I describe her in line with what I had just said. I called her a person. When she pressed I added a butch person. She went off on me saying that I was essentially saying she wasn't a woman and that using the word ""butch"" had been extremely insulting.

I do admit to calling her a racist when I tried to compare her previously [months ago] saying ""I don't trust white people; I don't trust them as far as I can through them"" jet still having white friends [which I KNOW she said because after that she walked off to her car leaving the other 3 of is in awkward silence]. Of course I misquoted her in the argument in question as having said ""f- white people"" ... the night ended with her asking me either I was wrong or she was racist to which I answered ""both"" because I realized I misquoted her but still considered the actual quote racist. 

I've lost my boyfriend and he's lost his friends when he initially sided with me when she talked to them about this - among other things. I don't know what she said and I never got a chance to tell my side.

TL:DR Was I wrong for having called a lesbian woman a person? Is ""butch"" that bad a thing to say? I never said she wasn't a woman but I also refused to tell her she WAS because that wasn't what the conversation was supposed to be about and as bad as I feel that she went through something like that, it wasn't my fault someone else told her she wasn't a woman. I know I should give up on those friends I lost but it really hurts to be outcast over this. I guess all I can really do is learn from it.",lgbt

PSA: Generic Atripla may have serious mood-altering side effects including suicidal thoughts.,"I just want to share this story in the hopes that no one else has to experience it first-hand. TLDR at the bottom.

My partner is HIV positive and has been taking Atripla for a number of years. His Doctor recently switched him over to the generic version of the drug with no warning of the switch and no warning of any potential side effects. Unbeknownst to him, the change started causing a serious deep depression that greatly affected his personal and professional life. He became distant, quiet, and lethargic, and revealed to me that he was experiencing moments where he very seriously considered suicide, as it was the only way he could think of ""ending his suffering."" He had thought about which way he would do it, and even had a dream where he sat in the closed garage and left the car running.

Fortunately he had a close friend ask him if he had any recent prescription changes that may be causing his depression, and he went back to his doctor and was put back on his old prescription. We noticed a drastic change back to normal within days.

I am posting this here in case anyone else is put in the same situation and doesn't have the resources to figure it out before it's too late. He was give no warning whatsoever, he was just given different drugs when he picked up his pills.


TL;DR: Partner was put on generic Atripla without warning, and it caused serious depression that nearly convinced him to commit suicide. ",lgbt

I want to help out, i want to try and make a difference but i feel like my voice can not be herd until i old enough to vote. There are so many people who want to support the LGBT+ community  but they are either not of age to vote, and or their community does not have enough people to back up this giant family.
     I have tried to help out by doing activities online, such as petitions, writing about my perspective, or contacting my local government. I feel like i am not able to help out enough. 
     TL;DR How can i help the LGBT+ community as a minor and when there aren‚Äôt enough followers locally. ",lgbt

I have existential issues that I need to tell strangers on the internet about and hope to get some advice. Thanks.,"Okay so, hi. I‚Äôm 21, female and pansexual, I guess. I always knew I‚Äôm attracted to women too, but recently I discovered that I absolutely don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs going on between the legs of a person that I think is attractive. So, that‚Äôs cool and I‚Äôm happy about it. But there‚Äôs something going on in my head for quite a while that makes me feel uncomfortable and like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. Me and my boyfriend are together for almost two years now and I absolutely LOVE him, like I want to grow old with him and just spent the rest of my life with that wonderful person and I can say he loves me as much. Well I guess that‚Äôs the jackpot right? But somehow my brain does crazy things. Like I mentioned before I‚Äôm also attracted to women but I never made experience with that besides from making out with a few females. And I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Like I have that strange desire to have a romantic relationship with another woman. I want more than a friendship, but like less than the relationship I have with my boyfriend? I don‚Äôt know how to describe that feeling. I also experienced having crushes on other people and wanting to go deeper than a ‚Äúregular‚Äù friendship but still having a stronger bond with my boyfriend. Whenever that happened I tried to suppress these feelings and told nobody about it. I would never ever cheat on my boyfriend but I honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way of exploring those fantasies. My boyfriend is very ‚Äûjealousy‚Äú. He‚Äôs not putting me in a cage or something, I can do(almost) whatever I want and he trusts me but because of his insecurities he‚Äôs constantly worried too. I thought about telling him, asking him if a polyamorous relationship is possible but I‚Äôm way too scared because I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings and it definitely will. So here I am, telling strangers on the internet what‚Äôs going on in my head and hoping, that anybody will respond to my way too long post. Does anybody experience the same feelings/the same situation or just have some advice? Please be kind. Have a nice day. Thank you.",lgbt

"Hi friends, I am hoping to get the perspectives of as many LGBTQ people as I can","Hello reddit,

Long story short, I am a straight, cis-gender female and I try as hard as I can to be a good ally to the LGBTQ+ communities. I was talking to a friend of mine about how we wish there were more young adult literature for LGBTQ+ youth (similar to books like Simon vs. the Homosapien's Agenda), and my friend suggested I write one, as I write all the time for fun. I thought this was a great idea, but I wanted to make sure I got as many opinions as possible from LGBTQ+ individuals to ensure that I am not overstepping anything, speaking over people, etc. 

In that light, my friend and I created a survey that I am using to attempt to make sure my information is correct. I have posted the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN1RqKXQR1vJ5zbBpVUFXki87gg7T-o71ip5yFUlFraz9daQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) \- I am really sorry if this kind of post is not welcome here, but I love reddit and have been able to get a wide range of viewpoints from people on here for my work before, and so I was hoping that some of you would be interested in taking this survey.

I am tired,"It's been a while since i actually talked to anyone about this. 
I am a transgender mtf girl from the middle east
I am in the closet,  very deep in the closet
No one knows about my story except my wife, and 2 friends,  knowing that one of them has cut ties with me. 
I live in fear,  and i am very paranoid. 
There is a war inside me,  between the dire need to express myself,  and the extreme panic i get whenever someone suspect who i really am. 
I am saving up to leave my country ASAP. 
I even applied for the DIV program (the american citizenship lottery). 
Sadly i know how hard could it be to actually win the lottery,  and i am not making enough many to travel any soon. 
The fear of losing everything and get killed is really ugly,  as i know no one could actually mourn me!  They will just say a sinner has passed away after receiving his deserved punishment. 
I hate the suit i have to wear everyday to work, and having to wear heavy clothes even in summer just to hide that i am shaving, 
And being teased just for acting a little girly or being a bit shy. 
Lately i became very alcoholic person!  Luckily alcohol is legal to buy where i live,  eventhough it's illegal to drink publicly. 
My greatest wish,  is just to feel like myself,  is that very huge to have?!. 
I just want tp scream heeeeey!!  I am a girl!!!!  Get me out!!. 
But those bastard with their fairy tails wont let me survive afterwards. 
I wish lgbt communities will give more attention to gays and transgender in muslim countries,  they suffer daily,  with every breath coming out. 
I dont mind dying,  i am exhausted already,  i just wanna be remembered as a good person earning his living and would never harm anyone!  Not as a devil and criminal.

Have never dated anyone before. Sort of like three different guys. Nervous and confused... what do I do?,"Hey all, high school guy here. In a bit of a pickle and want to vent a bit. Is it normal to have a crush on more than one guy, and how do I deal with it? 

I sort of like a few different people right now, but I‚Äôm not sure who to focus on because they‚Äôre most likely straight statistically speaking. In addition to that, I feel like they‚Äôre all kinda out of my league because I‚Äôm a huge band nerd. I sort of like this lacrosse player, we were at a party together for my other friend‚Äôs birthday, and my friend was like ‚Äúhey (name) can you carry up the snacks? And (name) can you carry the blankets up? And (me) can you carry my laptop up?‚Äù And I was like jokingly like ‚Äúhaha guys someone needs to carry me up too haha‚Äù and this guy just swoops in like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you‚Äù and carries me up the stairs and is like ‚Äúall those deadlifts from training really came in handy‚Äù

Like
Why would this guy I‚Äôve only known for a couple hours before this just do that 

Sometimes in school I say hi to him and he says sup back, but maybe he forgot my name or something...? Sometimes I‚Äôve noticed he‚Äôll steal a glance but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just coincidental. I‚Äôve got him on Snapchat now, but I‚Äôm not sure how to hang out with him again because we don‚Äôt have any classes and only have a mutual friend. 

Then, a friend of mine in band I kind of like too. I accidentally came out to him when we all went bowling one night, so at least he knows, and he was like ‚Äúhey want to see a cool Snapchat hack lol‚Äù and took my phone and added himself and was like ‚ÄúWOAH HAHA COOL HUH‚Äù and asked me last night if I was going to homecoming today. He invited me to come but didn‚Äôt specify who else he invited. He just went, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there will be other band kids there‚Äù, so...? He‚Äôs been friendly, but I never really notice any signs from him and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Finally, there‚Äôs this one guy that I think might be showing some signs to me. He‚Äôs really chatty to everyone else, but whenever I would try talking to him about whatever, he‚Äôd give short two word answers or whatever. Lately he‚Äôs been kinda touching me lately, not in a weird way, but like a ‚Äúhey man‚Äù and a touch on the shoulder or whatever. On the band field during practice I notice him looking sometimes and he always seems to laugh at jokes I‚Äôll tell someone next to me as if he was listening for it. Before our football game last night, I was setting up the drum line stands in the bleachers, and I notice him, for some reason, on his phone at the wall near the door kinda looking my way, and when I came over he asked if he could help in anyway. He‚Äôs been trying to talk to me more lately, but idk.

Problem is, I kind of like all three of these guys, but not completely yet. I want to just be friends with them first and try to get to know them better, but what should I do? What does anything mean? Help. Thanks!",lgbt

Can the Trump Administration Retroactively Reverse Birth Certificate Changes?,"This is a real question, can the Trump administratively retroactively revoke gender changes that have already occurred under previous administrations? When the explicit guidelines of the federal government said that the changes could be made once specific criteria (that have varied over time) were met. I want to know whether Ex Post De Facto law would prevent such a radical shift. As what I have read to believe, seems to indicate that Congress would likely have to approve such a change too. It could not just be the work of the administration as well.

P.S. I realize I should have wrote document changes not ""birth certificate"". Since only states can issue such documents. But still, the question stands for passports and social security cards

Walked in on my younger bro and his friend kissing,"Hi, I'm 15M and my younger brother is 11.

Really sorry if this is the wrong place to post.

Just to clear things up I'm in no way against being gay etc. Me and my brother are very close he still sleeps in my bed when he's scared n' stuff and he is my little brother so of course I'm supportive of him.
I'm mainly making this post because I don't know what I should do...
So first let me say that our parents are extremely homophobic (like the majority of parents are) they always have to voice their disgust with a 20 minute lecture on how ""gross and ""wrong"" it is anytime we're watching a show and there's a gay kiss scene or something. me and my brother have always just ignored it (I just see it as it's none of my business) 

A few days ago bro brought his friend over ( he's 12, and they've been friends since 2nd-3rd grade. Me and him are also really close he's kind of like a 2nd little brother to me he's a great kid, I also happen to know that his parents share the same views toward being gay as mine. I'm Just gonna call him Pikachu to make it easier lol) 

They went up to bro's room which was perfectly normal. A few hours later mom asked me to ask them what they wanted for dinner (ordering Chinese) so I went up stairs to ask and anyway when I went in to bro's room Pikachu and bro were sitting on his bed holding hands and kissing. I did scream a little (well not really scream but I can't think of a better word) because it came as a shock, which startled them I think. Immediately bro started crying and pikachu was clearly a nervous wreck and also looked as if he was going to cry, so I just went in and closed the door. I was trying to calm down bro by hugging him and telling him it's ok but he was terrified that they'd find out. Pikachu grabbed his stuff and was out the door despite me asking him to please wait because I was afraid mom and dad who were down stairs and would notice him bolting down the stairs and out the door would figure out something was up. I was trying my best to calm bro down who was clinging on to me and shaking like crazy he kept saying ""that mom was gonna kick him out"" and then to make things worse dad came into the room which made bro cry even more. Dad started asking questions what was going on and if Pikachu did something, I just told him that they got into a fight which he didn't seem to buy at first but I think he definitely thinks that now (overheard mom and dad gossiping) so that was the end of that for now, Later on me and bro talked and of course I told him it was fine to be gay and that I wouldn't let mom kick him out (I don't think she'd actually do that, at least I'd like to hope so) he was still really upset and cried a few times mainly because Pikachu wouldn't text him back, I tried calling him once to make sure he was ok and got home safe but he didn't answer.

Fast forward to today, Pikachu won't talk to bro and bro's a mess, he's really upset and he's been crying on and off because he's extreamly shy and gets really nervous around people, and pikachu is the only friend he's ever had not to mention they're best friends, they do everything together, they play games together, sleepovers all that stuff and I feel like absolute trash because I feel like i destroyed their relationship. I tried texting him a few times telling him that it was ok and I'm not gonna tell anyone but he won't respond at all.
I really don't want bro to lose him as a friend, He was really good for bro he was a great friend so once again I feel miserable having ruined it all and I can't seem to do anything to fix it and it's driving me crazy. So does anyone have any advice on how to fix this? Literally anything would be great.",lgbt

What's the motivation behind identifying as queer? What's the political endgame?,"Hi, I'm curious about the whole queer thing, what it means and whether I should support it or not. In a way I could see identifying as queer (as a gay guy) as partially going back into the closet. Queer doesn't give people the information they'd like to know, that I'm a man attracted to other men. On the other hand, what do I really have in common with other sections of the gay community apart from being grouped together for oppression? I mean, as a masculine acting guy attracted only to typical 'twinks' I often feel alienated from other gay men when discussing attraction. Men who don't match the narrow segment of people I'm attracted to may as well be women to me, so being grouped with other men just because I'm attracted to 'men' is in a sense extremely arbitrary.

This is all very confusing, so I'd appreciate if someone could explain 'queer' to me. Thanks",lgbt

I‚Äôm so fucking tired of defending my identity,"I didn‚Äôt ask for my identity to be politicized. I didn‚Äôt ask to be assigned the wrong gender. I didn‚Äôt ask to know, in my heart of hearts, that I was meant to be a woman. I didn‚Äôt ask for any of this fucking shit. I didn‚Äôt ask for dysphoria, or the depression that comes with it, or the fucking way just looking in the mirror can make me want to hurt myself. 

I just. I am *so tired* of people concern trolling about trans people.

‚ÄúI only *care* about trans people. You transgenders commit so much more suicide than the average population; you‚Äôre clearly just in need of help, and you need to not be encouraged to be transgender!‚Äù

That‚Äôs the argument that kills me the most. Not the people who just admit they hate me, or openly deny that I am who I say I am. No, it‚Äôs people who pretend to care to mask their transphobia. 

And it‚Äôs horse shit. 

I can provide all the research, all the studies. Every piece we‚Äôve got. The consensus of every medical association, the WHO, the APA ‚Äî does it matter?

Of course it doesn‚Äôt. 

I tire myself trying to defend my identity. 

Trying to prove I am who I say am. That who I am is real.

"I'm (15f) in love with lesbian best friend (14f), but I dont think she intrested","For some context, I'm a bi (mostly towards women thou) and also recently came out to my family. So this girl I've been friends with since 6th grade, and let's call her Q for simplicity's sake. Back in 7th grade I realized I liked women and in early 8th grade Q realized she was a lesbian. We are now both in 9th grade and I realized I developed feeling for her. I then told our mutual friend, let's call her W, about this, I then asked her if she could find out if there was ever a chance of Q liking me back.

 Yesterday at a carnival, P asked Q if she ever thought of dating me and P responded saying she didn't think our personalities would work out if we were dating. She's pretty calm and collective, ie the mom friend, while I'm a lot more spontaneous and excitable. Although, I'm very shy around everyone else. What do I do in this situation, as I'm agarid even if I did tell her it might make things too weird for us.

(UPDATE) Transphobic friend's response to finding out i'm trans,"[(Update to this thread)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/9p3jv1/transphobic_friends_response_to_finding_out_im/)

I finally got to come out to my friend properly, I went to his place yesterday to talk. He was very accepting, he asked me what I wanted and what I am, I told him my whole story, how i'm FTM etc. He asked about my sexuality, I explained that I still like guys. 

He put it together in his head and said ""Oh so you're a guy and you like guys? So you'd date gay guys? Gay guys seem nice, i've never met a gay guy before but they seem.....nice"". It seems like he was just trying to be positive about my dating life. And so I said ""Hi, nice to meet you. Now you *have* met a gay guy."" And he laughed. 

He fist bumped me and told me that's what guys do, I asked him to teach me the ""guy handshake"" because I never knew how to do it. He taught me and we practiced a few times till I perfected it. I honestly wanted to cry after that.

The message here is, if you're worried about coming out to someone who you think won't be accepting, you would be surprised! The people I most feared coming out to were the easiest and most accepting. The ones I thought would understand it best are the ones who outed me to multiple people and that's not supportive, as much as they say they're supportive. ",lgbt

"I [FtM 25] am applying to professional jobs. I don't pass, but I have been trying. I haven't got a job offer, and I feel it's because of my appearance. What do I do?","Over the past two years I \[FtM 25\] have been applying to professional jobs in administration, content writing, and business fields. I have not received a job offer, and I feel like my attempt at passing in interviews is affecting my ability to secure a long-term job.

I have feminine business professional clothing, and plenty of experience to secure a job in these fields, especially after two years of constantly applying for jobs. I have a great resume. I have long, but relatively well-kept hair, and excellent hygiene. I have not started HRT, and have not had any surgery, and I don't plan to for awhile.

I feel like my gender identity is getting in the way of my employment opportunities. What can I do to mitigate that effect? When I asked my father (who doesn't understand or acknowledge my gender identity) for advice, he told me that it has no place in the business world. It hurt to hear that, but after so few call-backs, over two years of constantly applying for jobs, I get the sinking feeling that he isn't wrong.

My view is that it's not going to get better, and that the best course of action would be to stop trying to pass and go back into the closet for my professional life. Cut my hair short. Wear masculine clothing. Present as a straight-white-male, and utilize that privilege to secure a long-term position where I could become successful.

I have a job interview on Wednesday, for a job that I think could kick-start my career.  I don't want to go back into the closet, but if it means securing a position that will let me put away money to support a family, I will.

I am thankful for any thoughts this community could provide. I don't know what to do.",lgbt

I have a friend who just sent a message to a group we have (4 people) at 8:30 AM saying something like this

&amp;#x200B;

""I have something to say""

&amp;#x200B;

""(name here) you already know this""

&amp;#x200B;

And then he sent a picture of a girl coming out of a boy costume. It's clearly his own way of saying ""I'm trans"", I have no problem with that, my problem comes just here. I already knew, the friend that knew, told me like one week ago, and I already had deep suspicions that something was going on. The thing is I don't know what to say to him at all, I as a person always stay away from the ""default reply"" to things, and as he knows me, he WILL notice if I say something that's out of my ""character"", and he would probably get sad if he noticed.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it would be insensitive to just send a ""I can help with whatever you want!"" reply, there would be no ""me"" in that reply, it would be just a reply, it would be empty(?

&amp;#x200B;

With the way he said it I don't know if he's expecting a reaction, or if he just said it and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

He's super depressive, and I don't want him to get sad because of me, he took a gigantic amount of courage to tell me this, so I want to say something, but I don't know what to say while staying away from the responses like ""Yeah! You go!"" ""Don't worry we are here"". I want to convey that feeling, but not with those typical words as he will notice I hesitated when writing the response.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't sleeped at all the last two days, so my ability to create witty-half-serious-half-joking-full-honest responses is totally fucked, all I need is inspiration.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a socially awkward teen who didn't have any friends until 8 months ago, this is just too much for me to handle alone :(

&amp;#x200B;

What would you say to him?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I go with the default reply and pray to god he doesn't notice?

Gender Identity and being a Lesbian,"Hi all. I'm a 18 year old gay girl and I've been having a little bit of a problem with how I view myself lately. I don't really like being a girl. I'm very sure I'm not trans, though. I thought I might be when I was 13, and ultimately I realized I'm not. I'm very comfortable with my body, no dysphoria whatsoever. While physically I have no problem, I don't really 100% identify with being a girl. I'm not super masculine, but I'm far from traditionally feminine. I don't wear makeup. I don't care about fashion. I'm pretty straightforward. I'm not an extremely emotionally driven person. More of my friends are guys. I speak from my chest which gives me a lower voice than other girls. I absolutely hate dresses. They can all burn in a great big fire. At the same time I don't like traditionally masculine clothing much. I feel like a lot of what I just listed are stereotypes or shallow in general. Idk, I just don't feel right. My name is feminine, and it's pretty, but I much rather go by my last name. I love being at work because my nickname there is a play on my last name. 

Despite what seems to be a common disregard of labels, I find labels to be comforting in a way. I have a strict label for every part of my identity. They can change, but I don't like not knowing what to call a feeling or situation at any given moment. I've struggled trying to pin down how I feel for months, and nothing has felt right.

Anybody's input is appreciated, and thank you for reading my ramblings. :)",lgbt

"Feeling weird, lost and empty. Parents disowned/disinherited me.","So my parents have never been cool with my homosexuality and it‚Äôs always been the cause of a lot of cut off conversations, begging, arguing, evangelism, conversion therapy, the whole nine yards. Eventually when I moved out, I walked away from so many conversations that my parents gave up and just stopped asking me. And I made no effort to remind them that I still hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúchanged‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt something that overly upset me and it didn‚Äôt prevent me from having a relationship with my parents. 

Well, a few days ago my mom noticed a discreet pride tattoo that I‚Äôve had for a few months now. We argued a bit about whether my homosexuality is my ‚Äúchoice‚Äù and then I left. The next morning I got a lengthy and nasty letter comparing me to an addict, and my severely alcoholic, cross dressing uncle. She made good on a threat that she has always hung over me, that she would disinherit me. I basically responded by saying that if they didn‚Äôt want to treat me like a daughter then they don‚Äôt get me as a daughter, and I would no longer be attending family events or speaking with them unless they had an emergency. My mom said something really hurtful to my only brother so now he‚Äôs angry at me too. I will be picking up some stuff and documents I had been storing at their house tonight after they are asleep. Then they won‚Äôt be contacting me anymore, which I know is best for me. 

I‚Äôve always maintained a pretty brave, logical, indifferent attitude about my parents disapproval of me, but now it‚Äôs really sinking in and over the last few days I have felt really weird. Just empty, lost, tired. I know logically that I‚Äôm making a good move and that I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, that my parents don‚Äôt deserve me if they can‚Äôt love me for who I am.

"Just a heads up to avoid the ""Popular"" tab on mobile","tl;dr Random Transphobia appears on popular via r/ unpopularopinion

I haven't seen anyone else mention this before, so sorry if this is a known thing and I'm just creating spam unintentionally.

As a warning this post will be discussing transphobia, if you'd rather not see that then stop here. Please look after yourself üíô.

If, like me, you spend any amount of time on the popular tab I'd start avoiding it if I were you. The subreddit r/ unpopularopinion has been growing in popularity and as a result the ""unpopular opinions"" are regularly ending up in the popular tab. 

This wouldn't be a problem were it not that recently some... less sensitive... posts have been making it to the popular tab via r/ unpopularopinion, the most recent one being outright transphobic, specifically claiming that transwomen aren't women and are, instead, just suffering from ""cognitive delusion"" (and a few other fun comments). I am not going to link to the post.

I happened to be idly browsing popular while making a cup of tea when that thread of joy popped up out of nowhere and, speaking as a transwoman, I feel absolutely awful about myself right now. Since unpopular opinion is still going strong I'm personally going to be avoiding popular for now, but weather you do or not is entirely up to you.",lgbt

My message to this community. (Please hear me out),"Quick background: I am a straight, 36 yo Christian male. Ok, whatever, good, that is over with.

Today I was out on a run and my mind began to wonder (as it normally does). I was thinking about this small event in the Bible where a woman is publicly accused of adultery and she is about to be stoned. Then Jesus says (I am paraphrasing) The person that has never sinned may throw the first stone. Long-story-short, no one harms that lady.

I hope you are still with me.

I related this to the awful actions and verbal abuse that some/maybe even most Christians commit when talking at or about your LGBT community/lifestyle. How can they condemn you, when they are indeed sinful as well? I hope that last sentence wasn't taken out of context, too much, I am referring back to the event I with Jesus and the lady. No one on this planet is perfect. It amazes me that, to them, you are going to hell because of your ways, when the Bible says (again paraphrase) that even hating another person is equal to murder, because you have murdered them in your own heart. 

Look, this entire daydream played out while I was on a long run. And, I honestly felt the need to share it here. I just wish that I could have done a better job at explaining it. I have never been to this sub before, nor do I really pay attention to other people, in general. But I felt some need to type this.

So what?; Regardless of who you are, who you like, what you do (as long as you do not harm) I believe that you will all prosper one way or another. And I do hope that you still take time to follow faith, whatever faith that may be (I prefer Jesus. His teachings were awesome). I don't know you, but I respect you (everyone). I wish I could go on, but I think that is it. Best of luck and love to all of you. ",lgbt

A friend of mine that I'd known since kindergarten, who I'd always seen as family to me, going as far as practically being a sibling to. Him and his girlfriend where that exception, that I didn't ever want to lose. But they had started the distancing along with most of my other friends... And although I had written it off as them being busy with life, I didn't have myself entirely convinced. What generally bothered me the most about my friends distancing themselves from me, where the fact that most of them knew that I were trans wayyy before I even came out publicly, let alone started physically and socially transitioning. Yet, they hadn't started distancing themselves from me, until I were actively proceeding to chase my dream, and to live my authentic life.

Well, I guess this leads me to tonight..

Tonight when I opened Snapchat to add a girl I'd recently matched with on Tinder, I realized that his girlfriend's story had recently been updated tonight. And low and behold... They were currently throwing a Halloween themed housewarming party in their new apartment, which I'd yet to even see. And it was of course for all of the usual suspects that would be at their very frequent parties, which I'd always been invited to religiously. And as I saw this, something clicked in my mind. They hadn't been able to throw any parties over the last 6 months. Always some excuse when I asked about why, but now here they were throwing a party, that I hadn't been invited to or even heard mentions off, in our very brief and to the conversation ending point, conversations of the past months. If they threw this party, who's to say they haven't thrown others?

It was heartbreaking for me to realize, that I'd probably have to admit defeat... Not only had I lost most of my friends, but I'd also lost the two only people I saw as family, outside of my blood relatives.. And yeah, some of you may say it's coincidental at best. And you're not entirely wrong. But at some point, too many coincidences start stacking up, for it to *actually* be a coincidence.

I doubt this post will get much traction, which doesn't really matter. It was more a way for me to get my feelings and thoughts out, and send them into an ever expanding void, than it was me seeking compassion and empathy. It was just me doing that, in hopes of stopping myself from continuing to cry, which I've now done for an hour and a half straight... At some points I think there's no more tears left to cry, and then my body starts over again... I feel more isolated and alone than I've ever done before... I guess I'll end this here... I'm feeling so numb at this point, that I don't even see the point in continuing writing... ",lgbt
Looking for advice... parents iffy on my relationship,"I‚Äôm a woman (22F) with a girlfriend my age. We‚Äôve been on and off for about 2.5 years (on for around 2.25), but I‚Äôve been having issues with my parents taking this relationship seriously, I think.

I will be honest, when I initially told them I was bisexual and in a relationship with a girl, they did not react well and though they warmed up as time passed and they educated themselves more, they still seemed to avoid bringing her up. 

Meanwhile, during the months preceding their first meeting with her, my girlfriend was going through tough times at home with her narcissistic and abusive stepdad, so that served as a big emotional drain for her and a big source of anxiety for me.

During the following semester in college, I struggled with anxiety and was wearing my girlfriend‚Äôs emotional energy thin... she would repeatedly tell me she needed space because I was so anxious I couldn‚Äôt function well, and she was so used to a calm environment between us...this is when my parents were able to meet her, so maybe they didn‚Äôt start off on the best foot but we were at least on good terms at that point.

Eventually, she broke up with me in stages and I showed my parents my sadness on that matter, as well as told them she was with a new guy a week after we broke up... she seemed to still love me but think we were unhealthy so this hurt me, even though I thought she might have just gotten with him for comfort (this turned out to be true).

Months passed into my final year at college, she confessed she still loved me and I said the same, dude broke up with her, we slowly get back into relationship level to ensure we‚Äôre both good. My parents didn‚Äôt get this when I told them we were back together, so I had to reassure them all was good, and it‚Äôs been good ever since.

That summer, I asked my parents if I could bring her home with me when visiting them... they refused and I got upset, because she had been there before and I wanted them to get more comfortable with her again, so I stayed at my friends‚Äô house for a while, which infuriated my parents.

Fast forward to post-graduation... I had a research job at my university and stayed there for the summer while looking for a position once that ended. I lived with my gf because she was close to my university, and became more comfortable there, as I still felt that whenever I went home, the subject of my gf was barely addressed and left me with a sense of discomfort. Of course, my parents became upset with how much time I was spending with her versus them once the research job ended and I became dedicated to job search. I am afraid to tell them how we miss each other when I‚Äôm away because I know how much time we spend together, and I feel my parents still hope this relationship is a passing phase.

It seems that any time I leave or stay with her to help her out, they also find that ridiculous and tell me how much they need and want me home. I know my relationship with my gf may have been unhealthy in the past, but I feel that I have proven to my parents that it‚Äôs fine now and that it makes me happy.

This makes me sad, because I feel that all of the anger towards me visiting her is tearing my relationship apart... I do make a concerted effort to visit them, I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable living with them anymore. I really don‚Äôt know what to do, for whenever I bring up my gf and what she is going through, they seem to change the subject, not say much, or be unsympathetic. Further, if I change plans on them and visit her or do something with her, they say they think she‚Äôs using me, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs false.

Please help if you can power through all this text, I‚Äôm really at a loss for what to do. 

Note: I am also an only child, if that makes a difference ",lgbt
Just got refused service for being LGBT,"I went to Target to buy some syringes for my HRT. I asked a young lady at the desk for a few 23g 1"" needles and she went to the back to get them. She came back with an older lady who told me it was illegal to sell me any syringes. I know it's not, but I asked her if she's sure that it's illegal in our state. She said yes. I asked if I could talk to the manager, she told me she was the manager and I needed to leave. I'm pretty sure she wasn't the manager either, she was the pharmacist, but I just left like a coward. I wasn't going to be ""that tranny"" making a scene, and at the end of the day she can just claim she's Christian and do whatever she wants to LGBT people. Don't feel bad for me, feel bad for the trans, NB and even diabetic people in a town with only one pharmacy. They can't get their medication at all. Vote I guess. Idk it seems kind of hopeless right now.


Update: I've been trying to email Target and CVS, but they haven't responded yet. I've got no intrest in suing, mainly because I think this probably isn't illegal in my state, but also because I don't want any money or anything. I'm very grateful to all of your supportive comments. I was extremely depressed because nothing this bad had ever happened to me before, but knowing I have a community who feels sympathy for me has given me the closure no big company ever would.

I have a crush on a lesbian woman and I‚Äôm a bisexual woman but there‚Äôs one problem...,"I‚Äôm bisexual...except no one knows. I‚Äôm not out yet and I‚Äôve only dated men but I‚Äòve hooked up with women. I grew up in a community where not everyone was accepting so it‚Äôs taken me a while to accept it. But I just haven‚Äôt had the courage to tell my friends and family yet. 

Last night I went to a friends bday party and I met a woman who I later found out was lesbian (she mentioned it to me). This would‚Äôve been the perfect time to tell her I‚Äôm bisexual but that would mean everyone else would hear and like I said I‚Äôm not out yet. Then later she told me she liked my hair and kept talking to me a lot throughout the night and before I left she told me she liked my jacket. This made me like her even more. 

She‚Äôs so beautiful, kind and funny and I have a pretty big crush on her but I didn‚Äôt get her number. The bday girl is our mutual friend so I could ask the bday girl if she‚Äôs single. But...the bday girl thinks I‚Äôm straight. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm nervous to come out. Most of my current friends will accept me. But my family won‚Äôt. Also I‚Äôm not even sure if this woman likes me but I really like her. But I‚Äôve also never dated a woman so I‚Äôm nervous about that too. 

TLDR: I have a crush on a woman who‚Äôs friends with my friends...but none of my friends or family know I‚Äôm bisexual and I‚Äôve never dated a woman yet. What do I do?",lgbt

Interested to hear your thoughts about the choice of words when coming out.,"Hello! So, I‚Äôve been thinking lately about coming out as gay to my mom and I feel the need to decide on what I‚Äôm going to say to her. I feel like I want her to understand that this isn‚Äôt something up for debate or something that we‚Äôre going to fight about - it‚Äôs either you come to accept it or you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm almost 22 and I haven‚Äôt been living with her since graduating from high school, so it‚Äôs a little easier if it turns real bad. But it still feels a little... I don‚Äôt know, passive-aggressive? To say it like that. 

So, I would be interested to hear about what you think is the right way to go about it or what‚Äôs your experience. I feel like overall the word choice is not going to be that important, but it can still influence the reaction to some degree.",lgbt
Gay and disabled issues.,"I am a male, 19 and am in college. I am deaf and have a disease call Charcot Marie Tooth Disease. I just need to rant and pour my emotions out. This night is one of the worst nights of my life. I went on a date and the guy was intimidated by my disabilities even though I always have a disclaimer about it. Then a guy on tinder told me I'm not worth it to date. I met very few sweet guys and when I do, they tell me I'm not their type or they're too scared to date me. One just a few minutes ago told me he was on his way and then he was like I'm not sure anymore. Why is there LGBT community so unfriendly to the disabled.

Documentary about Indian trans community,"Hi everyone, I recently became a part of a team working to make a documentary spotlighting the stories and activism of the world's oldest ethnic transgender community in India, the Hijra people. Their stories are so important and we're really excited at having this chance to help spotlight them. It focuses on the amazing work being done by activist Rudrani Chettri and her work for better representation for her and those that identify as 'Hijra' in India. 

We're gearing up to raise support for the film and just went live with our social media channels. I was hoping some of you might be interested in finding out more about it and would give us a like on Facebook and follow on twitter!

A few weeks later I was crossdress ing an chilling with my friends and one of my other friends who doesn't know I crossdress starts talking about stuff with me. He starts talking about him finding a friend of his attractive. This guy mentions by bf's name and bells start ringing in my head.

I'm a trans man in the closet and my male friend said he has feelings for me,"Hey!

Soo I have never heard of anyone talking about this... I wanted to know if someone has gone through something similar... 

I am a trans man but no one else knows about it. I'm in the closet and present myself as female, and I kind of have this ""delicate"", shy, way of expressing myself. I have always felt atracted to girls, and never felt attraction for men. Some time ago, my male friend, who is straight, told me he has feelings for me. He is kind of a shy guy too, not the manly type.

It's confusing for me. I don't know what to think about this. It's so strange, because we are both man and both straight, but he likes me. This makes me even more scared of coming out. But I also felt nice to know that someone likes me. It made me wonder if I am gay, or if he is gay and doesn't know. I just really can't picture myself with a guy now. Actually not anyone who sees me as a girl. We continue to be friends, I have been ignoring what he said. He asked me if i felt something for him and I said no. He asked me if I had ever felt anything for a man, and I said no. So he thinks I'm a lesbian,and I'm like, I cannot feel anything for you... 

I just wish he could see me as myself. It annoys me to think he is atracted to things on myself that I hate, that I'm not comfortable with, that doesn't reflect me.

Thanks guys!

What do you mean you don't approve???,"I'm a straight 21 year old dude. And my coworker is something else. Yesterday he was going on a rant about gay people he saw in a restaurant. His complaint?

He literally gags at homosexuality. And his grandma is a lesbian! But ""I still don't approve of that"" he says. I then say to him, ""Wait a second, you go know they're born that way right? Like, it isn't a choice.

this guy right here (rant),"ok so i‚Äôm sure everyone knows onision or how ever u spell it. this guy is an asshole. we all know. but [this video](https://youtu.be/l7zEhZ4zaWQ) is a bit much. this is a cis gender, straight man coming on to youtube thinking he can just, ya know, say that trans ppl getting gender conforming surgeries are mutilating themselves. his points in the video include, 
1. trans ppl hating themselves is transphobic 
    
a. he explains that when a trans person says they hate themselves they are putting themselves underneath cis ppl so that‚Äôs transphobic
    
b. he says in the video ‚Äúif i woke up in a woman‚Äôs body, i would love it‚Äù thus proving his point /s

2. mutilation. 
    
a. for some reason this poor man can‚Äôt understand that for a lot of trans ppl, it would be life threatening if they didn‚Äôt get certain surgeries. 
   
b. he terribly misuses the word. a lot. 

3. no h8 plz
    
a. he says at the end of the video that if you comment anything that doesn‚Äôt align with his beliefs then he‚Äôll send his twelve year old fans after you so don‚Äôt. 
   
b. i posted a comment explaining what he got wrong in the video and it was promptly deleted so rip i guess.

Navigating my first f/f dating experience,"Hey all. So since mid-September or so I've been talking to a girl who I met online. Due to our current life happenings meeting up isn't always easy, but every time we do it goes fantastic (and so far it's been much easier for me than dating men... but that's a whole other can of worms!) Anyway, she's not that great at texting sometimes... as in, replies are pretty slow, but in person we can talk for literal hours and never run out of things to say. I just don't want to not talk/see each other for too long, and it falters...

I want to invite her to my place since we've been talking about a movie night for a really long time. We're hanging out this Saturday with some of her friends as well, but I kind of want something private too since everything we've done has been in public settings and being not-straight it's awfully harder to show affection... but I don't want to give the impression it's uhh ""netflix and chill"" because neither of us are quite comfortable with that yet...

I need some advice -
1) Should I be worried about the slow texting? She is often busy and we do use a separate app for texts I don't think she uses otherwise because it's the only one I use.
2) Would inviting her over be a bad idea? I don't want to seem like a creep.

I just don't know what's ""normal"" for f/f. All the guys I've been with took it too fast and I was never comfortable. But this time I actually want it and wish we could be together more??? But I know other friends who took it slower at first / their SOs suck at texts and ended up long term and very happy, so idk if I should worry.

You got to the end! Thanks for trying to make sense of my rambling. :)",lgbt

Does she like me? (Bisexual),"This maybe a bit long. Female here. So basically when I was 16 I liked this girl and we knew each other and everything and talked everytime we saw each other from 15 to 16. I fancied her at one point and had guts and said to her face that ""I like you Claire (anon name)"". Then Claire didn't respond and just walked away and ignored me. After a couple of months went by we where talking generally again and I just had a mild crush back then anyways.

Skipping to when I was 19 we started messaging here and there just short messages over phone about life and what not. She said she wanted to meet up and I had no money at the time so lost contact

Skipping to now she has rang me a couple of times and I picked the phone up today she was really happy over the phone was giggling a lot (sounded kind of nervous) as previously she hasn't been nervous around me in person not much anyways nor over the phone. So she was saying ""how are you"" and saying she wanted to meet up but I was spending time with my partner (male).

She responded with ""you are always busy"" which I am its a busy term so far due to studying then she we where talking about our families briefly then out the blue she said ""I remember the time you fancied me"" and I was getting nervous cause I said I didn't want to be reminded of that and was laughing a bit. Then she came out with ""I went out with a girl and we went to New York"" so she now identifies herself as Bisexual I was shocked and said ""wow awesome"" then she was giggling and asked ""we really need to meet and she said she really wanted to meet me today I said I am free at xyz"" and claire responded ""okay cool we will sort the time nearer the time""

 then she said ""how's things with your partner is he still being a bit of a twit?"" I responded with no we have been together for 3 yrs and she responded with ""3 yrs doesnt mean anything tho and she asked 2 times if I am in love with him I said I love him and that he is right next to me so its awkward"" then she said ""oh shit sorry"" then I said goodbye because I was going into a restaurant.

The reason why I am asking this and that I think she likes me is another person who is a guy he likes me and said and asked me things similar about my partner to me.

"Anyoen else (sep. Bi, Pan, etc) have any funny ""wait... I'm not straight"" moments?","I ask because I was thinking about my whole story of realizing I liked guys, too, and realized it was pretty funny looking back. I figure there's got to be a goldmine sitting around in here and I could use a laugh today.

My personal story:

&amp;#x200B;

So I was this pretty ""normal"" if kinda quiet kid back in 8th grade. (still mostly am, I'm not shy I just only speak when I have something to say) For my algebra class I had this amazingly attractive guy sit in front of me. every. single. day.

Now, I'm bi, so up until this point I never gave it a passing thought that I might be into guys. Was DEFINITELY into  girls so I always just assumed that my weirdness in the locker room was just typical and no one talked about it really.

So I saw this guy, and for some odd reason couldn't get my mind off him during class. (my worst year of math grades) I was being frustrated by this, trying to figure out why I was so obsessed until I came to this conclusion:

I kid you not, this is pretty much verbatim what I thought: ""He's just super hot. If I was gay, I'd totally be obsessed with this guy. No wonder I can't stop thinking about him""

LMAO

This went on for half a year before I finally realized:

""Wait... if I think this guy is super hot and i'm obsessed with him... I might be gay""

\*panics until I get home, frantically googles ""can you be a little gay"" because I somehow didn't know the word ""Bisexual""\*

Three years later I've gone through the whole ""is lgbt but raised Christian"" thing, found a wonderful GSA at my high school, (I miss those guys, had to leave for early+free college classes, but I get to see them at local pride prom!) and generally life is looking up.

"I really, really need some advice.","I know that this is a sub-reddit full of people who have accepted or trying to accept who they are, but I'm hoping someone can relate or know some advice so I'm going here anyway.

 I realized the other day why I'm so awkward in so many social situations,  whether it's with guys or girls that I don't know extremely well - after my girlfriend jokingly said that I might be pan-romantic (she's also LGBT btw), I kept dwelling on it and I realized that she was right - and I absolutely hate the discovery. I'm completely heterosexual, yet I have the capacity to feel romantic attraction towards everyone. I feel very uncomfortable with the mere thought of being in a relationship with someone who isn't female, so It's doing nothing more to me except making my life difficult and stressing me tf out. It's a weight.

Since I doubt this is something I can ""fix"", can someone give me some advice on how I can cope with this - if it's even possible? I don't know what to do and I'm freaking the hell out. 

(And for the love of God please don't harass me, I really can't handle that right now. I'm so far on the edge of my seat I don't know if this post makes any sense at all ;-;)",lgbt

Discourse Advice to an Old Gay tm,"I was at a bar while traveling and got into a conversation with an older gay man. We talked about culture differences and the AIDS crisis, etc... Once I mentioned I am trans, shit kinda hit the wall. 

In the same breath of him saying that he supports the trans community he said that I‚Äôd never be a gay man because I don‚Äôt have a penis, and that gay men aren‚Äôt interested in vaginas.


I tried explaining that sexuality, sex, and gender are different concepts- he gets that. 

That some gay men are in relationships with trans men- he doesn‚Äôt understand. 

It was incredibly frustrating, but I stayed cordial. He‚Äôs curious, but dense. 

Note: when talking about sex and stuff, he really put an emphasis on penis size and that the insult of having a tiny dick is a huge offense. He wouldn‚Äôt be interested in a dude with a less than average member, let alone a ‚Äútranny‚Äù (Personally, I revel in that. Usually the first person to make a small dick joke).

What arguments or examples would you have used in order to sway his opinion? 

I‚Äôm not looking for ‚Äúfuck that guy and just leave‚Äù answers. I really wanna be able to have discourse to sway others and not be aggressive about it either. 

Prejudice and discrimination is born from ignorance. It helps no one if you choose to let them linger in the dark. 

I just wanna be ready the next time something like that happens.

I'm bi but I want to be gay?,"I'll start by saying I think I'm homoromantic pansexual.  I realized and was pretty sure I was gay about a year and a half ago, but I've also been somewhat attracted to girls as well so it caused a lot of internal conflict.  I've never been in a relationship since middle school (which doesn't really count tbh), so all of this is pretty much in my head which only adds to the confusion.  Bi/pansexuality is valid and I know that's a possibility but internalized biphobia makes me think maybe I'm not actually gay since I still kinda like girls and I'm making it up.  In the end, sexuality is fluid and what I am really doesn't matter and I'll figure it out once I get to it.  Until then it's all just in my head.

Lgbt cafe,"There are studies shows that people of the lgbt community are more likely to misuse substances than heterosexuals. Lgb teens were found 90% more are reported to use substances.

Gay or lgbt bars are usually (at least back then) the spot to meet other queer people. It‚Äôs a social environment where people could enjoy entertainment and meet like minded people. The only problem is the large amount of drug consumption and its influences on younger queer people. 

A great investment would be in lgbt cafes. Not only it‚Äôs alcohol free, people of all ages could come in and meet like minded people. Queer identifying teens will have one less influence into doing drugs. Also it creates a sense of community, teens will have a belonging in a community that‚Äôs a safe space for them. There‚Äôs a correlation between a sense of belonging in the community and doing well in school (and even life). Entertainment wise, we could have (but not limited to) lgbt artist, performers and acts come in. Support the locals while we are at it. 

In theory this sounds pretty cool, but it takes more decision making and planning to this. This is just a mere brainstorm for now. I find that our adolescents are very important to the communities of all parts of the world. We do need more spaces where lgbt people can bond that doesn‚Äôt revolves around alcohol.

Tired of hiding but don't know what to do.,"Background: I'm 21 years old, bisexual, and definitely at least non-binary.

&amp;#x200B;

I first realized I was bi when I was 15 and earlier this year realized I was non-binary. I've been living as a queer person for over six years and have been hiding it from my family ever since then. During that time, I've been interrogated about my sexuality by my dad and sat silently as my family rattled off countless slightly homophobic and transphobic remarks about other people. They are somewhat *tolerant* at best otherwise and *do* have ""gay friends,"" some of whom even went as far as to invite them to the local Pride parade one year. My parents extended the invitation to me. I declined on the instinct that it was nothing more than a trap.

&amp;#x200B;

The past few months in particular have been amazing for me. As of two months ago today I'm dating an amazing fellow enby who makes me feel happier and more comfortable than anyone ever before. I've started going to a trans student group in college that has also been greatly helping me realize my gender. I feel so much better about myself now that I don't have to pretend to be something I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

I was working on a writing assignment today and I realized just how sick I am of having to switch identities between college/online and family life. I really feel like I'm ready to come out and fully express who I am, but I'm just afraid of how my family will react. They're tolerant of homosexuality to a mixed degree, still confused at best about transgender people, and don't even know that non-binary people are an actual, valid thing. Plus, these are the people who pay for my car insurance, gasoline, and college tuition, not to mention let me live in their house and eat their food. I don't have enough time or experience to fit a job in my schedule, let alone one that pays well enough for me to survive on my own.

My little brother told me something that really helped me out.,"Most people- specifically most cishet folks- are told what they are and they just roll with it. And that‚Äôs valid. If that‚Äôs how you do, that‚Äôs how you do. 

But queer folks? We figured out who we were for ourselves. We questioned what we were told about ourselves, and found that we were not what we were told. We discovered something in ourselves noone had thought to consider would be there. 

There‚Äôs something unbelievably beautiful about that. 

There is something resplendent about being queer. We are miraculous and incredible, because we break expectations just by existing and being happy.

So the next time you feel insecure about your identity? Remember. You are so different from what the world expected of you. And that makes your experiences all the more beautiful. ",lgbt

How can I be a better supporter of my friends?,"This is probably going to be the cliche hetero-cis-white-male scenario, and as such I know I‚Äôm more often than not the last guy most people want to hear sociopolitical opinions from, but I genuinely would like some advice.

A fair number of people in my life have come out as either non-binary or pan/bi/gay/other and have expressed their preferences for pronouns and such. I care about them and want to do my best to support them as best I can. The biggest ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is adjusting from he/she to the neutral ‚Äúthey‚Äù or using their name. Not difficult, just takes some adjusting.

I am completely in support of people living their lives and identifying themselves as they feel comfortable. That‚Äôs how you feel, that‚Äôs how you identify, I will do my best to respect and acknowledge that.

However, here‚Äôs where my questioning comes in. Some of my friends have identified as pan, bi, and gay, and sometimes a combination thereof, or sometimes just ‚Äúqueer‚Äù.  I just don‚Äôt know enough about the terminology and identification to know how best to understand their situations. In my mind, again due to lack of experience and understanding, I would have thought one would be generally one of the above rather than multiple. To me that seems a bit contradictory, but that‚Äôs just due to my lack of knowledge.

As dumb as this may sound, I am genuinely curious if there‚Äôs like a terminology primer or ‚Äúcliffs notes‚Äù I could consult? Growing up in a relatively conservative household, the first openly gay person I met outside of my family (my mom‚Äôs brother was gay, one of dad‚Äôs best friends is gay, and one of mom‚Äôs best friends is lesbian) was my freshman year roommate.

Finding My Orientation,"I've never really written about this except for quick blunt explanations to my Discord friends, so I guess here we go.

*Releasing a quick internal scream.*

Aight NOW HERE WE GO.

I suppose I'll start with a simple introduction. My name's Garrett. I'm currently 20 years old living outside of Cleveland, OH. I've always been sexually attracted to women, and only women, and that's still the case today... but Chris Pratt on the other hand. At first I thought it was *normal* for even a straight white male to say ""Dude, Chris Pratt, actually kinda hot"". Unfortunately, a lot of my cousins I was hanging out with around this time asked if I was gay, and I simply said no. I don't *like* men, not like that.
Weeks later, I was getting my daily dosage of Thomas Sanders (as any good ol' queer does), and it struck me subconsciously: Thomas is actually kind of hot. Wait, Chris Pratt is Hot, Thomas is hot... am I gay? No, no, they're just attractive is all, that's normal. I'm straight, I like women...
But Joan looks kinda hot too- WAIT JOAN ISN'T EVEN BIANARY.
And then, after a glorious day of reading up on different sexualities, because the idea of me being attracted to men, women, and NB seemed absolutely abstract, I found something interesting. It wasn't sexuality, but *romanticism*. As soon as I found out Panromantic was a thing, it suddenly clicked. I told myself ""Y'know what? Yeah, dudes are hot, chicks are hot, in between is hot too. Would I sleep with a dude or an NB? Nah probably not, but I have no problem holding hands and cuddling and shit. That just sounds like a nice time.""
Granted, explaining being panromantic and heterosexual is still difficult with those I'm open to, because it feels like I'm explaining something really different from someone saying they're gay, lesbian, etc. Nevertheless, many of my friends have been cool with it, and *my closest friends and I all came out to each other at the same time*, so that was fun as hell.

Question on coming out,"Hey everyone!

So I was planning to come out on Bisexual Awareness Day, but wanted to check with my partner first because I was talking about them. Then National Coming Out Day hit me and I was feeling depressed and unable to deal.

Am I crazy or is there an increase in the usage of homophobic slurs in posts on the top page?,"It‚Äôs ridiculous that I even feel the need to get this off my chest, but over the past few days I have seen multiple posts on the front page containing the words ‚Äúsoyboy,‚Äù ‚Äúf*ggot,‚Äù and ‚Äúgay lord‚Äù employed in a hateful manner. Why is this hate speech tolerated by mods?  

Use of the ‚Äúhard R‚Äù in racial epithets seems to be unacceptable, as it should be. So why are homophobic slurs seen as par for the course?  Why do people upvote these posts that contain such hurtful words? When I confront whoever employs these words, I‚Äôm downvoted like crazy. I would understand this if I were on some super conservative, hateful sub, but this is popping up everywhere. 

I‚Äôm so sick and tired of being told to ‚Äúget a sense of humor‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn what sarcasm means.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not ignorant of real world issues, and I personally encounter these words on a weekly basis in real life, but this has not always been such an evident problem to me on popular Reddit subs. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure where else to post this, and I questioned even vocalizing it, because I don‚Äôt like to admit to being bothered by idiots using hateful words. I‚Äôm really just dumbfounded that mods would tolerate it. ",lgbt

Would you say that this is homophobic harassment?,"I've just been wasting some time on Omegle, and came across a catfish supposedly trying to catch out predators.

can you be transgender without believing in gender binaries?,"first of all, i assure you this is an honest question. not trying to stir up any drama. idk if anybody cares or not but im a cis white hetero male, just trying to learn lol.

anyway, this question was inspired by this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/9p9llc/a_boy_who_doesnt_believe_in_gender_and_being_gay/

and it got me thinking, if a person is transgender does that also (typically?) mean they believe in gender binaries? from my understanding it seems like you must, because you transitioned from one defined thing to another distinct thing. if a person didnt accept gender binaries wouldnt they be more likely to just identify as ""X""  rather than as trans?

Funny story: Being misinterpreted as transphobic,"Me and a couple friends were talking today about how I used to be a part of the Mormon church. I no longer am. I was joking around and said ""Mormonism is a cult!"" when one of my friends(a trans woman) went silent. She slowly replied ""No, it's not."" I thought maybe she didn't understand  it was joke(but she's not dense, I was fairly sure she understood), so I thought maybe she didn't know what it was like to grow up in a Mormon household, so I said ""Well you never knew what it was like to be Mormon, and you never will."" 

She was shocked, almost offended. I then proceeded to ask her if she was Mormon, which I was 95% sure she wasn't. More silence. I repeated myself, because maybe she didn't hear me. ""Mormonism. Mormonism is a cult!"" She tilted her head and said ""Did you say... Mormonism?"" 

""Yeah."" 

""Oh. I thought you said womanism."" Womanism is a cult. You never knew what is was like to be a woman, and you never will. Are you a woman?

Been homeless for a little over two months due to parents kicking me out after I came out as lesbian.,"Some backstory: I come from a pretty conservative Christian family, and at a young age started feeling romantically for girls, but realized that no other girls were having those feelings and always talked about their crushes on girls. This led to me feeling alienated in middle school due to all the boy talk in my friend group and the constant questions about which boy Im crushing on etc etc. 


In high school I entered a new friend group full of really great people that I eventually came out to. They comforted me and were really amazing and supportive. Needless to say, this amazing support had sort of put the idea into my head that coming out to my parents wouldn‚Äôt be such a bad thing, you know, it‚Äôs 2018 right? I‚Äôd never really heard my parents trash on LGBTQ before so I assumed the worst that could happen is they‚Äôd assume it was a phase and kind of just brush it off and just pretend like it never happened. 


If you‚Äôve read the title, you probably know that I was very wrong. I sat my parents down and told them and they were LIVID. My father yelled at me and told me that if I wanted to be a ‚Äúdyke‚Äù then I had to go be a ‚Äúdyke‚Äù somewhere else, my father started smashing things and I ran upstairs to my room to cry. I heard my dad yelling and heard something that really hit me hard, it was something along the lines of ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not my daughter etc etc.‚Äù I come from a very traditional Asian family and hadn‚Äôt realized that in traditional Asian culture, homophobia is frowned upon greatly. 

Thanks to my amazing friend group I had places to stay for the first few weeks, but eventually my luck ran out. I‚Äôm not sure what to do now and it‚Äôs been a struggle trying to eat daily and find somewhere to sleep. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve had to miss school because I couldn‚Äôt find a place to shower etc. 

My parents won‚Äôt talk to me and I don‚Äôt have any other family in the city, my bank account has dropped to 0 as I‚Äôve used my savings to buy food and other necessities. 

I apologize for the super long post but I had to get this off my chest 

TL;DR: Parents kicked me out for being a lesbian, feel like my life is ruined, don‚Äôt know what to do. ",lgbt
How do I let people know I‚Äôm queer without explicitly telling everyone ?,"Hello everyone ! I am an 18 yr old male, who has recently integrated into a new school just last year and have had trouble finding friends apart of an LGBTQ community. The school I go to isn‚Äôt particularly accepting of people that identify with this community and I don‚Äôt really want everyone to know that I‚Äôm apart of it in fear of being bullied, etc. I do however want to be in a relationship with someone that would like to be in a gay relationship. So here‚Äôs my problem, how do I let people know I am willing to be apart of a gay relationship without my entire school knowing?

Unfortunately there is no LGBTQ club at my school and I just do not have the time outside of school and work to join a club. My uncle works with an AIDS foundation which hosts social events for LGBTQ teens but he lives a fair drive away and i unfortunately cannot drive out everyday time they have an event. I also don‚Äôt have any friends because I joined the school year late, but am apart of a small group, who I really enjoy spending time with. I know everything I listed above really restricts my possibilities to meet new people but I‚Äôm just too busy/embarrassed to put myself out there and search for this relationship. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this post is kinda confusing, I was just hoping that maybe someone has experienced something similar. Any of your personal experiences would be greatly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read my post ! ",lgbt
Came out in person for the first time!,"So I've been """"""""""""out"""""""""""" as Bi for about 4-5 months, but only on my private social media account, so like 2-3 dozen or so people know (The most random people too, so congrats Mary, even though I haven't spoken to you in like 2 years, since you follow me you get to know before many closer friends). Even then, I always had a real problem coming out to new people, but I recently transferred schools so I thought ""Hey, why not start fresh?"".

   

Today I spaced out on my phone while hanging out with my friends (Only one of which knew) and when I came back a couple seconds later, they were talking about how to stand in a certain way, and when I asked about what they were doing, one replied ""Trying to stand like a gay guy"" (Sidebar, the friend who responded is very much ""I sexually identify as a mailbox"" but he's my friends roommate so he is usually with us)

 

I respond ""Oh sweet so I'm already halfway there cuz I'm Bi"" which is a huge step from ""Actively Ignoring commenting on my sexuality"", so you know, progress!

Drugs for a homosexual to enhance performance and excite from an intercourse with a woman,"I'm most probably a homosexual who feels uncomfortable in his own skin, mostly because romantically I attach myself exclusively to women. It's only natural for a woman to want to have an intercourse with his man, and that's where I would underperform. Notice the ""would"" part, as I have never had an intercourse in my life. WRT porn, I'm never fully excited with heterosexual porn, my erection is strong but is unstable, meaning I can go soft at any moment. I probably could name only a handful of female pornstars who get me going at a reasonable level. My position as a homosexual heteroromantic is very difficult and futile, that's why I need some coping mechanisms, and meds are just a way to do that. I'm inexperienced in this aspect, so I ask you, forum, to help me on this journey.

Please don't post with ""You should accept yourself for who you are"", as I'm honestly fed up with this.",lgbt

How to tell if your bi or gay,"18 M. Some back story. So I had sex for the first with my girl 2 months ago and I was nervous as fuck and couldn‚Äôt get up and she said it was fine and it‚Äôs normal.

When I‚Äôm alone my mind goes fucking insane and I analyze everyone and everything. It‚Äôs a different side of my brain asking me these questions about what I like or dislike or what I find attractive or not attractive. Are you bi ? Are you gay ? Are you straight ?. When I was younger around 8-9 my brother and my cousin would fool around sexually and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs normal.  Like touching each others dicks and making him put on a bra.  Idk my mind would go back to that and question it. When I‚Äôm hanging with my guy friends I don‚Äôt think about making moves or anything that isn‚Äôt even on my mind. When I‚Äôm around girls I can‚Äôt stop looking at them. I don‚Äôt have a good support system right now either cuz all of my friends are gone and I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk too. Idk if I‚Äôm lacking a sense of belonging and love or just questioning my sexuality. I fantasize about girls at night, but when thoughts about dudes appear I can‚Äôt fantasize no more I get completely turned off and ask myself why did I think about that.  Saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Straight‚Äù is mad comfortable with me but saying I‚Äôm gay or bi just doesn‚Äôt fit right with me. I‚Äôm usually a really touchy person too cuz it‚Äôs how I express myself and love. Idk please. I‚Äôm going insane dawg. There‚Äôs more but this is a lot already ",lgbt
What's wrong with me? Am I asexual? I can't figure this out for the life of me and it's tearing me apart.,"I'm 22, trans female, and I can honestly say if I never have sex again I'd be fine with it. Does that make me ace in and of itself? I will have sex on occasion but it's purely to get my rocks off, nothing more, nothing less. I don't particularly enjoy having sex, other than the climax. 

Before sex if my fiancee is trying to initiate I almost always resist, not really wanting to have sex.

In the moment sex is nice and feels good and whatnot, but afterwards I just feel gross. I have to clean up immediately and still feel gross for awhile afterwards.

We're at a point where we only have sex once a month or less, but we've gone through phases of multiple times a day, and that doesn't sound very asexual to me? 

The *idea* of sex is pleasing to me, and I watch porn and masturbate on a regular basis, which also doesn't sound very asexual to me.

Maybe it's some weird form of dysphoria? IDK anymore and it's killing me. I want to be able to put a name and some concrete structure to my sexuality once and for all to be able to have some closure, especially as this is causing some tension in the relationship.

Please help, I need advice.

And please don't just say ""it won't work out, you're sexually incompatible"" because I plan on being with this woman for the rest of my life and something as superficial as sex isn't going to change that, not after what she and I have been through.

Thank you all in advance.

TL;DR -- Am I ace if I don't particularly enjoy sex but can still have and enjoy it sometimes? ",lgbt
My Trans Experience,"I started transitioning in Summer of 2012, did HRT for 3 months before becoming really sick and having to stop HRT. Since then, I've medically recovered but can't get a doc to put me back on HRT. 

Socially, I can't make friends and nobody wants to date me. As far as friendships are concerned, cis people are just flakey or just kind-of iffy about me. Trans friendships are almost impossible because I have no desire to be a raging, violent, authoritarian SJW and also would just like to not have ANYTHING to do with politics of ANY kind, period. 

Everyone either wants to treat me like I'm 

(A) Dangerous 

(B)  Their token trans friend so they can have ""good person points""

(C) Their dress-up doll

(D) A liability of some kind 

(E) Not allowed to have my own individualism, thoughts, etc.

So can teenage virgins be sex addicts?,"I am 17, and 60% of my thoughts are on men. I love the male anatomy, but I nvr had sex with anybody. I masturbate a lot, and sometimes I ask myself if having sex with a lot of men would be a fun part time job. I know this is crazy and unhealthy sexually but it's obsessive at this point, I can't stop thinking about men or boys my age I want to hop onto.

Is this just virgin frustrations, like how straight men get desperate and fuck the sane sex in jail? Or is this a big problem? Will my brain stop thinking about this if I actually had sex? Help LGBT adults...",lgbt

What am I? Am I asexual? lithsexual? straight? gay?," I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate post. English isn't my first language.

I'm a woman in my late 20s. I've struggled with dating and relationships and questioned my sexuality whole my life. I first thought I was straight who just gets no love, then maybe I'm gay, or maybe I'm bisexual, and now I'm thinking maybe I'm asexual. I took a quiz today, and it says I'm lithsexual. Is it even a thing?

I've never had sex in my life or in a relationship with anyone. I can't really say that I don't like sex or I don't want to have sex when I haven't had it, I actually don't know for sure if I don't want to have sex at all. Maybe I'm awfully afraid of it, or feel guilty about sex? Or I have very high standards? So I've tried to have sex with someone, hopefully with a boyfriend, for many years. I got more and more miserable the more I try.

Every time I meet someone interested in me, I automatically thought of the chances I would have sex with them, because I badly wanted to try to see if I really don't like it. I wouldn't want to have sex with most of them even though I think they are cute and cool. I just don't feel that. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and I can't just force myself to have sex, could I? This thought made me uncomfortable and I pushed them away. I felt extremely bad because I kept feeling like I can't give them what they want from me. Not just sex, the intimacy, the connection. Ideally, I want to be connected with them platonically first, but it's obvious they are attracted to me and I feel like I'm a bad person to take advantage of them. After telling them I might be asexual, I became friends with some of them, but I am still not very comfortable. I am still not attracted to them.

There were a few guys who I found extremely attractive and gave me butterflies. But I still don't think about ""sex"". I just get very excited and they are such cool people so I am romantically attracted to them. I wouldn't mind having sex with them if that's what they want. They are usually out of my league, though. I'm even thinking about paying a hooker to have sex with me, to take my virginity.

For some reason, I usually find kissing very gross. I like cuddling a lot, but not kiss. Only when I'm drunk I can kiss without being grossed out. But I'm not sure if that's because I haven't found the right people.

So, I got back to try being with girls again. Not with a lot of success, because where I'm from LGBT isn't as open as the western world and it's a lot harder to find lesbians. And honestly I wasn't that excited about this idea because I could see myself being romantically attracted to them and I've been attracted to women before, but I can't see me having sex with them. It's more of an idealization than actual attraction too, I think. I just want to look at them and appreciate their beauty. I just don't have a lot of fun when I'm dating a girl than I'm dating a guy period. It gets boring.

Thing is, I masturbate and watch porn regularly. Quite often, in fact. Like 3 times a week. I never think about someone and I only focus on my orgasm though. I don't like to look at vagina for some reason so I almost only watch kiss, cuddling, anal, oral, SM or other stuff. Sound and the pleasure of people is what turns me on, and pain, to be honest. But I do not want to be part of that. I just like to get pleasure from clitoral stimulation and that's it. I never think about wanting other people to give me pleasure. I am satisfied and I am happy. I can't be sure though, that if it's because I am afraid of having sex with someone of it's because I'm asexual.

But, I am really lonely because I don't think I have connection with anyone. I have friends, but it's different from a relationship. I want to be in a relationship. I want to be intimate with someone, not physically but emotionally.

I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if anyone will read this, but thanks a lot if you did.",lgbt

Legal Question for LGBT couple getting divorced,"(SERIOUS) One of my best friends (K) is a lesbian and legally married to her spouse (G). They are in the process of getting divorced now. They had a union ceremony 18 years ago and then legally got married 4 years ago. Her wife is the primary bread winner (very very wealthy bread winner) and my friend is the stay at home mom (SAHM). They both chose mediation instead of going to lawyers for the divorce.. However my friend K is getting bullied by G big time. G is financially doing things against the mediation agreement which is a breach of contract etc... and I think K is getting screwed out of a lot of spousal support. Their son is 6yo. Joint custody right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here in this community know of any legal divorce precedent that can have assets legally attached to the union ceremony they had 18 years ago instead of the legal wedding 4 years ago... Because currently K's spousal support is only based on 4 years of marriage but that's just not accurate and the law is bullshit against LGBTQ community.  I am straight and don't have a lot of LGBT friends to discuss this with (who might know info or have friends who would know) and thought you guys might know?

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is such a wonderful lady and her wife is manipulating heartless person (using the kid to get back at her-BS stuff like that). I just don't want K taken advantage of or to be destitute as a result of this. With the spousal support and proceeds from the sell of the house, she's in a place to receive high 6 figures to start a new life for her and her son (she's applying for full custody as she's the one that's raised him).

Guys I really like her and I can't believe it took me so long to ask her out!,"I first met her last fall when her roommate, a good friend of mine, invited me over to their place. She was in a bathrobe and about to take a shower and wash off a bunch of paint. Tis the life of an artist. I thought she was really cute and fun but was too shy and self-conscious to say anything so I left it at that. Plus, everyone thought she had a thing going on with someone else, and I didn't want to intrude. Not long after, I entered my first relationship and it was awful. He was disinterested, never wanted to do anything, and always made me feel extremely stressed out and confused. Friends commented that they felt as if they saw him more often than I did, which is probably very true. Turns out he wasn't actually interested and left me feeling extremely awkward for over two months rather than speaking up. After that, I was pretty dejected and my self-consciousness increased. Why would someone even do that? I never dated earlier in life because I wanted to avoid immature shit like lack of communication and look where it got me.

But one day I was walking home at night and ran into her. We talked for a long time and it turned out that she wasn't dating the person everyone thought she was. In fact, she wasn't even interested in this person and then began describing her type...which was suspiciously similar to me in appearance and personality. Of course, with me being dumb as rocks, I assume it is a coincidence. We started hanging out more often after that. I asked her out a few times, but always got cold feet and told her to invite friends. She continued to overload me with compliments I had no idea how to accept. When we weren't with each other in person, we were with each other through snapchat or texting. Finally, my best friend took notice of this and asked if I liked her romantically. I decided then and there that yes, I did, and yes, I would ask her out. This was much easier said than done. I took me weeks to work up the courage. Whenever we hung out in person we were surrounded by friends so I figured I'd text her, and this text sat unsent for two full days. Every single bad scenario ran through my mind. I didn't want to lose her presence in my life or make our mutual friends feel awkward. But not even before I put my phone back down, she responded with not only a yes but also multiple suggestions as to what we could do when we hung out.

So now we're dating and she makes me so. Damn. Happy. I cannot believe it took me a year to ask this girl out. She's cute, smart, funny, talented, and most importantly, she's kind. She's like the complete opposite of the guy I dated last year. She actually wants to be around me, and it threw me for a loop. I genuinely didn't know how to process the person I'm dating wanting to be around me as much as I want to be around them. People have told me that I look happier around her, and I really am. She spent the night at my place the other day and it was so nice to wake up with someone in my arms. She is the best distraction from the severe shittiness life has been throwing at me as of late. I spend a lot of time away from her thinking about her, and that's kind of why I'm writing this post. I've got to get this out so I can actually study for my exam tomorrow.

TL;DR: The girl I'm dating makes me so happy I can't even process it.",lgbt

The difficulties of being part of LGBT in Vietnam,"There are currently some major drawbacks being of being LGBT here.

1/ Same sex marriage are legal but the government do not and will never accept it as a legitimate marriage. Same sex couples will not receive supports from the government and the law in case of a divorce because it is still considered as a taboo by our government.

2/ There is no law against discrimination for civilians only for the government that means if you talk shits about the government, you're fucked. But if you spewed toxic shit to someone, you're not going to receive any notable punishment from the law. That means that while hate speech against LGBT is not an ethical thing to do, it isn't an illegal thing to do either

3/ Child abuse itself is already a problem, it's not uncommon for LGBT children who came out to their parents to only getting beaten up by their parents for violating their family traditions.

4/ The government could be an asshole sometimes: [Pham Le Quyen Tram, a Vietnamese transgender woman, loses government recognition](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/28/pham-le-quynh-tram-transgender-woman-vietnam-recognition_n_2568484.html#slide=875147.%20)

I tried coming out,"I'm a transgender male with aspergers and I've tried coming out to my father on multiple occasions. On my first attempt I had no idea how this was gonna play out, or how to even bring it up. I just said it on an impulse decision after school one day. I was 16 at the time.
He didn't accept it. He went off on a tangent, saying the transgender community was creating unnecessary problems because of the whole bathroom situation. The only message I got from that is we don't deserve equal rights, a message I promptly ignored. Then he starts to bring up points from my childhood, like how I've only been attracted to men up until this point or how I took great care in my appearance. As if my sexuality had anything to do with my gender identity or that a man can't take pride in taking care of himself and make sure he's looking his best.
I was so anxious at the time, I couldn't even look at him. I just fell mute and that was the end of it.
I'm 19 now and he still calls me his baby girl. I know that when he says that its coming from a place of love, but ever time I hint or flat out tell him I prefer being a guy he just ignores me, like it'll all just magically go away and with every passing day I become more and more resentful. Not just with him, but with myself as well. I wish I could've made a better a argument, maybe then I wouldn't hate myself as much.
